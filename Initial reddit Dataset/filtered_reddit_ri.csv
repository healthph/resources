"Need urgent advice! My clown *ss got scammed by winning prizes *coughs* or should I say, have to pay upfront to win the prizes!","can you guys/gals/etc. help my clown *ss by giving me advice on what to do next on this one. i plan to go back to them and cancel the whole transaction to tie up some loose ends, because i will not have their products, i need my money back, and i don't want them to have dirt on me because of some paperwork. i just really need some advice because i have my doubts. so for those who don't want to get scammed, the story goes like this: i receive a call claiming i have won something, probably 100k worth of household products daw, they don't know what the product is, you just have to go to the location to see what it is. my clown *ss got excited, not thinking it through, and went to the location. they guided me into their establishment filled with household products, loud music and hyper active staff, constantly buttering you up with sweet words, it was like a festive occasion. with all that upbeat music, and laughter in the room, they present you their products one by one, claiming bs like they have health benefits and all that. i was starting to get uncomfortable and doubtful of them, but then came the ""rewards"" which is what i came for. turns out i was one of the few that got ""lucky,"" 1 out of 20 that won. then they told me that i won a massage chair and a lot more! the ""prizes"" came pouring in, from one ""reward"" to another, eventually totalling into 6 ""prizes."" it was very attractive at that time. i was excited and thankful, lmao, thinking it was my lucky day, but then here comes the paper stating that in order to have all these ""prizes,"" i just need to pay a huge sum of 70k. then, all of a sudden, all the talks of ""prizes"" became ""privileges."" it instead became an offer. all the talks of not having to pay anything disappeared. since i got too caught up in the moment, and their high pressure sales tactics, i got coerced into signing some paperwork, paying them via cod. my thinking at that time was, since i was in need of some furniture, might as well get a huge deal, but it does still put a strain on my budget. after a breather outside and some thinking, i decided i don't need it and the money could be used to something more important. i went back to them to cancel the whole thing, they were reluctant saying that it was already locked in and reported to their main office. i said that i don't want the products anymore and it could put a strain on my budget. they don't want to cancel the whole thing and instead ""want to work with me"" by giving me ""allowance"" and allowing me to pay via installment. so my spineless *ss gave in and went through with it, but i actually plan to not pay them and instead go back to them sometime soon with company to put pressure on them to cancel the whole thing and terminate the contract. yes, i know, pathetic of me... any advice for me on what to do? can i really cancel the whole thing despite the signed paperwork and contract. what can i do to convince them to cancel the whole thing? what are my rights regarding this whole fiasco? tldr: got scammed by having to pay for the ""prizes"" that i won. i decided i don't want the products anymore, and demanded to cancel the transaction, they refused, and settled on a compromise, me having to pay installment. going back soon to attempt to cancel the whole thing again. need urgent advice on the matter. related threads: https://www.reddit.com/r/philippines/comments/jqtke2/may_nakatanggap_din_ba_dito_nang_tawag_on_line/",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/u1xi67/need_urgent_advice_my_clown_ss_got_scammed_by/,12 04 2022

Covid positive here. Could any fellow positives share how you think you got Covid? I think it would help others be more careful. In my case I think I got infected at a barber shop.,"i am certain i got covid from a barbershop. i went to get a haircut on the 31st and all the barbershops were closed except for one. there was a barber who was coughing. a lot. he was cutting the hair of an unmasked older gentleman who didnt seem to mind. the barber told me to sit down because he will be done shortly with cutting the hair of the older person then it would be my turn. i should have walked out. normally i avoid people coughing but i thought it didnt matter as this was the 31st - before news of the big surge. i also thought that the barber was coughing due to the cold weather. i didn't walk out. instead i had my haircut by another barber in the same shop. i hope the older guy is okay. :-( i'm fully vaxxed with astrazeneca and boostered with moderna. edit: and i have flu vaxx too. as for me i'm ok - no more colds,- slight cough with sore throat - isolating right now. 02 sats never dropped below 97 although i had a nonstop runny nose for four days. it's the worst i've ever had in my life. can you guys please share how you think you got covid? i think it would help others be more careful.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/rx1xu7/covid_positive_here_could_any_fellow_positives/,6 01 2022

The noise is driving me insane,"i've been travelling in ph for about 2 weeks now. i've been to many places in se asia but ph is by far the loudest place that i ever remember going. every place i've been to is just so extremely noisy. it is impossible to sleep after 6.30am because there will be always someone or something waking you up. i was on palawan for a week. spent a few days on the edge of a small village where i would be woken up around or before 6am by a cacophony of roosters, pigs, dogs, and a hammering neighbor who also loved to play loud music from 6am. sleeping before 1am was impossible because the nearby bar would blast music until at least that time. i hoped to find more peace in the more touristic and developed el nido, indeed there didn't seem to be many animals or hammering neighbors around my hotel, but filipino hotel guests who were talking and laughing (and sometimes screaming) loudly at breakfast at 7am more or less in front of my door. later they were replaced with other filipino guests who didn't speak much but instead played music during breakfast. currently i'm on bohol in a hotel where somebody is hammering the entire evening and morning from 6.30am. luckily they stop hammering for about 7 hours during the night. this morning it woke me up. my room is adiacent to the common area, where some filipino guests seem to be hanging out almost 24/7, talking loudly, making constant phone calls on speaker with their family and coughing as if they have long cancer. in fact, coughing and burping loudly seems to be another hobby of filipinos since the guests at the breakfast in el nido loved doing that as well. the male guest there had to burp loudly about every 20 seconds from 7 to 8 am. if that didn't disturb me enough, my current hotel faces the road where insanely loud motorbikes, buses and tricycles blaze past, constantly honking for god who knows what reason. what am i supposed to do here? and yes, i wear earplugs, even sometimes when i'm not sleeping, but the noise is just driving me absolutely crazy. how filipinos are able to live in their own country, i really don't know. it's good that i have less than a week left here, or i would go permanently insane.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/11f4a03/the_noise_is_driving_me_insane/,1 03 2023

Wtf is with people and their poor health behaviors,"i just want to rant about how one person in the family recklessly caused everyone else in the household to be sick. it all started last week when my dad experienced symptoms. as early as then, my mom would tell him to wear a mask around the house, especially considering that we also have a senior living with us. but he didn’t listen. he would react as if my mom was treating him harshly for being sick and respond with “hindi na nga ako lumalapit masyado sainyo.” he never attempted to wear a mask nor practice precautionary measures. he wouldn’t cover his mouth when coughing or sneezing—even during meals, considering that he sits at the end of the table (kabisera), in front all of us. he is disgusting. now, everyone in the household is sick, including my lola, and i hate it. it is very hard to function when sick. i am currently in my final year of college that’s why i’m busy working on my thesis, alongside my other academics, and reviewing for the nmat. but i cannot work at my highest capacity because my current health condition doesn’t permit me to. the same goes for my brother who’s reviewing for his boards. it is frustrating and infruriating. all of these could have been prevented if my father wasn't only thinking of himself. yesterday he even went out and and ate at a boodle fight. how selfish and stupid, right? i am honestly livid with him. if it were us who got sick first, he definitely would have scolded us. i don't know why also, as you're probably wondering why he would scold us for being sick. that's just how his mind works. he would get annoyed, sometimes even mad, whenever he would hear repeated coughing. that's why i usually hold my cough at home whenever i'm sick. but, lo and behold, he's been receiving all the special treatment now that he's sick. if he wasn't the head of the household, i would treat him the same way he treats us. i would make him feel like it is his fault for being sick. not to mention, my father is one of those people who do not believed in covid. since 2020, we never attempted to get tested for covid despite experiencing symptoms every now and then. he thinks it's just the regular flu. oh, and he also thinks that hospitals are crime syndicates. he's convinced that doctors purposely diagnose patients as covid positive to earn money—that those who believe otherwise have been manipulated. he's also a bbm. lol.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/wzo5wj/wtf_is_with_people_and_their_poor_health_behaviors/,28 08 2022

Our COVID story,"so kakatapos lang ng 14 day isolation namin and our lgu declared us covid recovered. i just want to share my experience regarding this. around april 19 my lola started developing a cough that progressed into pneumonia. since she hasn't gone outside since the pandemic started it took a week before our doctor recommended we get her swabbed. she tested positive april 24 and was admitted into a hospital april 27. the rest of our family got swabbed april 28 and the results came back positive for my mom and i. our lgu had us admitted into an isolation facility (15 min drive from our barangay) april 29. we stayed there for 14 days and we are currently back home. regarding our covid symptoms timeline, around the same time lola started coughing napapansin ko na ilang araw akong nahihilo at nag-lbm. nagkasore eyes din ako for a few days. day 3 sa isolation facility nawalan ako ng pang-amoy at sumama nadin yung panlasa ko. losing your sense of smell and taste is weird to say the least. as for my case i did not have any trouble breathing nor did i have a clogged nose, wala ka lang talagang maamoy at ang nalalasahan mo lang ay maalat at matamis, no complex flavors. thankfully, this only lasted for about 3-4 days. also developed a rash but thats about it. my mom developed a fever for a day and started coughing but that was quickly treated. for the facility naman i can't really complain. we stayed in a big hall type building na naka divider per cell(?)/room(?). the place was well ventilated and air conditioned. you get food 3 times a day. pwede ka rin magpadala ng extra food or other items outside from your family and friends so thats a plus. shared yung cr pero malinis naman. the facility itself was like a small subdivision, pwede ka magexercise and walk or jog around the place in the morning and in the afternoon. staff were friendly and helpful too. our whole 14 day stay was free from the accommodation to the food and the medicine. dahil most of us there were mild/asymptomatic and everyone was friendly and helpful hindi naging depressing yung atmosphere and that helped us get through the 2 weeks. sadly, my lola didn't make it and she said goodbye may 8. while my mom and i are thankful that we recovered, nakakalungkot din yung uuwi ka knowing na abo na yung isang tao na naging part ng buhay mo since bata ka. please stay safe guys. get vaccinated if you can. while we were lucky that we got through this, marami din ang hindi. if not for yourself think of those around you. the virus is and was always a big deal, i just hope more people realize that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/nb9os1/our_covid_story/,13 05 2021

[Showerthoughts] Taal Eruption helped alot of Filipinos prepare for the Corona virus by buying face masks for the ash.,"just to help out the rest of us who can't buy masks, here's how to make your own gas mask from water bottles: [https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/make-improvised-gas-mask/!] https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/make-improvised-gas-mask/ - you can find filters for masks in hardware stores like ace hardware or home depot. you can find n95 masks (recommended by who) at big hardware stores if your pharmacy runs out. remember, corona virus can also be transmitted through the eyes, so make sure you wear shades, glasses or goggles if you can. avoid rubbing your eyes for now. and make sure to wash your hands and use alcohol. hand sanitizer is not enough. avoid public places. stay home to reduce the spread. and the most important thing is to not panick. if you feel that you suddenly have a fever, cough, and trouble breathing, seek medical attention immediately. vicks and vaporub jokes aside, your life and health is no laughing matter. attention: if you guys really want to have masks, i don't recommend it since i don't think they can block out viruses (like the facemask you can buy at bangketas with coco martins smile), but you can buy filter masks and respirators at hardware stores - https://mchomedepot.com/product-category/safety-devices/mask/ if you can afford it, buy dust respirators that p3 grade or higher. here is a picture of all masks that will work with viruses: https://imgur.com/a/btb0wyj share that last link to loved ones and friends. i highly implore you to click that link for you to know what the correct mask is to buy. oh, and someone reminded me. [redacted]. if it came from a chinese supplier, that has been tested by another human by wearing it. you can sanitize it with uv-c light (be careful with using uv-c light) or just ensure that it remains untouched (days including transit) in the box for 5 days so that the mask self-sanitizes after 5 days.

Ascof Lagundi Tablet,"hello! meron na ba dito sainyo naka inom ng ascof lagundi habang buntis? nagka lagnat kasi ako last week with cough and phlegm dahil naulanan ako tas di ako agad nakaligo. then my mom gave me lagundi, she made me drink 4 tablets that day pero napraning ako if safe ba sya sa buntis? nag research nko sa youtube and fb pati sa website pero wala naman accurate na sagot. i know this post is not reddit worthy pero first pregnancy ko po kasi kaya lahat ng bagay kinaka praning ko. and if ever bawal sya, hindi naman siguro makaka apekto sa baby ko since apat lang nainom ko then inistop ko na agad. sana may maka sagot 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 edit post: sa mga mag cocomment po na dapat itanong ko ob ko, naitanong ko na yun sakanya before pa ako mag research sa internet, ang sabi niya “mukang pwede naman” dahil safe naman daw sa buntis yung lagundi leaf kaya safe din daw yung lagundi tablet. pero sabi kasi sa box ng lagundi tablet wala pa daw silang pag aaral kung pwede sa buntis, kaya confused lang po ako.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ok6ewi/ascof_lagundi_tablet/,14 07 2021
Creepy Filipino commercials in the 90s-2000s but I can't find anywhere,"hi everyone, i just want to share something as i have taken interest in lost media, thanks to the youtuber blameitonjorge. growing up as a kid in the 90s-early 2000s with less supervision with my parents regarding tv viewing for some reason, i am pretty sure i have seen some commercials or psas in either gma/abs-cbn/rpn/ibc/abc/studio 23 which really disturbed or downright scared me. &#x200b; i was that kid who had a tv in my room and the internet was hardly heard of or very niche in the philippines that time. &#x200b; as an adult, i wanted to revisit those commercials on the internet but to no avail. i wish i could see them again. here are the following commercials/psas that creeped the fuck out of me: &#x200b; 1. encarnacion bechaves commercial (late 90s)- i still clearly remember it in rpn-9 (as far as i can remember) when watching some english movies or sports. the commercial had a little girl on it, wearing a red dress as she stares creepily in a black background and there's a creepy narration that follows: ""**encarnacion bechaves**. when you want to show someone, how much you really care."". so far, the only video i found on youtube is the audio recreation: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2eueonpysw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2eueonpysw) . still sounds creepy even as a recreation but i'd love to see the real deal from my memory. 2. philippine ad congress commercials (around 2001-2003)- i always saw it in abs-cbn during the afternoon shows or during their anime programs. i also saw it on studio 23. what disturbed me is the videos are usually shown in a monochromatic filter with white text in black background on the right, and the background music creeped me out as it was sounding like a lonely traditional instrument which i don't know how you call it.....i just remembered a twangy sound and during the end of the commercial, it has that distinct xylophone-like tone and it flashes the philippine ad congress icon. the said icon is a drawing of a head designed to look like a bulb. 3. stop the war psa (around 2000-2004)- i saw it during the eat bulaga commercial breaks. the psa was just a black background with white and red words then it has some firey backdrop in the middle of it. what scared me is the humming background music which sounds really haunting as the psa stated why war is horrifying. the psa ends with a woman singing the phrase, ""stop the war"". 4. vaporin commercial (late 90s)- i saw it on rpn-9 and maybe the drawing of the respiratory system with its veiny glory creeped me out. the commercial showed like how the drug can clear your cough and phlegm in your lungs if you take vaporin. what added the creepiness is the male voiceover with hardly any background music. deep voice with the added analog hissings on the recording. actually, i'm not sure if the brand is really vaporin or some related cough remedy. 5. studio 23 halloween movie bumpers (2003?)- there was a daily tagalog movie segment on studio 23 during 12 noon. that was halloween week on 2003 where the bumper featured really freaky tagalog horror films. what scared the shit out of me was the wag bubuhayin ang bangkay bumpers. yes, i watched the movie when it was shown, i still remember it was on a friday afternoon. the scene stuck me when the actor came back to life with his disturbed mom and he suddenly played the piano, looking like a zombie. i didn't sleep well for days since then. i'd be so glad if you guys can start a discussion or even add more on my list of creepy commercials or psas from memory. what i'd be so glad is having leads for the said ""lost"" commercials that made my childhood more interesting and couldn't be replicated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/myx2e7/creepy_filipino_commercials_in_the_90s2000s_but_i/,26 04 2021
"Where to Look for Medical Assistance, DAD IS IN VEGETATIVE STATE amidst COVID-19 Pandemic","i'm sorry but i don't know where else to go. so i'm going to give it a try here. please help us, where can we find government assistance or any financial assistance to help is cover hospital bills for my dad? he does not have medical or life insurance. only has philhealth and his senior citizen discount. we are just 3 siblings caring for him, and all of us are barely earning due to the lockdown. our families have tried sending help, but they are also barely surviving so they can't send a lot. please help us, we don't know what else to do. this started in the morning of august 12. we were happily having breakfast and my 70 y.o. dad was about to sit down on the couch and suddenly collapsed. he had already lost his bodily functions by then. we rushed him immediately to many hospitals, but sadly were rejected one after another. we were only able to receive proper treatment in the afternoon at uerm, but they also had full bed capacity. he waited in the er for hours while we searched for a hospital. regrettably, we were only able to get a room in cardinal santos, a very expensive hospital, because it was the only one with an icu ready and it was already 4am. at the time, we prioritized getting my dad admitted without thinking about the possible charges. my dad was diagnosed with aphasic stroke, wherein the dominant part of the left side of his brain was hit by the blood clot. this stopped all comprehensive functions (sight, hearing, talking, and eating). he can slightly move his limbs but only when he feels pain. he is conscious but can only open his eyes, which will only last for a few seconds and he will sleep again. this is because his brain is still swelling due to the blood clot and causes him to feel drowsy. because he can't control his throat muscles, he can't cough out the accumulated mucus in his lungs. we're praying that this will not lead to pneumonia. after 3 days, we finally got him to get transferred to a regular room so we could be with him. but this did not mean he was in a better condition. we could hear his heavy breathing due to phlegm build-up. we were advised to have surgery wherein part of his skull will be removed to allow his swollen brain to breathe, but this would still lead him to become vegetative because of his old age. it will only allow him to stay alive while being attached to a machine. the surgery is also very expensive, minimum fee is at ₱800k and above. we were also asked to intubate him but we also refused because of the risk of his heart stopping. right now, we are fighting for him but we don't want to push him to become alive for our sake at the expense of him suffering even more. that's why we decided to take care of him personally in a regular room, no matter how long it takes. but this required us to take turns watching him, affecting our daily jobs and it is just us 3 siblings who can take care of him. it's just been 4 days now but the bill is already at ₱273k without the 20% senior citizen discount. we've been asking for financial help from our friends and family, but they are not enough especially because we don't know for how long my dad will be staying in the room. if you have any idea where we can ask for help, please let us know. your prayers will also be a big help to my father. thank you so much.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/iamb77/where_to_look_for_medical_assistance_dad_is_in/,16 08 2020

"Did I get Covid & just recovered very quickly, or just another flu?","just curious if anyone’s also experienced this, especially since there’s a mini-surge in people getting sick in manila. i know so many people who got covid-symptoms yet tested negative in their antigen tests. my sister got exposed to someone with covid symptoms. day 2 after exposure, they notified us of their symptoms, and in day 3 we also started feeling sick. i already got covid before and i had a hunch it’s covid again since the symptoms felt all-too-familiar (but this time, milder). my sister took an antigen on day 3 and she tested negative. her friends who were also sick also bore negative antigen results. i took an antigen test on day 4 and i also tested negative. however, i also took an rt-pcr test the next day (day 5) to be sure (which also showed negative results). i already feel much better at day 5, but it got me thinking if we really got covid or not? because all the symptoms i felt when i got infected 4 months ago were exactly the same (headache, fatigue, sore throat, cough, runny & clogged nose, fever), except milder (didn’t get a fever this time). i also immediately took medicine for covid on day 3 when i felt the symptoms (so that might be a factor as well to the decreased symptoms & fast recovery?) or maybe a new milder covid strain? or a new flu",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/zrucf4/did_i_get_covid_just_recovered_very_quickly_or/,21 12 2022

Just diagnosed with HIV,"hi. i (23m) just got diagnosed with hiv. i will still undergo a confirmatory test on wednesday to see if i really do have the virus. i only took 2 rapid antigen tests and they came back positive, and the test kits are highly accurate. when i took my first antigen test on august 20 and got the result, it was a weird feeling. i have been very sickly for almost a year now, and now that i have my results, i finally know why. i just want to get this off my chest. i have already accepted my diagnosis and i'm glad that receiving my diagnosis wasn't so bad as others. maybe it has not sunken it yet? idk. i hope that i'd really come into terms with this chronic illness. what's really bothersome for me is, i am a person with big, big dreams. i have always been looking forward to the future. right now, i am a graduating student practicing physical therapy. the thing is, when i got my diagnosis, i wasn't afraid of how deadly or how potentially life-threatening it is. instead, i was more afraid of how it can potentially impact my life from now on. i've always had a map, a direction of where i wanted to go in my life, but now, idk what to do anymore. i don't know what kinds of opportunities that were just stripped off from me, and i am yet to find out. i definitely know that life is going to be different from now on, and nothing has prepared me for this. i can't even tell my parents about this. from my family, i just told my sister. luckily, treatment is going to be for free and that's convenient so i don't have to rely on my parents. huge shoutout to loveyourself! they have been amazing in delivering their service. it brings me comfort to just see how passionate the people who are working there. as for me, i'm still yet to see. it's going to be a different life from now on. i know i got this, i just have to continue moving forward update: hello, i've read all of your comments! thank you all so much for your affirming words 🙏🏼 i'm very glad na i sparked this discourse and people are getting educated by it! i feel so much better than yesterday when i posted it, it's just amazing na there are understanding people! i would just like to answer some very common questions from the comments: how did you acquire it? - i engage in very risky sexual behaviors. mostly m2m, and i do it unprotected sometimes. mostly oral lahat, wasn't really into penetrative sex. for 3 years, i've mostly engaged in oral sex lang with people i met online and usually ako yung *insertive* sa role. since then, twice lang ako nakapag anal but puro protected. i'm thinking na maybe i got it through oral sex and take note ah na it's rare to acquire it via oral sex. this is a lesson to all! what were your symptoms? - for almost a year, i was very sickly talaga. september last year, i contracted amoebiasis and i didn't get treated for it until january when i was hospitalized due to sever malnutrition and dehydration. they did try to rule out hiv while i was treated, but since i had a primary diagnosis at that time, they didn't bother testing hiv nalang. over those months, onting ulan lang, i'd get sick na. it was every week na i'd get a fever! again, i did not think na it was because of hiv since i contracted amoebiasis at the time. the reason why i delayed my treatment lang was sobrang hirap kumuha ng med cert from my school. plus, i didn't want to make up for any missed activities or exams and at that time it was hell months sa gawain and all. they had to isolate me for 2 weeks kasi i had diarrhea and it was a symptom of covid (i know, pretty messed up yung clinic namin). i know it's very ironic of me, a medical course student, who chose to be sick than getting treated dahil lang sa school works. fast forward to february this year when i was discharged, it seemed like i never really got better. i was still having stomach problems and my oral thrush came back, even after weeks of taking prescription medications for it. i had enlarged lymph nodes around my neck to which my doctor prescribed me with antibiotics and nag shrink din naman yung lymph nodes ko. since feb ang masasabi ko lang na pinaka complaint ko is just the fatigue. i didn't have the energy that i used to have. and i just notice na i'm weaker. maffeel mo talaga na something is wrong sa body mo. that's the best way to describe it. what made you decide to get tested? - it was a message from the universe. may nakita lang ako na ad sa facebook by self care about free testing kits that they give out and get delivered to your doorstep. i ordered mine ng august 13 and dumating yung kit ng august 20 (you decide the date that's most convenient for you cause you have to sign some paperwork before it gets handed to you). i was curious lang din to know my status. how much will the treatment cost? - free. as long as may philhealth insurance ka, it's gonna be for free. don ako sa loveyourself sa shaw boulevard pumunta. but, some testing procedures are not going to be for free. i will update on this soon since i will be going back to the doctor ng wednesday. but treatment is generally for free",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/162t88p/just_diagnosed_with_hiv/,27 08 2023

My job is requiring me to take a rapid test after one day of absence. Need advice.,"last friday, i was absent on my work because i had a really intense panic attack. i'm a trainee in a call center, and it was my first time taking calls last thursday. the reason for my panic attacks last friday was that i felt really terrified of taking calls that i spent hours crying, and i felt like i would rather just die than take another of those calls. coz i mean, if you're also working/ have worked in a call center you get me when i say that the customers/clients can really be mean and put you down like you're some garbage right? anyway, to add, i have social anxiety, and i am diagnosed with bipolar 2. it really also doesn't help that the calls are not scripted, and you have to really converse with the customer on your own. this is my first job ever, and i didn't expect it to be like that. i'm good at english and all, but the words that i heard affected me too much the next day. idk if it was my bipolar getting triggered, but long story short, i decided to just take a day off for my mental health. i can really be impulsive, and suicidal when i'm in this state, hence why i thought it would be right to take a pause for a day. philippines isn't really great at understanding and handling mental disorders. so, i just thought it would be okay to just tell my trainer that i'll be absent because i have a fever instead of saying “i'm having a severe panic attack.” well now i have a problem because the work is requiring me to provide a medical certificate and fit to work clearance within 24 hours of my absence because i said i have a fever. so, what i did was, i went into nowserving and booked myself an appointment. i got a virtual consultation with a doctor and was able to provide the certificate & clearance. i thought it would all be fine but turns out, virtual consultation, they said, is invalid and that i still need to have a face to face consultation today. that it's a protocol that even if i do get a face-to-face consultation with a doctor today, they are still requiring me to either quarantine myself for 7 days or get a rapid/swab test. i cannot afford either to not work for 7 days or afford to get a rapid/swab test. i need money because therapy is not cheap at all, and i need to support my family. idk what to do. i don't know if i should just beg or just tell the truth about what happened. i'm worried that if i tell the truth, it would impact on me negatively. &#x200b; note: i'm 19, and i was on my 3rd year of college. family and financial problems happened, so i needed to quit college. i don't have a bachelors, so getting a job that pays enough is quite hard. also, no disrespect please. i am just really in need of advice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/yvlxfm/my_job_is_requiring_me_to_take_a_rapid_test_after/,15 11 2022

Popburri says the Quezon City restaurant has to close its shelter to the homeless after the barangay chairman ordered it to stop operating for allegedly violating quarantine protocols.,"at 6am this morning kagawad julius sevilla announced the permanent shut down of the popburri homeless shelter at 67 k-8 street east kamias qc. this was in response to the decision made by our barangay captain octavio ""bing"" garces on march 27. the reason for this shutdown is the violation of the quarantine protocols enforced by the barangay. for the record, we at popburri learned along the way to enforce the protocols required. yesterday we are proud to have set up stations in the effort to comply with the quarantine protocols, namely mandatory fever check (with two fever guns), mandatory health interview, mandatory bleach and soap foot wash, mandatory shower, mandatory face mask, mandatory bag check for all items, and 1 meter distance in sleeping, eating and lining up. last night 72 homeless clients slept safe and sound under these protocols. unfortunately, these did not meet the requirements. the lord gives us leaders in our nation that see further than we can, and often are more knowledgeable in many aspects and therefore we respectfully honor the decision made by our barangay leaders. today at 4pm, we will be distributing grocery bags with the donations given by all of you wonderful popburri friends, customers, neighbors and nagmamahal na mamamayan. we will also be driving around to locations where the karitons sit within our community to distribute goods until this lockdown ends. thank you for the opportunity for our team- michelle, jethro, e-john, coco, char, lois, john, jay, noy, lowell and camille to witness bayanihan in our community, and god's hands at work to help the most vulnerable. i hope this is only the beginning of the process to get them permanently off the street and hope together we can create an alternative, long lasting solution to our issue of homelessness. -love, the popburri team",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/fqe3a9/popburri_says_the_quezon_city_restaurant_has_to/,28 03 2020

Our football stadiums suck!!,"this post is a reaction to that tiktok video rant about why football isn't as popular here. nakikisabay siya sa world cup fever, i know, but to be honest, it's normal na mainggit, kasi nakakainggit naman talaga. one major reason why football is not that popular is the abhorring lack of proper sports infrastructure. unlike basketball and volleyball na pwedeng gumamit ng multipurpose court anytime, anywhere, football fields and stadiums are very few and far in between. take note, politicians and those working for dpwh and the local engineering offices, alam kong lurkers kayo dito. because, really, our football stadiums suck!! manila, marikina, bocaue, clark, at bacolod lang may matinong stand-alone stadiums. probably the ones in marawi, roxas city, vigan, and puerto princesa as well, but all of them are simply too small. most of the stadiums we have are built alongside school grounds, like the ones in tuguegarao, lingayen, makati, lucena, iloilo, cebu, cagayan de oro, and zamboanga. same case with the new stadiums in san fernando, laoag, and sorsogon city. perdices in dumaguete naman was built at the back of the provincial capitol, the result is wala nang room for expansion. tapos, kung may matinong sports complexes naman, they're mainly built to host the palarong pambansa and they're either built right smack in the middle of fucking nowhere or pinabayaan na lang matapos ang event. this is the case in tubod, siargao, san jose de buenavista, imus, biñan, and ilagan. so in terms of accessibility pa lang, bagsak na. football stadiums are supposed to be accessible to everyone, whether they be local football teams na nagpa practice, people jogging at any time of the day, or other people utilizing them as venues. but we definitely lack proper infrastructure to support homegrown groups, let alone a national football league. we have to clamor the government, both at the national at local level, to invest more in sports, kasi kulang na kulang talaga.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/zd1pg7/our_football_stadiums_suck/,5 12 2022

My Medical Abortion experience in the Philippines,"it's been over a month since i had a successful medical abortion (ma). i live in the philippines and it's illegal here. found a helpful group of women on facebook and they helped me throughout the process. i found out i was pregnant last week of january. dec and jan are such busy months in my line of work that i couldn't even recall if i had my period for both months. i finally took a pregnancy test and two lines appeared almost instantaneously. my boyfriend and i are both financially unstable. we're also far from ready to be parents. and tbh, with how the world is turning out, i find it absurd for anyone to subject another human being to this cruelty we call life/living; so we agreed to have it aborted. luckily, i am a nursing graduate and a bit knowledgeable about the process of how to terminate birth (i am not a nurse anymore). since i am still in my first trimester, i know that i can abort it through oral medication. we searched all corners of the internet for the pills needed. found several websites like women on web, safe2choose, etc, which led me to this certain organization for women's health. a friend also suggested an fb page that also advocates women's health, but they don't reply promptly. my boyfriend and i decided to visit one of the clinics of the said women's health org (a day after we got a positive pt). and as expected, they were only giving post-abortion care assistance. legally, that's the only thing they can offer for help. 🥲 the volunteer from the said org was the one who urged me to get a transvaginal ultrasound (tvs). just so everyone knows, you don't need a doctor's referral to get one. a missed period and a positive pt are enough reasons for you to get a tvs. while waiting for my tvs result, the volunteer who urged me to have my tvs sent me a text referring me to a person who she said can 'help' me with this dilemma. we immediately texted the number. he replied and said he was a doctor and was offering me a surgical procedure. he was really pushy which i find really sketchy. also, i don't want to opt for a surgical procedure. so we parked that option first. a few days passed and that fb group that also advocates women's health replied; i was able to talk to the sweetest nurse over the phone. she wasn't at all judgmental about my decision. unfortunately, she doesn't have a source for the pills, but she referred me to fredli's group of doctors and gave me the assistant's contact number. i did find several rappler articles about fredli while doing the web rounds before the nurse from that fb group even mentioned them to us. we contacted the number she gave us and they replied promptly. we didn't proceed with them because they are way out of our budget and the assistant (and all the written documents that they sent over) sounds really rude. but i am not taking that against them, i know they're just extra careful because it is illegal after all. while all of this was happening, i was also talking to a seller i found on facebook. she invited me to one of their group chats with other sellers and customers. on the group chat, they post proofs and testimonials; customers may also ask questions. you may observe before purchasing. they eventually gained my trust when several customers on the group chat i messaged privately attested to them. they have several packages/sets depending on what trimester you're in. they cater up to 6mos of pregnancy, i believe! i purchased the package recommended to me and paid thru gcash. received the package the next day; it was wrapped in a very discreet manner. i spent a week on the preparation my seller told me to do before proceeding with the procedure. she told me to do heavy exercises, drink pineapple juice and ginger tea (pinakuluang luya) multiple times daily, and several other things i cannot attest to if it did help. i was already on my 7th wk (and 3rd day) when i was fully prepared to undergo the ma procedure. the set i got has 6 misoprostol (cytotec), 4 mifepristone, and 6 methergine. my seller guided me throughout the procedure via chat and gc. the procedure was overall ok except for the part that i needed to hold for several hours to what seems like a very watery poop. the cramps during the procedure were very tolerable for me as well. had a mild fever in the first few hours. on my fifth hour of taking the meds, i was able to push the fetus out along with the placenta (i can send you a photo if you're not that squeamish). hehe! post-abortion was way worse than the procedure itself. i never had dysmenorrhea in my entire womanhood. i have a high tolerance for pain as well, but those cramps post-abortion kept me in bed for several days. the pain was so painful i had to take ibuprofen for it. the bleeding was also intermittent. i was blood/spotting-free after 3-4wks. it has been a month and a week now since i had a successful medical abortion. i just took another pt this morning, and it is now negative. i am also on the first day of my period since i had an abortion. yey! fyi: you should take a pt after 3-4wks of a successful ma, and it should be negative. i never fully realized how compromised we are as women with the current laws we have for women's reproductive health until i got pregnant and needed an abortion. ma is such a simple and safe procedure and yet we are not provided with that choice in our country just because 🤷🏻‍♀️. i hope noone has to go through this same experience, but if ever you're in one, don't hesitate to message me. i am more than willing to help. p.s. happy women's month!!!

Clearing up misconceptions about 2019-nCoV,"yesterday, during the parents' plenary in lpu, i've had the honor of listening to prof. oliver dumaoal's briefing on ncov - and i would like to give him credit for doing an incredible job of explaining to parents and students about the situation of this newfound virus. with that being said, and as a sci-tech editor of my school paper, here's my attempt to explain everything he said in hopes to change everyone's perspective of novel coronavirus. what is this? 2019 novel coronavirus (connoted as ncov) is a virus outbreak that apparently originated from wuhan, china. as the newest addition to the coronavirus family (sars-cov and mers-cov are its ""older"" siblings), it possesses some traits similar to the previous viruses. according to the centers for disease control and prevention, its symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. once infected, these symptoms will appear between 2 to 14 days. but most of the confirmed cases have shown that it takes longer times before these symptoms appear. currently, there is no particular cure for the virus. its symptoms, however, are a different story. according to reports, most people become asymptomatic when they're prescribed with medicine for the symptoms (paracetamol, the most commonly used drug used to treat fever, helps patients with ncov deal with fever and thus become asymptomatic after a few days.) how do you get infected? a person carrying this virus, according to statistics, can infect 2 people on average. numerous risk assessments and other statistics have shown that compared to the number of people infected by measles, you are much less likely to be infected by ncov. an explanation for this would be the transmission of the virus. ncov isn't an airborne virus: it can only be transmitted via body fluids (coughing, sneezing, and transmission of saliva.) simply put, a person cannot be infected easily by the virus, especially by breathing in public places. a person can only be infected if he is in close contact with the virus, if he touches something contaminated by the infected person's sneeze or coughs, or if an infected person sneezes on another person. on note of hygiene however, a person is vulnerable or at risk of being infected if the person does not practice proper hygiene. although the risk of being infected is relatively low, it significantly decreases if a person washes his hands regularly and properly. surgical masks are excellent in preventing airborne diseases, and it helps in decreasing the risk of getting infected; however, this isn't necessary for countries like the philippines, since there are only a few suspected cases of the virus. additionally, the best method of preventing yourself from being infected would be washing your hands thoroughly and regularly. should i get checked? there are few criteria for being checked for the virus. if a person has close contact with an infected person, if the person has contacted an infected person's body fluids, or if you have been to the province of hubei (particularly in the city of wuhan) in the past week or month, then it is best to get checked for the virus. however, if you answered ""no"" to the criteria mentioned, then there is no need to be alarmed. the public outcry for novel coronavirus has been misinterpreted: your risk of getting infected is low, its symptoms can be easily cured, and it is easily preventable. what's more, the ratio of people dying to the virus to the number of confirmed cases of infection is low (as of 31 january 2020, 213 have died while 9826 are confirmed to have the virus, a 1:50 ratio of deaths to confirmed cases.) we can never be too safe with this virus. although the posed threat for the virus is blown out of proportion, there's no harm in washing your hands more often to prevent the virus from spreading. stay safe, wash your hands more often, and be vigilant. sources: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019 https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200131-sitrep-11-ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=de7c0f7_2 https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/risk-assessment-pneumonia-wuhan-china-22-jan-2020.pdf",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ex2ory/clearing_up_misconceptions_about_2019ncov/,1 02 2020

"If there's nothing else you can do to help, be kinder.","this covid epidemic is rearing to be the biggest natural disaster that we have faced since typhoon yolanda. even as early as now the economic and social impact is starting to affect the country, especially the poor and the working class. unfortunately, things are likely to get worse. each one of us will be affected, but not all of us will be affected the same way, and that may be the key to cushioning the blow of the pandemic for the lot of us. pain is inevitable, but suffering can be optional. if you can still remember how the entire nation cooperated to help out after the typhoon yolanda hit, so should it be, if not more so, now. there is no weathering this storm without making sure your neighbors weather it too. we're all in this together. if there's nothing else you can do, let's be kinder to one another. if you have a surplus, share. it does not have to be charity. patronize people's livelihoods. if you have a choice between giving your money to a corporate business and a family store, go for the store. if you need services, you can still avail them as long as you take the necessary precautions to prevent transmission. money circulating the community means food for stomachs, medicine for illnesses. if you can afford to tip, tip graciously. it may not mean much to you, but it could be a life changing choice down the line for somebody else. if you have money to lend, lend. if you have food medicine and supplies to spare, share. if you have talents, what better time to make them shine and what nobler a reason if for another person? if you have nothing but a mouth to speak out of, encourage. assure. if you have nothing but a listening ear, hear people out. be more understanding of other peoples' plight. everybody is going through something one way or another. emotions will likely be at fever pitch due to this. but now more than ever we need to stick together. now is not the time for division, disagreement. there is nothing to be gained from gloating, from bickering. people who are right will not be spared from danger any more than people who are wrong. instead of arguments, we need dialogue. instead of insults, we need information. there will be plenty of time to discuss semantics once the weather has cleared, but for now, the more we are all on the same page about what is going on around us, the better our chances will be. sincerity is the key to understanding. and understanding is the key to cooperation. we will likely never have the same political leanings. the same religion. the same preferences for what we thing is right or just. and that is just the reality. what we have the same of right now is the same danger that is facing not just us but our families, our friends, our community. our nation. we can criticize, but we also need to cooperate. we can disagree, but above all we need to compromise. help each other. be gracious in accepting and magnanimous in offering help. start in your small ways. ask to pay things forward. for if there's anything more infectious than covid-19, it is kindness. it spreads far and wide beyond checkpoints and quarantines, beyond religious, political, and geographical barriers. it is afraid neither of shadows nor the light. it stays with people. it changes people, even if a little, that it goes on to reflect on everybody else exposed to it. there will be no easy way out of what we are facing and we are all called to do our part in our own ways big and small. but if there is nothing else, be kinder. thank you for reading. edit: holy shit this blew up. grammatical mistakes and all. thanks everyone. as the great jackie moon once said, ""everybody love everybody!""",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/fja9z4/if_theres_nothing_else_you_can_do_to_help_be/,15 03 2020

(you can also just turn the shower on hot and sit in the bathroom breathing in the steam). also a good time to make a big batch of your favorite soup to freeze and have on hand. if you have a history of asthma and you have a prescription inhaler, make sure the one you have isn't expired and refill it/get a new one if it is. > >you basically just want to prepare as though you know you're going to get a nasty respiratory bug like bronchitis or pneumonia. you just have the foresight to know it's coming. > >for symptom management, use the meds i mentioned. for a fever over 101 f, alternate tylenol and advil so you're taking a dose of one or the other every 3 hours. use both cough suppressants and expectorants (most cough meds have both). drink a ton, hydrate hydrate. rest lots. > >if you're sick, you should not be leaving your house except to go to the doctor, and if you do, wear a mask (regular is fine, you don't need an n95). you do not need to go to the e.r. unless you are having trouble breathing or your fever is very high and unmanaged with meds. > >90% of healthy adult cases thus far have been managed at home with basic rest/hydration/over-the-counter meds. we don't want to clog the ers unless you're actually in distress. the hospital beds will be used for people who apamctively [sic] need oxygen/breathing treatments/iv fluids. > >if you have a pre-existing lung condition (copd, emphysema, lung cancer) or are on immunosuppressants, now is a great time to talk to your pcp or specialist about what they would like you to do if you get sick. they might have plans to get you admitted and bypass the er entirely. > >one major relief to you parents is that kids do very well with coronavirus— they usually bounce back in a few days, no one under 18 has died, and almost no kids have required hospitalization (unless they have a lung disease like cf). just use pediatric dosing of the same meds.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/fjp8rx/managing_covid19_without_hospitalization_longish/,16 03 2020

Rapid test igM positive,"i was hired for work and i was required to do a rapid test before starting, turned out that i was igm weak positive. i felt nothing. all i remember was i had fever, colds and sore throat a month ago and it went off already. sa ngayon, wala na. wala akong sakit. i was shocked and emotional as soon as i saw the results. i only told a trusted friend and my parents. i kept crying because i think, ""paano nalang mga kapatid kong katabi kong matulog,"" ""paano nalang yung mga nakasama ko."" i was so worried. i did what i could — i practiced social distancing, wore my face mask and face shield everywhere i go, and i constantly put alcohol on my hands. as soon as i get home, i change clothes and wash myself plus i drink vitamin c at night before sleeping. i did what i could, but where did i go wrong? the doctor advised that i should monitor symptoms and i am required to do a 2-week home isolation. saw articles that there were really false positives in antibody tests. my friend told me that i should take this in a positive manner since i can see that my immune system is working and is fighting against infection. pero nakakatrauma talaga yung positive rapid test result. eto ako ngayon, naka self-quarantine. wala paring sakit. pero psychologically traumatized.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/i6kpnz/rapid_test_igm_positive/,9 08 2020
People you met that you feel had psychopathic tendencies?,"medyo maiba naman, medyo nagkakafatigue na din ako with the election fever. as the title says, nagka-interaction na ba kayo with someone you felt had psychopathic tendencies? this thought actually came to me since i was watching some true crime videos and criminal psychology on youtube (jcs, ewu, etc.), and seeing that the genre is quite famous na din ok netflix, maybe marami na ding nanonood here. anyway, na-notice ko na may mga iniinterview sila sa cases na former classmates ng criminal, and that they already shown signs even then. this suddenly reminded me when i was in 3rd year high school, where we had a transfer student. he looked relatively normal naman; the most notable lang siguro is yung minor speech impediment nya. anyway, since it's already late in our high school lives, medyo established na yung friend groups, and he wasn't the interactive type; borderline weird. since may mga aloof naman talaga, we didn't really mind at all. i talk to him periodically, para hindi siya sobrang distant sa section. now, the obligatory *talk what you did in you summer vacation* thingy is pushed onto us, pero put into drawing. para daw may konting twist. *twist my arm*, i thought. everyone had the generic answers; basketball, swimming, tulog, etc. this guy was also a gamer. *heeeey, nice, at least may common ground na ng konti*. he drew a counter strike-call of duty-generic fps protag for us to see, then explained na he was into this. we didn't know him too well, kaya we brushed it off. i didn't mind, since fps was pretty good and addicting naman for others. we kinda had small talks with gaming things, and the he opened up that he was into guns more. waaaaaay too into guns, as in he was shooting a barrage at me with too much gun info. i frankly cannot keep up, nor care, kaya i just shut up and let it go, thinking nothing of it; wala kasi akong prejudice about hobbies and interests. nothing really came of it anyway. and then he just didn't attend school after a few days. as in nothing. i never heard anything about him up to this day, nakalimutan ko nga din yung name nya eh, since i never took notice of anything at the time. pero on retrospect, watching these on youtube, napa-isip ako: is that a sign of a psychopathic tendency? or am i just watching too much of these things? then i proceed to watch some more. share your stories for a change of pace!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/u6bytt/people_you_met_that_you_feel_had_psychopathic/,18 04 2022
Current student education status and experience (opinion),"did you ever notice that despite the 5 day classes from 7 to 5 you still do less and learn more than today's self learning and online classes? i remember last year that despite my common absence from school (always sick) i have no problems coping with anything. i miss 3 weeks of classes? easy. teacher talks and i can learn without even taking notes except on very specific things. i remember before october 5 i was sure that the modules will be easy to understand and answer but oh boy was i wrong. the essay parts are easy but when it comes to understanding the lessons you would spend more effort just trying to get even the slightest idea of what the passage was talking about. confusing grammar, not enough details, no proper illustrations on equations. its a mess a friend of mine in college says he has a lot of deadlines and he has fever at the moment. he's basically powering through to pass his requirements. maybe its just my time management that's the problem, but everytime i look at the modules my motivation just gets sucked out of me. i just feel like its even more work than being in school listening to teachers. anyway, my point is its not engaging nor enjoyable, not even informative and just a pain in the head to do. you just can't get the motivation to even write anything because the only thing pushing you to do it is the weekly deadline. to all my fellow students out there, take a break from time to time for yourself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/jtad2f/current_student_education_status_and_experience/,13 11 2020

[redacted]. if it came from a chinese supplier, that has been tested by another human by wearing it. you can sanitize it with uv-c light (be careful with using uv-c light) or just ensure that it remains untouched (days including transit) in the box for 5 days so that the mask self-sanitizes after 5 days.

Our COVID story,"so kakatapos lang ng 14 day isolation namin and our lgu declared us covid recovered. i just want to share my experience regarding this. around april 19 my lola started developing a cough that progressed into pneumonia. since she hasn't gone outside since the pandemic started it took a week before our doctor recommended we get her swabbed. she tested positive april 24 and was admitted into a hospital april 27. the rest of our family got swabbed april 28 and the results came back positive for my mom and i. our lgu had us admitted into an isolation facility (15 min drive from our barangay) april 29. we stayed there for 14 days and we are currently back home. regarding our covid symptoms timeline, around the same time lola started coughing napapansin ko na ilang araw akong nahihilo at nag-lbm. nagkasore eyes din ako for a few days. day 3 sa isolation facility nawalan ako ng pang-amoy at sumama nadin yung panlasa ko. losing your sense of smell and taste is weird to say the least. as for my case i did not have any trouble breathing nor did i have a clogged nose, wala ka lang talagang maamoy at ang nalalasahan mo lang ay maalat at matamis, no complex flavors. thankfully, this only lasted for about 3-4 days. also developed a rash but thats about it. my mom developed a fever for a day and started coughing but that was quickly treated. for the facility naman i can't really complain. we stayed in a big hall type building na naka divider per cell(?)/room(?). the place was well ventilated and air conditioned. you get food 3 times a day. pwede ka rin magpadala ng extra food or other items outside from your family and friends so thats a plus. shared yung cr pero malinis naman. the facility itself was like a small subdivision, pwede ka magexercise and walk or jog around the place in the morning and in the afternoon. staff were friendly and helpful too. our whole 14 day stay was free from the accommodation to the food and the medicine. dahil most of us there were mild/asymptomatic and everyone was friendly and helpful hindi naging depressing yung atmosphere and that helped us get through the 2 weeks. sadly, my lola didn't make it and she said goodbye may 8. while my mom and i are thankful that we recovered, nakakalungkot din yung uuwi ka knowing na abo na yung isang tao na naging part ng buhay mo since bata ka. please stay safe guys. get vaccinated if you can. while we were lucky that we got through this, marami din ang hindi. if not for yourself think of those around you. the virus is and was always a big deal, i just hope more people realize that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/nb9os1/our_covid_story/,13 05 2021
On Pork Imports and the Threat to Hog Industry,"yesterday, president duterte signed [executive order no. 128](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1416103/duterte-temporarily-cuts-tariff-rate-for-imported-pork-products). this temporarily lowers the in-quota tariff from 30 % down to a staggering 5 %. the above quota meanwhile is lowered from 40 % to 15 %. for the uninformed, in-quota tariffs simply means an imposed tax or duties within the prescribed minimum access volume (mav) or import quota; any import beyond that is subject to above quota/out-quota tariffs. at first glance, it seems sensible to allow more pork imports to resolve an undersupply of pork. that is, if you believe that it's totally an issue of supply. note that even the department of agriculture in early [january](https://news.abs-cbn.com/business/01/08/21/da-ensures-pork-supply-from-visayas-mindanao-as-prices-surge-in-luzon) and [february](https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1130877) did not believe that the spike in pork prices was an issue of supply. now, the [cheapest farmgate price](https://www.rappler.com/business/department-agriculture-yet-show-proof-pork-price-manipulation) is at p180 per kilo in general santos city. provinces near metro manila is around p200 to p220 per kilo. thus, for the samahang industriya ng agrikultura, a retail price between p330 - p380 per kilo is only acceptable. can we blame our local hog producers for the african swine fever (asf) and restricted transportation? the real score: the problem with pork is a [problem of distribution](https://mb.com.ph/2020/09/14/import-bans-to-hike-meat-prices-by-christmas/). the shortage in luzon was a result of it being the hardest hit in the region of asf, while there really is a surplus in visayas and mindanao. in line with the problem of distribution, farmers called for gov't to compensate asf-hit pork producers and subsidize the transportation of pork. another proposed resolution was to ask malacanang to declare a public emergency, to allow the da to realign funds to address asf infestation, in the form of fund assistance. let's compare that to the imported pork. did you know that the [data](https://www.philstar.com/business/2021/03/26/2086964/higher-tariff-pork-imports-put-hold) from the bureau of customs (boc) shows that the declared price or landed meat of swine averaged at p81 per kilo from january 2020 to january 2021? how much do importers sell it for retail? p350 to p450 (between january and february when local pork registered spikes)! just imagine their profit margin! who profits besides pork importers? well, their international partners. other countries wanting to open the philippine economy and flood them with imports. here's what an american senior trade editor [wrote](https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/15653-philippines-opens-up-to-more-pork-imports): ""the philippines, already a big importer of u.s. pork, is lowering its tariffs to allow for more foreign supplies as the country continues to battle african swine fever, according to an announcement made wednesday by the national pork producers council. \[...\] the expanded market access is expected to generate significantly more u.s. pork exports to the country."" anyone with a sense of history knows that our history is a history of free trade. so why did the department of agriculture retracted? profit, profit, profit, people. and kickbacks! from confidence in supply to recommending a 650 % increase in minimum access volume. jess cham, president of meat importers and traders association, and their group even pegs the meat supply deficit at [six million metric tons](https://www.cnnphilippines.com/business/2021/2/8/pork-supple-tighten-price-freeze-.html). [senator lacson](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1407308/lacson-bares-p6b-tongpats-scheme-in-pork-importation) actually already raised concerns over an alleged money-making scheme in the importation of meat. an 'insider' information estimate revealed by lacson said that a syndicate within the da collecting p5-p7 a kilo from imported meat may earn 'tongpats' amounting to p6 billion a year. lacson's number, however, was capped at 400,000 metric tons, while duterte's a little over a week ago pushed it to 404, 210 as recommended by da. if true, kickbacks would exceed beyond the 6 billion estimate of lacson. do note, however, that mav or import quota doesn't mean quantitative restriction, 15 % out-quota tariff itself is too low to import more and more. in line with this, da already allotted p45m for freezers or chillers to be distributed in metro manila in wet markets for the imported pork. but what's p45m compared to billions of kickbacks? with that [hog raisers warned](https://news.abs-cbn.com/business/03/28/21/hog-raisers-to-stop-operations-if-govt-cuts-pork-tariff-industry-group) that they will be forced to stop their operations, for the effect alone of 350,000 metric tons is equivalent to 8,000,000 heads of hog that would flood the market. such numbers would render local hog raisers incapable of competing especially with the threat of african swine flu. the government, thus, having lowered import tariffs effectively served them their death sentence. this country already failed to industrialize and now they want to kill industries that provide for food security. this is a country that when local products dwindle, they liberalize without support for recovery, expecting local industries to compete and magically become efficient. do you even think that with the recent rice tarrification law, rice production will recover even up to producing surplus? sa totoo lang, import if needed. but that has long been abused by the government, technocrats and foreigners that enter the market. we need efficient monitoring. kaso lang ang karamihan sa atin nakatuon lang sa presyo. sobrang tuwa natin kung mababa ang presyo dahil sa mga import, kahit pa at the expense of our agriculture and other local industries. magtataka pa ba tayo kung bakit wala na nagbabalak na pumasok sa agrikultura? napakasuperficial ng efforts ng pamahalaan na manghikayat ng kabataan na pumasok sa agrikultura eh pinapatay naman nila ang industriya. god forbid na kapag nagkagiyera, without food security even the capability to make bullets on our own, this land will fall to its knees. kawawang pilipinas. masyadong marami na ang baboy sa pamahalaan.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/mmj5vw/on_pork_imports_and_the_threat_to_hog_industry/,8 04 2021
I think I had CoVid and survived,"cause: week before i got sick i shared meals relatives who returned home from japan and singapore that could've been possible asyptomatic carriers. first day: i got sore throat but i had a late night milktea kasi so akala ko yun lang yung cause blurry kasi sick~ but i experienced body pain prolly after nung first meal with said relatives then simula nung sore throat, had fever then asthma na super lala for 5 days then i went in for check up na. i got myself checked then i was confined for a week. first time even after getting pneumonia twice before to be plugged with oxygen. i obviously got better enough to be released and then had a follow up check up and had meds prescribed. as of now i'm okay already but since i was not tested for covid19 and i experienced all the symptoms even vomitting i wonder if i had it and survived. p.s. simula pagkalabas ko i had all my family wearing masks na all the time + keep them stocked with alcohol in fear na they might bring it home to me,its been more than 14 days and no one showed signs naman with everyone who had close contact with me. throwaway because of the stigma and because i just want everyone to question the number of cases we have. if i might have really gone through it how many cases do you think go unreported? how many deaths are not counted and chalked up to pneumonia and asthma? edit: i received some hateful dms saying i lied at put people at risk...especially after a doctor died because someone lied..i didn't do it intentionally. i was upfront with my what happened to me during my check up and that i had relatives from japan and singapore. i was honest on the paper sheet the hospital makes everyone fill up which mostly just asked if i travelled to china or have close contact to wild animals. my doctor may have not been briefed to have cases like mine to be submitted for testing and i wasn't tested. while i feel bad for what i may have unintentionally done......blaming me for the shortcomings of doh and this government just made me feel glad i made a throwaway account. i have now called my barangay officials and explained my case they just suggested i self quarantine unless i have symptoms again. from now on i'll start eating my meals in my room and stay here for 14 days.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/fm11s9/i_think_i_had_covid_and_survived/,20 03 2020
Need help! Covid-19 Patient in PGH,"peeps, need your help. anyone here from pgh? tldr at the end. i just wanted to check, a relative was diagnosed as a covid-19 positive patient. as a precautionary measure, upon knowing the result we had the patient rushed to the hospital. currently, he is in pgh and is an ""blue"" color coded area. my questions are: 1. what is a blue coded area? does the color blue refer to the severity of one's case or just a simple color coding for ease of reference. from what i understood, the blue area is a ward wherein 10 patients are kept together. the patient is of senior age and has chronic disease. patient has no fever. vomits phlegm frequently (sorry tmi) he does not have the appetite to eat. patient can breathe by himself, though oxygen saturation is at 70s. oxygen is provided to him. burning sensation at the throat area (we think this is due from vomiting). 2. what are the chances for a covid-19 patient in pgh to be assigned a private room? is this possible? we wanted private room at least there will be less exposure to other patients. 3. how can we get updates about the patient? what pgh has told us is that someone from their end will call and update us. this makes us anxious. like how often are we going to get updates? daily? weekly? case to case? another option is to have someone wait within the confines of the hospital and personally ask the nurses station for update (which i think negates the principle of distancing yourself in covid hotspot areas). will it help if we know someone who works at pgh?! so far, we have no contacts yet but we're still asking around. if anyone knows or can help us on this regard, we will be forever indebted to you. thank you reddit fam and if it's not asking too much, a prayer, a thought for all the covid patients and caregivers' safety. please stay at home, kung lalabas make sure to take all precautionary measures habang asa labas at paguwi ng bahay. maigi ng labis ang pagiingat kesa sa kulang. tl;dr: a senior patient is rushed in pgh due to covid. wanted to know: 1) can a patient get a private bedroom? currently, he is in a ward with 10 patients. 2) how can we get frequent updates on the patient's status. nurse said we can go to pgh everytime we need an update or wait for them to inform us.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/hpynl1/need_help_covid19_patient_in_pgh/,12 07 2020

A Word from the Frontline,"warning: long post ahead due to context. i just got my license last october and opted for a year off. i was tired, i didn’t feel like i was ready for residency, and i definitely had plenty of personal issues that needed sorting out. let it not be said that med school is an ordeal in on itself. the boards were just the icing on the cake; and what a sour tasting icing it was. i digress. when i said “take a year off”, i simply mean that i wanted to stretch out on my own, finally do non med related things ive been keeping off the table for so long, and still keep sharp the skills and knowledge i’ve gained—yes, by working as a licensed physician. after all, a boy’s got to eat. serendipitous as it may seem, a few days after the announcement of the board passers, there was an opening in a public hospital near where i lived. the pay was considerable, the schedule (24 ++ hour duties notwithstanding) was alright and there was a chain of referral present. since it was a specialist hospital i (theoretically) did not need to worry about certain cases. while adulting was hard (literal na parang itatae kayo sa kalsada about the many intricacies of life that med school never bothered to even mention—unless you had a job before med), it was a minor irritation. lesson learned pa din and it definitely won’t do to be charged for tax evasion. the first few months were fun; if more hectic than i assumed it would be. the chain of command was surprisingly supportive unlike what was experienced by some of us during clerkship and/or internship. while i did my best, i still made a few mistakes—unsurprising as this was the first real time i’d be managing things on my own. not once was i lambasted nor abused, and for that i was grateful. constructive criticism and proper advise is so much better than the petty powertripping that seems so rampant in medicine—training or otherwise. skills remained sharp, i got to know great new people and explored my horizons both professional and personal in ways i don’t think residency would ever let me. call me pretentious, but maybe for some, it really is better to learn how to fly first before you walk. also, it really is something else to finally be earning for yourself and be able to give a bit in return to those who have supported you the whole time. all good things must come to an end; or as ned stark more fittingly put, “winter is coming.” come late december, everyone seemed to be happy, still so full of christmas cheer when there came news that in china, never-before-seen pathogen has begun infecting people. it didn’t seem like a big deal at the time, but it helped to keep tabs. soon enough, the virus we now call sars cov 2 which causes covid 19 was on the news everyday. soon, there were clamors to suspend flights to and from china and other affected areas. temporary naman, just until the crisis abates. i’m pretty sure a lot of you have seen the news on that last january-early feb. and then it started. at first, they were either foreign nationals here for a vacation or for whatever other purpose or ofws, having come from a high risk country with fever, cough and/or colds. fever, cough and/or colds. as simple as they may sound, the sheer number of pathogenic entities that can cause any or all of these is simply mind-boggling. this is where history-taking and physical examination comes in. it was often said that 95% of the time, a doctor can get it right simply through those. lies kill, and we would learn how true those words are in due time. going back, the lab exams, radiologic imaging etc are there not to diagnose for us, but to act as supporting evidence. they serve to identify what the pathogen is (for us to give specific treatment if need be), to see if the patient is getting better (hence repeat testing for a lot of illnesses), and to see if there is anything new needs to be addressed. that’s the remaining 5%. so yeah, it was a trickle at first. manageable. or so it seemed. that trickle soon turned into a stream; regular hospital protocol simply wouldn’t do anymore so the admin made drastic changes. effectively, the hospital i worked in became a specialty center for covid 19 with those changes. our job? the vanguard. the frontline. before anyone thinks it’s unfair and too risky, our seniors had the far riskier job of actually handling the day-to-day issues of inpatients including those who have turned out positive. we adjusted. we made our pleas for compensation heard, and at the very least we were given what was due. hopefully, that fairness stays that way for the duration. having done my internship in the biggest public hospital myself, the eventual frontline seemed a familiar sight. the major difference was the fear. fear spreads faster and goes deeper than any other plague can. it started with that report about the first locally transmitted case of covid 19. suddenly the people came non-stop, some outright demanding to be tested despite being told and being shown the guidelines that we follow. to placate such people is a balancing act in being professional and in keeping one’s temper down. it is immensely tiring for mind, body and spirit to do so on a repeated basis. as of right now, the most at risk seem to still be the old and/or those with debilitating chronic illnesses. they are the ones who should be tested and admitted if need be. there are no guidelines for vip testing. god forbid the day there would be. we had to swallow the bile, seeing the pompous and entitled put themselves first before the people they had sworn to serve. heck, ‘til now, none of the medical staff in the hospital have ever been swabbed. the reality that we and the other staff members were but lowly ants that can only serve and not be heard (at least not out loud) was not missed. even our seniors who had a negative opinion on the matter had no choice. rizal once stated it so graciously in the character of kabesang tales and the friars who deigned on his rights and what he knew was just. “siya ang palayok, kawali ang korporasyon.” go figure. that stream soon turned into a river; more changes were wrought in our line of work. more struggles. more. more. more. our seniors had to pull off alternating shifts; that is to say they go on 24++ hour duties every other day, supposedly to keep their immunities up. it does little to lessen the risk of their contracting the virus which by that point had caused all of luzon to be locked down by the increasingly erratic president. most of us juniors couldn’t risk going home. our parents were and continue to be at risk. they are getting on with years and if they were to get sick, then science—objective and simultaneously emotionless—dictated that they were most likely to suffer severe manifestations. the communities where we come home too will also suffer thanks to the draconian measures we are all forced to live with. at the very least, the hospital admin gave us lodging and food, and we are grateful for the good samaritans who have and continue to help out in what ways they can. i cannot say the same for other healthcare workers from other institutions. each day brings more patients, and each day the atmosphere becomes more rife with fear or so it seems. the number of cases is rising daily. the risk of contracting the disease (or any such similar ones) is a constant companion especially for we who actually have to handle patients. the risk is probably similar too for any such patient who decides to get checked in our now-densely packed institutions by simple proximity. remember; droplet transmission has an effective radius of 6 feet. one cough. one sneeze. a lot of people. that’s all it would take. outside the hospital, the news still leaves a lot to the imagination, but what is shown seems to reflect a similar condition. it’s morbidly interesting how a virus is all it would take to lay bare the many, many faults and inadequacies of the system we follow and are forced to endure. rather than lead with a sense of gravity and purpose, we get sad excuses, senseless statements (e.g. “the kit”) and many such other examples. instead of a medical solution, we get a militaristic one. hell, a lot of these soldiers probably don’t have adequate training (if at all) for an epidemic. the masks most of them wear are about as useful as tissue paper against sars cov 2. one can hardly blame them for that kind of ignorance at least. it is the possibility of abuse of power that keeps heads turning and fingers crossed. such abuse has happened before after all, lest we forget. what is incredible is that some people have the gall to defend these measures without being offered enough aid nor explanation. instead “ano bakit? may naiambag ka ba? sumunod ka na lang kasi <expletive>” has become a de facto reason if you can even call it that. i digress again. the frontline sees us and our fellow healthcare workers exposed in more ways than one. i am lucky that our institution seems to have enough for our staff which number few to begin with. we make do with what limited manpower we have because we don’t have a choice. for the larger institutions (public and private), i’ve seen and heard from friends also on the frontline how they have to improvise simply due to a shortage of stocks that those in power are supposed to provide. manpower too is fast becoming a problem; even old doctors and nurses who shouldn’t pull such long shifts anymore are forced to take the field despite the higher risk they have due to the curse of age. the virus (and the menagerie of other microbes in the workplace) is not the only thing we are exposed to; healthcare workers have to grind too for a living, just like anyone else. work from home is never an option. imagine during the first few days of the lockdown, not a single fig it seemed was given regarding the problem of commuting to and from the workplace or alternatively where they can stay to limit exposure. contrary to what most think, nobody gets rich by working in healthcare alone. most of us don’t have cars too. before the present transpo measures were placed, each institution had to think of ways on how to manage an otherwise crippling problem. sari-sariling diskarte in other words. imagine that. it’s even more harrowing now to know some of these healthcare workers have been thrown out like the lepers of old by paranoid landlords who consider them harbingers of disease. mind you, healthcare workers are among those supposed to have a pass to go to and from their place of work for obvious reasons. we have a hard enough time with what’s going on. misinformation and paranoia only make it more difficult and dangerous for everyone. what more for the common filipino who holds no exemption? i’ve felt helpless whenever a patient has asked me how they’re supposed to go home or to pay for private services. i have no true answer nor remedy for that. compound those with the previously existing problems we have in our healthcare system. most, if not all of us, have families; and the possibility of never seeing them again is always around the corner. as i write this, a total of 10 doctors, most of whom had been in the high risk age group, have perished due to covid 19. it is a reminder of mortality; a reminder that not everyone can be saved. forget that a lot of frontliners are relatively young. we die too. the ones in charge of running the country, flaccid as they are, seem to think that the death of one is a tragedy, the death of a million is a statistic. i do hope i am proven wrong in that regard. the personal toll is no less painful, perhaps even moreso; for patients and those whose lives have been forfeit, most of all. there are dreams now that may never be realized, loves that may never again come alive. there are roads in life closed mayhaps forever; not just for we in the vanguard, but for anyone who holds such hopes. it makes one think of what could have been avoided simply by imposing those would-be travel bans. alas, it appears that we have been in damage control ever since. while we (healthcare workers—no, mr. cayetano, sit down) stand united in trying to stem the torrent, it is unsurprising and most unfortunate that even we are bickering and arguing about what to do next. then again, we’re people too. we have flaws too. i’ve said previously, we die too. there are at least ten names now that can attest to that. we are also afraid. but we can’t choose to show that. we want answers from above, same as everyone. when we make ourselves heard, there are consequences that follow. many such answers given too are not all assuring and leaves many a question to boil in a fevered mind. forgive the comparison, but some of us do feel like soldiers being made to go to war without arms. we can only hope that everyone does their part. is this a war we can win?

COVID-19 experience and how the LGU handled it.,"3 weeks ago my parents were positive for covid-19. the reason why? my mom went to our relatives across town to take care of my lola who asked for her to stay the night. my mom said my tita there was coughing and had fever, she asked for her to get tested. the next day my mom went home, cooked for us and basically had direct contact with the whole fam. before going to bed my parents received a call that my tita was positive for the antigen test. we asked the lgu to mass test everyone in that household but they refused and only swabbed my tita because she only had the symptoms. it also took 5 days before they got the result. i isolated my mom for that 5 days hoping my tita was negative but sadly she wasn’t. on that same day we found out she was positive we asked a private laboratory approved by the doh to swab us at home and also my relatives who were living with my tita. turns out 7/10 of my relatives living with my tita were positive including my pregnant cousin, my lola, my tita with autism and my 4 yr old nephew and 2/5 were positive in our home i was so devastated because my mom has asthma and hypertension while my dad has type 2 diabetes. thankfully my mom was asymptomatic and my dad only had mild symptoms. yes they took human grade ivermectin prescribed by a physician and it really helped. i was already drinking vitamins c, zinc and omega-3 ever since pandemic started maybe that’s why i had a strong immune system and didn’t get the virus even though i had direct contact with my parents all throughout the quarantine. i had to check their vitals everyday. i am sharing my experience because the largest cases of transmission is through household transmission and still the gov’t keeps locking us up in our houses. the implementation of lockdowns, faceshields, transportation suspensions, curfews and restrictions in public places pushed the filipino people to remove every protective gears they have once they step inside the comfort of their homes because the outside implementations are too much to handle. not to mention no healthcare worker visited us for the whole quarantine. my parents could basically just walk out, i almost tied my father inside because he keeps setting up appointments and errands during quarantine and if i wasn’t there he would’ve went out. on the 10th day of quarantine the brgy nurse contacted me and asked how we were and said that if we were feeling okay they will assign us as recovered on that same day. i asked the nurse if we will undergo swab test before we were assigned as recovered and they told me “if asymptomatic na po hindi na sila isswab.” i told them my mom was asymptomatic on the very first day of quarantine but still she tested positive. the nurse asked how my mom was swabbed if she was asymptomatic, i told them we hired a private lab to swab us at home since the lgu is not providing it to us. the swab costs 3,200 each for rt-pcr testing. we got swabbed after two weeks of quarantine by the same private laboratory and now all of us are negative. imagine if we didn’t have the money for swab tests, my relatives and parents would have been roaming free spreading covid just because the gov’t refused to swab them as they were asymptomatic. imagine if my parents didn’t have access to human grade ivermectin or vitamins then my parents with comorbidities would’ve faced severe symptoms. am i the only one seeing something wrong with how the gov’t is handling this pandemic? it’s frustrating that you can’t do anything about it, more people are suffering it’s been more than a year and it’s becoming a cycle. if anyone here is from the gov’t please implement mass testing more contact tracing and remove the freaggin face shields my eye glasses won’t fit with it and bikers are getting in accidents because of it, just tell everyone to use medical grade face masks instead. please i don’t want another year taken away from our lives.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/mpd6ot/covid19_experience_and_how_the_lgu_handled_it/,12 04 2021

Nakita ko na ata yung destiny ko. (long read),"i posted here kasi d ako makapagshare sa iba kasi i dont wanna jinx anything lol. this story will sound a bit crazy, but believe me, every bit of it is true. i think eto na ata yung sinasabi nilang destiny. this is a long story, so brace yourselves. (for context, i'm a straight male, so babae yung ""destiny"" in the story hehe) august 2018. nag iinuman kami ng mga kaibigan ko sa labas ng isang convenience store isang gabi. ran out of emperador so pumasok ako para bumili pa. mejo tipsy na rin ako nun, pero pagtingin ko sa mga table sa loob, nakita ko sya. tangina ang ganda. nagtatawanan sila ng mga kaibigan nya. mejo natulala ako sa kanya kay d ko namalayan ako na pala ung magbabayad sa may cashier. nagbayad lang ako saglit, paglingon ko, wala na sila dun. umalis na ata. sabi ko sa sarili ko ""sayang, sino kaya yun?"" tapos bumalik na ako sa pwesto namin. i forgot about her. but then i saw her again. january 2019. bumibili ako ng jeans sa penshoppe, nang pumasok isang grupo ng mga pre med students na naka uniform. nung tumingin ako ulit sa grupo, i couldn't believe it. nandum sya! hmm so pre med student pala sya sa *****. pumunta ako sa fitting room, paglabas ko nawala nanaman siya. umalis na ata. akala ko d na masusundan yun. boy was i wrong. march 2019. i was down with a fever, so nakahiga lang ako, nagffacebook. then, i saw her again. nasa suggested friends. so yun pala pangalan nya. ang ganda. inadd ko kaagad, at inaccept naman nya hehehe. but d ako manyak kaya d ko sya chinat. d naman din sapat yung reasons ko para i chat sya (at creepy kaya yun kung sabihin kong nagkita na kami). so i was just happy na inaccept nya request ko at sa wagas alam ko na pangalan nya. but d pala doon nagtatapos. about a week after, nasa bangko ako, nagbabayad. nung nakita ko yung teller, naisip ko parang magkamukha sila. tapos naisip ko rin na, ""kailan ko kaya sya makikita ulit?"". mukhang nasagot agad yung tanong ko kasi saktong sakto paglabas ko, dumaan sya sa harapan ko. i couldn't fucking believe it! tangina good mood kaagad ako. nung bumalik ako ng school after a few minutes, nakwento ko sa isa kong classmate yung about sa nangyari. pabirong sinaabi nya ""pag magkita pa kayo ulit, destiny na yan"". holy fuck. kahit ako d makapaniwala kasi nung papunta ako sa next class ko, nag stop over ako sa water fountain malapit sa gate. tangina pagtingin ko siya nanaman! wtfff. ba't andito sya sa university na pinapasukan ko kasama mga friends nya? (turns out they were visiting someone i think). i was in so much disbelief. i went to class thinking na, i think i've had enough good luck today. but nope, i saw her again. after the two hour class, kakain muna sana ako ng isaw bago umuwi, nung pagtingin ko, nandun siya sa may isawan. tangina tadhana na talaga to. december 2019. didn't see her again for a while, pero nung pauwi na ako, isang gabi nakasabay ko sya sa jeep. d ko muna napansin at first, pero nung narealize ko, sya pala yung nasa harapan ko. tangina ang ganda parin nya. parang may sign. sabi ko sa sarili ko, ""sigurado ako mauuna naman sya sa pagbaba kasi yung subdivision namin malayo layo na din from city proper, kaunti nalang usually kasabay ko pagdating dun"". tangina nauna pa akong bumaba. papunta pala sya sa xmas party ata yun ng victory malapit sa may airport (saw her pics few days after sa fb). what would be your opinion guys? should i gather the courage na magpakilala sa kanya? should i write a book about this? hahahaha i need your thoughts. thank you!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/fa9f7k/nakita_ko_na_ata_yung_destiny_ko_long_read/,27 02 2020

The special ̶p̶o̶w̶e̶r̶s̶ ̶o̶f̶ ̶ Koko Pimentel,"by his own admission, he was on self-quarantine: “i quarantined myself since march 11, 2020, and already tried to limit my movements.” his wife’s own words: “he had been in quarantine for weeks in a separate bedroom.” (n.b. “for weeks”) let’s be somber and check how the koko pimentel's fare vis-à-vis the following filipinos in similar circumstances: a 60-year-old man in caloocan died last saturday because the injudiciously planned lockdown prevented him from getting transport to his dialysis sessions. his thrice-weekly dialysis was his only chance to live a productive life, but he had lost access to the treatment. in just a week of lockdown, his body had bloated. he died of kidney failure. ~~but for koko and his wife, they had the privilege to forum-shop for hospitals. denied at one hospital, they proceeded to makati medical center.~~ the brothers gerald and mark libiran are both in the health care frontlines. gerald is an aide at the philippine orthopedic center who works 10 hours a day, three times a week. mark, his brother, works at the national children’s hospital where he had just completed four days straight duty. the brothers were on a motorcycle to take the two-hour ride to their santa maria, bulacan home. with no public conveyances, that was their only way to reach home and rest for the next hospital duty. they were flagged down for violating the prohibition on back rides, despite showing work identification cards. “my heart sunk when i learned that the penalty was p5,000. that’s half of my salary for the month,” said gerald. ~~but for the pimentels, the license plates of a senator’s car facilitate ease of entry, plus other support vehicles for bodyguards.~~ the 69-year-old homeless dorothy espejo sleeps on the pavements of malate. she was apprehended by law enforcers, booked at the police station for a mug shot and charged with resistance to authority. but to where could a destitute itinerant have gone home? a home for dorothy is the government’s solution. ~~the arresting police instead told her they needed to set an example. yet for koko, the justice secretary was quick to say, “the doj will temper the rigor of the law with human compassion.”~~ koko said his self-quarantine started march 11, the last day of the senate sessions. we all know the senate became pestilent after a committee hearing resource person had later tested positive. we go by his own account that led to his self-quarantine: march 14 he started having body pains and flu symptoms; he then slept in a room separate from his wife; march 18 he had a 38-degree fever and sore throat. he was correct for following the protocol that as a person under monitoring (he came from a risk area, he manifested the symptoms), self-quarantine was required. let’s be redundant to take his word for it: he tried to limit his movements and slept in a separate bedroom. on march 16, five days after his self-imposed quarantine, he went shopping ~~at the membership club s&r at bonifacio global city. he checked out at counter 13 at 1:59 p.m. he breached his home quarantine protocol. he lied.~~ cctv cameras did not. grocery workers are frontliners, too, for being at the receiving end of viral risk. when koko’s test came out on march 24, s&r bgc had to quarantine those within contagious distance of the ~~self-quarantined-but-lied~~ former senate president. the homeless dorothy espejo is in jail but not koko ~~who did not use his kokote~~. dr. israel bactol and others who succumbed but got their positive test results only after they had died is not pardonable ~~when the marcos family got theirs in only a day~~. in a pandemic of chasm between the rich and the poor, the defenseless perish first. ~~koko pimentel and a government with no compulsion to protect its citizens have just prescribed the recipe for mass panic and mass contagion. bong go can go breach the metro manila quarantine again when a fire breaks out in another city like he did in butuan city~~. ~~mediocrities of haughty entitlements and militarism to solve a medical crisis?~~ strikethrough all vip entitlements. &#x200b; written by: **by:** [antonio montalvan ii](https://twitter.com/antoniojmontal2?s=20)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/frzete/the_special_powers_of_koko_pimentel/,30 03 2020
BBM's first 100 days (Long read),"q: how would you grade the first 100 days of pres marcos? a: i would do what i've done with every president. first, i will ask what did he inherit from his predecessor? then i will compare what he has done in his first 100 with his inheritance to what his predecessor did with his in his first 100 days. the first 100 are first steps in a six year journey so they are merely an indicator of where the president will be taking us - up a hill or over a cliff? there will be course corrections (or maybe none) as the journey moves forward or backward as the case may be. that's why i believe the first 100 is a mere indicator of where the president might take us. having said that, let me share what i felt during the first 100 days of previous presidents starting with gma. (i was living abroad during the entire term of cory and the first 2 years of fvr so i can't compare fvr's first 100 to cory's nor erap's first 100 to fvr's.) gma's first 100 made me happy and relieved and her second first 100 in 2004 made me feel the exact opposite. but looking back, i've realized the alternative in 2004 would have been a first 100 for fpj who made movies difficult to watch for even 100 seconds. and after she took her oath in 2004, her successor would have been noli de castro. in short, the alternatives could have been really disastrous. pnoy gave me the same happiness and relief i felt during gma's original first 100 and for the most part that feeling stayed with me for six years. there were a few disappointments here and there, nobody's perfect, but overall he didn't make me feel let down. my optimism remained high all throughout his presidency. duterte's first 100 were unbearable and so were the rest of his remaining 2090 days as president. bloody corpses in depressed areas, embarrassing and cringey appearances on both world and domestic stages, corruption so unbridled that not even a pandemic could slow it down, total destruction of institutions of checks and balance vital for the survival of democracy and the rule of law. and i'm just getting started so let's leave it at that. and now pres bbm. first i'll be honest. i was very disappointed leni lost and fearful bbm would become another duterte. but it is what it is so let's move on and compare his first 100 to duterte's first 100. pres bbm made some good appointments and some awful ones - calida (glad he didn't last 100 days), enrile, bersamin, and sara to name the worst choices for vital positions. and he also neglected a vital appointment. up to now, he has not appointed a health secretary despite his having extended the covid public health emergency until december. he radically departed from duterte on matters most important to duterte: 1) he met with biden to recalibrate our bilateral relations and by so doing tempered duterte's fevered romance with xi jin ping, 2) he shared a well thought out reservation about bringing back the death penalty, and, in the greatest departure of all, 3) announced a drug war policy that would focus on stemming supply i.e. go after big time drug smugglers and dealers instead of the little guys whose corpses duterte loved to use as props for his war on drugs. further he will focus on educating the youth on the dangers of drug abuse and he will undertake the rehabilitation of addicts. (similar to leni's humane approach on drugs) so, barring any course corrections, his war on drugs will definitely be humane and rational compared to his predecessor's which was barbaric and insane. i fully support bbm's position on the death penalty and the war on drugs. there are opportunities he must not let pass in the coming 2090 days, opportunities that will allow history to judge him on his own merits rather than as marcos junior: 1) the assassination of radio commentator lapid must be solved with both the assassins and mastermind(s) brought to justice asap. one does not have to ennumerate what bringing those involved in that murder will do to put meat on his pronouncements regarding his commitment to human rights, press freedom, the rule of law and his abhorrence for violence and criminality. related to this would be strengthening the commission on human rights with legislation and certifying as urgent the enactment of the freedom of information bill. 2) he must appoint the right person to chair the coa. that will correct the bad impression created when he appointed calida, a duterte stooge who raised eyebrows in coa over contracts his family-owned security agency entered into with several govt agencies including congress while he was solgen. pres bbm must appoint a coa chair who will lay to rest any doubts about his stated commitment to clean and honest governance. related to appointing an uncompromising coa chair, the successful prosecution of crooked govt officials will happen only if ombudsman samuel martires is replaced. martires can only be removed through impeachment but he can be persuaded to resign. pres bbm must also certify as urgent those necessary amendments to the bank secrecy law and amendments that will make the anti-money laundering agency more effective. 3) set the example for other branches of gov't, i.e. congress, judiciary, and constitutional bodies by issuing an order mandating that all salns of executive branch employees be posted online. goverment works best when given the right working conditions. as vp leni never tired of reminding us, ""sa gobyernong tapat, aangat tayong lahat."" 🙂 finally, beware of optics in a society that suffers from a huge wealth disparity. pnoy was attacked by his own dilawans when he bought a used porsche with his own money. he ended up having to sell it immediately. one does not have to sleep under a kulambo, eat with his hands in a carenderia, and wear a kamiseta although it will be good to keep in mind that those antics produced a net satisfaction rating of 81% for one president.🤣🤣",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/xwyki7/bbms_first_100_days_long_read/,6 10 2022

Day 1 of Self Quarantine,"for all those who are currentlly working, i advice you to stay healthy, not only because its essential, but because being sick in this dilemna would cause you so much trouble more than you can imagine. &#x200b; (this is just a throwaway account) &#x200b; i work at the back office team at a bpo company. i am one of those who opted to stay at the place where i work before the ecq started so that travel wouldn't be an issue, and i will be able to provide income for my family in the middle of this crisis. &#x200b; &#x200b; this thursday, i felt very cold, so i went to our company's clinic.turns out i'm feverish. when i was asked what might be the cause, i told them i took a bath without sleep as the comfort room is crowded in the morning, and it's almost next to impossible to have a bath, so i thought it would be better if i took a shower after my shift before going to sleep. &#x200b; because of the protocol and the current ecq, i was advised to go home as i need to self quarantine myself for 2 weeks, which i took because there's no quarantine facility where i work, even though i'm only feverish. i was fetched by the company's private vehicle and took me home. now the bad thing starts from here. &#x200b; what i rode is a van, but because of ""concerned citizens"" who saw me on my way home, they mistook it and reported and spread to other neighbors that i rode an \*ambulance vehicle\* instead. i chose to ignore it, then the worst thing happened. &#x200b; come this afternoon of friday, all of the passages that leads to our home inside and out has been blocked by either water drums,sack of garbages, a wooden ladder or a metal rooftop. we felt very harassed, or should i say, we were harassed. we can see barangay officials (""tanods"") watching us from afar, observing us if we ever left our house. the front our house was sprayed by an disinfectant. that was fine, i can accept that, but the fact that thy still leave it blocked until evening left us very angry and offended. it took a shouting of my mother to all of our neighbors just to remove all of the things that blocks the passages to and from our home, she was crying, because we're not infected with covid, i just became feverish so i needed to be sent to home. and even though all the passage blocks have been removed, the officials of our barangay called my mother and told her that she was not allowed to go outside and advised that instead give it to the officials in the checkpoint and let them buy from her. but my mother can't accept it because not only she wants to buy her own food, even though we were pleading to just allow my mother to be able to go outside, they're not allowing it. as we are all pums right now. &#x200b; i talked to the barangay official and pleaded again if, for the last time, just let my mother go outside as she has quarantine pass and she is obeying the protocol and disinfecting herself and all, but they said they can't allow it. i told them it's not really in me who also has the final decision, but my mother too. they told me that if we continue to persist and be stubborn, i won't be able to get a certificate from the barangay that indicated that i'm fit to work. that was the worst part. because i'm the one who is providing for my family. our father left us because he got tired of fulfilling obligations, and it's only me and my mother that are doing our best everyday to support my younger brother, who i hoped someday he can be someone who can finish college, unlike me who was an undergrad and needed to stop because i haveto support them instead of our mother the only one supporting the both of us. i don't know if its the right way to describe it, but i felt like my job was put on the line because i just had a fever. fine, harrassment is something that can be punish by law, but that's beyond our capabilities, and we don't want to enter that teritorry. we're just a little family barely scraping by to be able to live through tomorrow. &#x200b; i don't know if i'm entitled to be right. someone might just that, ""you need to obey it"", but no, it does not come that easy, the damage was already done, and it was massive. it wouldn't be much of an exagaration if you can call me a crybaby right now. &#x200b; i just wanted to share this, and i know i'm not the only one who experienced this kind of situation. &#x200b; i want you to know that it's not just the virus that is our enemy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/fydz17/day_1_of_self_quarantine/,10 04 2020
Update on Nala my Maltichon,"for anyone else wondering here's my previous post about her: [help me raise 8k php for my dog nala](https://www.reddit.com/r/philippines/comments/gn1qjm/please_help_me_raise_php_8k_for_my_dog_nala_for/) *we succesfully gathered around php 3k with all your help and i'm really glad and amazed what you people can do for a stranger's dog. maraming salamat po! sincerely from me.* so i'm posting this update para sa mga redditors na nag follow kay nala especially sa mga nag donate. **may 22:** around 2 days after i posted a cry for help sa r/philippines nala isn't getting any better, kumakain pa din may gana pero hindi na ganun kalakas kagaya dati. but thursday night hindi siya kumain which is hindi naman nakakabahala, unfortunately morning to tanghali ayaw niya pa rin kumain so i tried carrying her and kinakausap ko siya but she's not responding. nabahala ako so tinry ko siya itayo para maglakad lakad pero bumabagsak lang siya ulit, nagpanic na ako so i called his original vet if he could help. i know it's a reach kasi ecq pa pero makakapunta daw siya hintayin ko daw siya sa bahay. when he arrived he told me to rush nala sa clinic nila (his original vet clinic) so nalaman ko nagbukas na pala sila around 2nd week of may. sinugod namin si nala sa furry friends sa caloocan and luckily siya lang ang patient non. they told me na grabe na yung damage sa skin niya and saw na baka may maggots yung paws na niya. they also told me that amputation is possible kapag unrepairable na or nabubulok na sugat niya especially sa paws at sa tail. masyado dinb daw manipis balat ni nala and napakadaming flakes na nagfafall off from her body kaya siya nangangati. &#x200b; [at furry friends clinic](https://preview.redd.it/saqrwsbx70251.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9443944503ec0cdd2041bd25de98691f5de3085b) i decided to skin scrape and cbc her. never pa siya na cbc, so ayun ang goal ko kasi hindi ko alam bakit hindi pa siya gumagaling since march. sa skin scrape nakita na meron siyang demodex (hindi ko po alam spelling) pero its an insect that causes itchyness and galis. she's positive for mange. the problem is usually marami na daw yung 1 to 2 na insect sa isang skin scrape pero sa kanya 12 (take note na hindi pa yun sa sugat kumuha) which indicates na sobrang abnormal na ng dami nung parasites. &#x200b; [shivers and cleaning ng sugat niya](https://preview.redd.it/eewwtclz70251.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=47d84285281125ed50cf12986e72905fba1b77b2) they told me this is caused by stress. dapat daw na cocontrol ng immune system niya yung pagdami nun kaso dahil na stress siya most probably because of the grooming kasi dun nagsimula siya mangati, sobrang dumami yung demodex. they even showed me what's on the microscope. nakakalungkot isipin na dahil lang sa simpleng grooming nagkaganyan na yung dating healthy na siya. cbc came out and they saw an abnormality sa mga components. may bacterial infection siya kaya bumababa ata ang hemoglobin niya hindi ko gaanong sure. while we were discussing, nala started to shiver and the doctor said na kinokombulsyon siya kasi 40 degrees yung temperature niya. &#x200b; [sorry nabura na yung cbc na naka attach, i also lost the computation how much it costs but naka php 3200 ako, she has around 6 na iniintake and a spray, plus the three injections.](https://preview.redd.it/z82q4n1380251.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9adfcdb1977fff2d30706a925e9023975745cb67) &#x200b; https://preview.redd.it/50ji08fa80251.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bea67e1d3f2a8d1a55a0fcf680fe2d1c326b73b0 they cleaned her sugat. and injected her three times. yung dalawa anti mange/anti parasite and yung isa for her fever. they told me na this will be a 6 week long na gamutan and babalik kami dun every friday starting 22. i agreed. they also told me to stop seeking for convenia because it'll be too costly and hindi sure na gagana, at least eto daw proven, they told me to make nala sa comfortable as possible to reduce her stress. bumalik na kami last friday and the doctors said na shes getting better albeit she lost .4 kg. pinalitan na din namin diet niya to reflex pero hindi niya gaanong kinakain. she's still weak, barely walking but nakakalakad na at least. the first 3 days din from 22 kamot siya ng kamot as in walang tigil kaya nakaka stress pero since monday she stopped itching na. nagtatanggalan na langib niya din. &#x200b; [her favorite spot on my chair](https://preview.redd.it/evaj95l190251.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=575df5eb0c79a5f0e8595cdfc248329bbbb63014) &#x200b; &#x200b; [latest pic, hindi na reddish skin niya and nagtatanggalan na scabs niya.](https://preview.redd.it/lpfmo7t390251.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4cbf0b6cdff492d9a6045c04268ec1345d1f9533) i**'m here to post this update to thank you guys for the support.** masakit man, pero kelangan ko kayo because some of my family members think na sayang lang ang pera sa kanya at ipamigay na lang daw namin tapos bumili na lang kami ng aso. i had arguments with my family because of this. maraming salamat po, she's recovering slowly pero hindi namin siya titigilan hanggang sa hindi siya gumagaling! **donations are still welcome, sobrang maappreciate namin yung donation because i barely have anything left.** 6 weeks na gamutan pa siya and every week may injection sa kanya. i hope na you guys are still willing to donate to an anonymous stranger and his dog. *if you are willing to donate please drop me a dm. pwede na din po bank kasi nakausap ko na gf ko and she lent me her bank account for donations.* ***please dm me for account # or gcash.*** &#x200b; thank you so much!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/gtqe7f/update_on_nala_my_maltichon/,31 05 2020

Need help diagnosing sickness!,"hi r/philippines! i am feeling quite sick and doctors haven't been able to provide any help. i am an american who spent about two weeks in the philippines in june/july. i was out in a more rural area for a little less than a week in antique on panay. then i was at borocay for a few days and then manila for a brief time. i ate lots of food i've never seen before including balut, vampire stew, and more. i felt fine the whole trip. two days after returning (almost a month ago now) i become very sick. i had a high fever, a terrible headache, loss of appetite, insomnia, and a swollen throat. it lasted for about 5 days. it was probably the most sick i've ever been. after that i felt completely fine. i tested negative for covid and influenza. 2 or 3 weeks later now, i am sick again but with some different symptoms. i have a slight headache, a swollen throat, i have no appetite and occasionally feel sick at the sight of food (haven't thrown up yet), and i feel incredibly cold. the opposite of a fever, i think my body temperature has actually decreased and i sometimes feel freezing. this has been going on for 6 days now. doctors here do not seem to recognize what this could be. i feel incredibly anxious because i've never felt sick like this. any ideas? i had a great time visiting otherwise. thank you !",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/15n811q/need_help_diagnosing_sickness/,10 08 2023

3 parts: **part 1. how to find a reliable freight forwarder?** * ***why do you need a freight forwarder, and what can they do for you?*** a freight forwarder is an experienced person or a company from the international trade and transport community that coordinates and ships goods from one place to another by different modes of transportation. when you want to ship by yourself or when you have a hard time trying to find a reliable business partner, a freight forwarder is the best option because he will help you find solutions for shipping from china to the philippines. if you are an occasional carrier who knows little about international transport, we also recommend you find a cargo agent who will be able to help you in this complex process. in other words, if you want to save time, energy and money while making an international delivery from china to the philippines by air, sea or land, consider using a freight forwarding agent; he will make sure your goods will arrive on time and at the final destination in the right conditions. if you don’t have enough time and energy to go by yourself along this complex process, having a freight forwarder would make a great difference. they have experience in this industry which they’ll use to your advantage to reduce costs and help you find solutions to any transportation problems, and you will be able to save more time and money than if you ship by yourself. * ***should i choose a freight forwarder from china or the philippines?*** when you’re importing goods from china, it is always best to choose a freight forwarder from there, regardless of the mode of transportation. the chinese freight forwarders are the best option for overseas transporters because they have the advantage of language and geography, and you will also need a warehouse for storage and preparation. an experienced chinese freight forwarder will have these abilities: he will be fluent in mandarin and cantonese; he will have a thorough knowledge of the chinese business culture, experience in managing chinese suppliers, category and sourcing process experience, quality control experience, audit experience, and logistics experience. in general, the local forwarders (from the philippines) will often have to contact another agent in china to handle the picking, preparation, storage, and customs clearance. * ***how reliable is a freight forwarder?*** a freight forwarder is a reliable and experienced agent who will help you find solutions for shipping from china to the philippines. but to be sure they provide what you need, you can ask them a couple of questions to assess whether they are qualified for your transportation or not. time, money, and the success of your shipment from china to the philippines are what matter. 1) does the freight forwarder have a business license from the chinese government? – having a business license makes everything legal and transparent for you. 2) does the company have a good insurance plan? – having a good insurance plan is very important because it will compensate for your merchandise if any damage occurs in shipment or warehousing. 3) do they have a complete cargo tracking system to update your cargo progress in real-time? – finding a cargo shipping partner that offers cargo tracking is crucial because you can see in real-time where your shipping is and how much it takes to arrive at the final destination. 4) you can also ask them to provide the most recent shipment record or bill of lading – a bill of lading contains all relevant details about the type, amount, condition, and destination of the goods. 5) during the consultation, were the responses prompt, with professional advice and explanations? – if you are convinced by their services, but you still have some doubts about the process, it is best to try the freight forwarder with a shipment of small goods; this way, if anything goes wrong, you won’t lose a big amount of money. **part 2. how many modes of transportation are there from china to the philippines?** before talking about the modes of transportation is good to know what standards and regulations apply in the philippines, and also which are restricted and prohibited goods. • import rules, regulations, and customs in the philippines the documents required for importing goods into the philippines are a packing list, invoice, bill of lading; import permit; customs import declaration, and certificate of origin. goods that would harm national security, public safety and order, and morality, are considered restricted and prohibited. these include: used clothing and rags, guns, right-hand drive vehicles, laundry and industrial detergents containing hard surfactants, used motorcycle parts, except engine, live piranha, shrimp, and prawns, dynamite and gun powder, obscene articles and printings, drugs, and so on. certain goods such as wood, plants, live animals and animal by-products, fishery and aquatic products, etc. need special licenses and permits from different authorities in order to import into the philippines. some of the goods are absolutely prohibited and other certain goods can be imported under a license or permit. the top 10 imported goods into the philippines in 2018 were: electrical machinery and equipment, mineral fuels including oil, machinery including computers, vehicles, iron and steel, plastics, aircraft, cereals, articles of iron or steel, optical, technical, medical apparatus. the mode of transportation is an important aspect and has to be evaluated when you’re planning the shipment (costs, shipment urgency, the value of the goods, and the size and weight of the package). depending on your load volume, it is best to evaluate the mode of transportation when planning the shipment process because each option of transport has advantages and disadvantages. you can significantly optimize your cargo flow and save money and time by choosing the right mode of transportation. after you have selected your cargo agent, the collaboration between the two parts will begin. an experienced china-philippines freight expert will have excellent communication skills and understand all your requirements, including time, budget, and mode of transportation. in other words, when you are planning your shipment, you have to prioritize your needs, understand the process, and compare costs. by choosing the right mode of transportation, you can significantly optimize your cargo flow. * ***express delivery from china to the philippines:*** it is a known fact that 95% of product samples and a small amount of high-value goods are sent by courier worldwide. if you have an urgent and quick delivery to make, express shipping is the best option because is a relatively easy way to transport goods, and it takes, in general, 2 – 5 business days to reach your doorstep. express delivery is suitable for goods that are less than one cubic meter or 200 kilograms. the delivery time from china to the philippines by courier service (fedex, ups, dhl, and tnt) is around 3 business days. the prices and rates for express delivery are higher than other forms of transportation. also, the cost of express shipping may increase during the holidays. to save money, cargo agents or freight forwarders are the best solutions because they can find you an express company that gives you a reasonable price, and they can also get a discount price that you won’t find on their official website. * ***sea shipping from china to the philippines:*** sea shipping is suitable in general for loads over 500 kilograms or when the size of the products occupies more than two cubic meters. however, it is also the most complicated mode of transportation, and it takes a long time, but sometimes this might be the only option. from china to the philippines, sea shipping time, in general, is estimated at around 10 to 20 days from port to port. in china, there are several ports such as shanghai port, ningbo port, shenzhen port, tianjin port, qingdao port, xiamen port, beijing port, and hong kong port, from which your shipping can leave to the philippines. if your freight forwarder is located in these cities, you will have the advantage that he will be more familiar with the loading and unloading rules of each port, making it easier to handle your goods, and saving you time. the top ports for importing into the philippines are manila port (this is the philippines' largest and busiest port), cebu port, iloilo port, subic port, and batangas port, sea freight shipping is the best choice for bulk goods transportation. when importing from china, you can choose full container load (fcl) or less than container load (lcl), if your overall cargo volume doesn’t meet one full container requirement. there are three types of containers 20 ft.,40 ft. and a 40 ft. high cube container. the 20 ft. containers are designed to carry more weight such as minerals, metals, machinery, sugar, paper, cement, etc., while the 40 ft. containers are designed to carry voluminous cargo rather than heavy cargo, for example, furniture, steel pipes, paper scrap, cotton, tobacco, etc. if you don’t have enough goods to fill a 20′ or a 40′ container (fcl), you should choose lcl. this enables importers to ship smaller amounts of cargo, which doesn’t have the right volume to make full container load a viable option. this means your cargo is combined with other shipping cargo at the same destination, reducing your shipping cost. when combining several shipments in one container, your freight forwarder needs to do more work. lcl freight is calculated in cubic meters (cbm) and charged based on the volume. fcl refers to when the quantity of your goods is large enough that they can be put in at least one container. in this case, the freight is calculated on an fcl basis. fcl shipment will be loaded and sealed at origin by your supplier, and then shipped to your final destination. * ***•air freight from china to the philippines:*** you should choose this mode of transportation if your goods are smaller than 2 cbm and 200 kg, and/or you are in a hurry to receive the goods. in a matter of days, air freight can bring your cargo from a factory in china to your destination. on average, you can expect your cargo to arrive in around 3 business days. the optimal amount of goods you can send by air freight is under 500 cbm because it won’t be that costly. although 90% of goods are shipped by sea, when importers and exporters need to move high-value goods to the philippines quickly and reliably such as seasonal goods, electronics, and/or perishable products, they use air freight. the main airports in the philippines are ninoy aquino international airport, clark international airport, laoag international airport, kalibo international airport, iloilo international airport, and mactan-cebu international airport. there are two classes of airfreight, economy and express or fast air transportation. 1) economic air freight: this service applies for general cargo such as no dangerous goods, or oversized or temperature-controlled goods. for this category, the price is relatively low compared with the express air freight. the time delivery for economic delivery is around 2 to 7 business days for the goods to be delivered to your doorstep. 2) fast air transportation: with this service, you can transport cargo of all shapes, sizes, and types in a short time, including dangerous and oversized goods. the time delivery for this mode of transportation is around 1 to 3 business days for the goods to be delivered to your doorstep. there are two methods to calculate the air freight price. the first method is a cost per kilogram multiplied by the cargo weight, and for the second one, for low-density cargo (low weight and high volume) you will be charged based on the volume it occupies. **part 3. how to save money?** to save money, you have to understand the terms fob, exw, cif, and dap because, in the same transport model, transport cost is a crucial factor. 1. ***understanding the terms: fob, exw, cif, and dap*** many websites like alibaba use the quotations fob, exw, cif, and dap. in general, these quotations include information about where your cargo is being shipped from and where, the transport mode and equipment being used, and shipment details such as dimensions, weight and a description of the goods. fob means free on board or freight on board and is an international shipping agreement used in the transportation of goods between a buyer and a seller. fob is the primary mode of alibaba’s quotation, which means that your chinese supplier will be responsible for the transportation from the chinese factory to the chinese loading and unloading port. for example, if you see fob ningbo – ningbo is a city and a port in china, it means that this is the port that the supplier will ship your order to, which is covered by the fob price, and from here, you are responsible for the freight. the freight is divided into two aspects – the first one is from china airport/port to the airport/port in the philippines, and the second one is from the airport/port in the philippines to your doorstep. exw stands for ex works. if you see this quotation on the website you are buying from, it means that the seller is making the goods available at their premises, or another named place. in other words, exw means that your freight has been increased one step, and you will be responsible for the transportation from the factory in china to the loading port in china. this is an aspect your chinese freight forwarder will help you manage. your shipping costs will divide into three categories – from china factory to china airport/port – from china airport/port to the philippines airport/port – from the philippines airport/port to your doorstep. over this, other transportation costs will be added such as chinese export costs and customs clearance costs. finding a reliable freight forwarder is important because he will let you know where every cost is going, with no hidden expenses. cif stands for cost, insurance, and freight, and it means that the supplier is responsible for all transportation costs from the factory in china to the airport/port in the philippines, including insurance. in other words, cif is an expense paid by the seller to cover the costs, insurance, and freight if a package or item is lost or damaged while it is in transit to an export port. the seller must cover other expenses such as additional customs, export paperwork, inspections or rerouting, but once the freight is loaded, you (the buyer) become responsible for all other costs, including the expenses from the airport or port in the philippines to your doorstep. with cif the supplier adds an extra charge to compensate for their efforts, and it becomes more expensive than fob. it will save you time and money if you find a freight forwarder, because usually, the suppliers in china will also find a freight forwarder to deal with the whole process, and they cannot professionally update the status of your goods promptly. dap stands for delivery at a place or destination delivery. if you see this quote on the website you are buying from, it means that the seller will handle all the charges and the delivery to the buyer facilities, but the import taxes will be paid by the buyer at the destination. once the goods are ready for shipment, the packing is done by the seller at his own cost, and then the goods are moved to the location of the customs opted by the seller at exporting country at his expense under dap terms. all the necessary legal formalities in the exporting country are completed by the seller at his costs and risks; also the insurance up to the destination is arranged by the seller. if it’s not mentioned in the contract, the unloading cost at the final destination has to be borne by you (the buyer). in other words, the seller is responsible for all the expenses and risks to deliver the goods up to the destination mentioned in the contract. from the destination mentioned in the contract, it becomes the buyer’s responsibility for the goods to reach his premises at his own expense. but even if the seller is responsible for all the shipping steps, he can’t do detailed work such as warehousing, labels, and goods inspection, so it is best to find a reliable freight forwarder, to help you with the detailed work. therefore, the best way to save money and time is by choosing fob or exw, because your goods will be in professional hands, with the lowest price, and the fastest time to reach your destination. 2. ***import duties and taxes in the philippines.*** all imports into the philippines are subject to duty and taxes. goods below $200 are duty-free, but are not exempted from other taxes; import tariff is applicable for goods over $ 200. import duties and taxes in the philippines are calculated based on cif value. the standard-duty rates for imports in the philippines vary from 0% to 65% according to the product, and the average duty rate stands at 10.5%. other customs charges that you may incur are sales tax (vat) (this applies to all imports), excise tax (for tobacco, alcohol, petroleum, mineral products, etc.), bulk and breakbulk cargo fees (for liquids, chemicals, petroleum products, grains and all dry bulk cargoes, wood, steel etc.). in the philippines, sales tax is applied to 12% of the total value of imports. 3. ***become familiar with size and weight calculation rules*** if you want to transport goods via express delivery and air freight you should take into consideration these rules because the costs can be high – the actual weight is calculated in kilograms (kg), and the volume is calculated in cubic meters (cbm). a) calculating the actual weight – if the actual weight of the goods in kilograms is more significant than its dimensional weight, it will be calculated like this: actual weight of the package x cost per kilogram (this price varies from company to company). b) when the volume of the goods is larger than the actual weight is called dimensional weight – this is an estimated weight calculated by multiplying the length of the package with the width and height divided by a dimensional factor, also called a dim divisor. dimensional factors are numbers set by the major freight carriers, and represent cubic inches per pound. the dimensional weight is the weight of the package at the minimum density accepted by the carrier. dimensional weight = length × width × height/dimensional factor international transport and logistics companies are based on the maximum value they can charge. for example, freight carriers like usps, fedex, or ups calculate shipping charges based on whichever number is greater (actual weight or dimensional weight). for example, if you have a package that has the actual weight of fewer than 31 kilograms (let’s say 29 kg), the freight carrier will charge for the dimensional weight of 31 kilograms since it is the greater number. for them, whichever number is higher becomes your billable weight. therefore, in some cases, to save money it is necessary to compress the package to reduce the measurement volume. finding an experienced freight forwarder will help you find the ideal solutions for shipping from china to the philippines, and will save you money and time. 4. ***plan ahead to avoid the rush hour*** in general, planning ahead will help you avoid trouble. in international transportation, you always have to plan your shipment in advance because the delivery time of your goods is the crucial factor that decides the mode of transportation. holidays in china can have a great influence on your delivery time, and knowing the holidays’ schedule in china and important shipping deadlines and guidelines will save you time and money because in those peak periods the shipping prices are usually higher and the factories are closed. the peak seasons for shipping are: chinese new year – in this period factories and facilities shut down, causing price spikes and delays; golden week – this week-long festival exacerbates holiday season price spikes and delays; dragon boat festival – for this holiday businesses typically close for three days; holiday shopping season – prices rise steadily over months as businesses prepare for holiday shopping (october-december for air freight, july-october for sea freight). if your shipment is not urgent, you will save money and you will also have time to face unplanned delays such as congestion, blockages, supplier issues, and documentation mistakes. you can also ask questions surrounding the company’s response to delays, to see if they have procedures for resolving these issues. 5. ***find a hybrid transportation solution (multimodal transportation)*** freight forwarders can often work within their contacts to your advantage to help you achieve your goal faster and cheaper. they can offer the option of multimodal transportation combining air freight and sea freight with other forms of ground transportation (trucks, trains, or some other means of transport) for the delivery to be made in time and at a reasonable price. the multimodal transportation will deliver the goods in the correct time frame and keep your shipment on budget. multimodal transportation also known as combined or hybrid transportation is the transportation of goods with at least two different modes of transport, under a single contract. legally speaking, the carrier is responsible for the entire transport, and he does not have to possess all the means of transport. it comes with many advantages such as centralization of responsibility in one transport operator, economies of scale in transport negotiations, use of international experience in transportation, in the field of bureaucracy and commerce, better use of available infrastructure and more efficient means of transport, focused on cost reduction, and reduction of indirect costs. **conclusion** sometimes transporting goods from china can be a complicated process, because it involves many steps such as warehousing, document preparation, customs issues, cargo insurance, and so on, regardless of the mode of transportation you chose. with the rapid development of international trade, the international logistics industry has also grown, and choosing an experienced freight forwarder might be the key to finding solutions for shipping from china to the philippines.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/uxy41o/how_to_find_a_reliable_freight_forwarder_for/,26 05 2022

Virus overstated in Philippines due to climate,"i accept this will be both an unpopular post, and heaven forbid, even considered a extreme conspiracy theory, but hear me out. i have been closely following this particular viral strain spread throughout various countries since january, and one factor which is rarely mentioned is the fact that this virus, like other flu strains, survives and spreads much easier in cooler climates. relative to the rest of the world, the philippines does not have a cool climate. lets look at the facts regarding the current propagation of this virus directly linked to the countries current climate, sorted from worst to better. country cases climate (avg temp in celsius in january) china 81,000 0 italy 47,000 5 spain 22,000 8 germany 20,000 -5 iran 20,000 5 us 19,000 -5 france 13,000 5 korea 9,000 15 switzerland 6,000 -5 uk 4,000 5 netherlands 4,000 -5 austria 2,000 -5 now, some countries with warmer climates (25c+ degrees in january), sorted from countries with the most cases, to those better. country cases climate (avg temp in celsius in january) malaysia 1,000 25 brazil 800 28 australia 800 25 qatar 500 25 ... philippines 230 25 as you can see, the worst country with a warm climate has only 1000 cases. remember, every year in the us alone, about 50,000 people die because of regular flu strains during their winters. as an example, in 2018, the cdc reported that in the us and during the colder months of the year, 80,000 people died from the flu. this is not 80,000 cases, this is 80,000 deaths. ( https://www.statnews.com/2018/09/26/cdc-us-flu-deaths-winter/ ) even estimating regular flu strains having a high mortality rate of 2%, this would mean there were 4 million cases of regular flu strains just in the us during 2018's colder months. did you hear anything about that anywhere near the coverage that this current virus is getting - no. the philippines has many problems. i believe this virus is not one of them, but only through luck, more than anything else. there are many disadvantages (active and passive) to living in a hot and humid country - too many to list here, but here are also a few advantages, and an environment not conducive to certain viruses, like this one, is one of them. i find it understandable that the majority of philippine people are fearful of this virus. fear, propagated through various media forms is contagious itself, irrespective of whether it is warranted or not. i could go deeper into this, but at the moment i will not. just look at who can use this as an opportunity. with social media so prevalent these days, the masses can be easily manipulated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/fm8w23/virus_overstated_in_philippines_due_to_climate/,21 03 2020

Clearing up misconceptions about 2019-nCoV,"yesterday, during the parents' plenary in lpu, i've had the honor of listening to prof. oliver dumaoal's briefing on ncov - and i would like to give him credit for doing an incredible job of explaining to parents and students about the situation of this newfound virus. with that being said, and as a sci-tech editor of my school paper, here's my attempt to explain everything he said in hopes to change everyone's perspective of novel coronavirus. what is this? 2019 novel coronavirus (connoted as ncov) is a virus outbreak that apparently originated from wuhan, china. as the newest addition to the coronavirus family (sars-cov and mers-cov are its ""older"" siblings), it possesses some traits similar to the previous viruses. according to the centers for disease control and prevention, its symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. once infected, these symptoms will appear between 2 to 14 days. but most of the confirmed cases have shown that it takes longer times before these symptoms appear. currently, there is no particular cure for the virus. its symptoms, however, are a different story. according to reports, most people become asymptomatic when they're prescribed with medicine for the symptoms (paracetamol, the most commonly used drug used to treat fever, helps patients with ncov deal with fever and thus become asymptomatic after a few days.) how do you get infected? a person carrying this virus, according to statistics, can infect 2 people on average. numerous risk assessments and other statistics have shown that compared to the number of people infected by measles, you are much less likely to be infected by ncov. an explanation for this would be the transmission of the virus. ncov isn't an airborne virus: it can only be transmitted via body fluids (coughing, sneezing, and transmission of saliva.) simply put, a person cannot be infected easily by the virus, especially by breathing in public places. a person can only be infected if he is in close contact with the virus, if he touches something contaminated by the infected person's sneeze or coughs, or if an infected person sneezes on another person. on note of hygiene however, a person is vulnerable or at risk of being infected if the person does not practice proper hygiene. although the risk of being infected is relatively low, it significantly decreases if a person washes his hands regularly and properly. surgical masks are excellent in preventing airborne diseases, and it helps in decreasing the risk of getting infected; however, this isn't necessary for countries like the philippines, since there are only a few suspected cases of the virus. additionally, the best method of preventing yourself from being infected would be washing your hands thoroughly and regularly. should i get checked? there are few criteria for being checked for the virus. if a person has close contact with an infected person, if the person has contacted an infected person's body fluids, or if you have been to the province of hubei (particularly in the city of wuhan) in the past week or month, then it is best to get checked for the virus. however, if you answered ""no"" to the criteria mentioned, then there is no need to be alarmed. the public outcry for novel coronavirus has been misinterpreted: your risk of getting infected is low, its symptoms can be easily cured, and it is easily preventable. what's more, the ratio of people dying to the virus to the number of confirmed cases of infection is low (as of 31 january 2020, 213 have died while 9826 are confirmed to have the virus, a 1:50 ratio of deaths to confirmed cases.) we can never be too safe with this virus. although the posed threat for the virus is blown out of proportion, there's no harm in washing your hands more often to prevent the virus from spreading. stay safe, wash your hands more often, and be vigilant. sources: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019 https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200131-sitrep-11-ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=de7c0f7_2 https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/risk-assessment-pneumonia-wuhan-china-22-jan-2020.pdf",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ex2ory/clearing_up_misconceptions_about_2019ncov/,1 02 2020
COVID-19 experience and how the LGU handled it.,"3 weeks ago my parents were positive for covid-19. the reason why? my mom went to our relatives across town to take care of my lola who asked for her to stay the night. my mom said my tita there was coughing and had fever, she asked for her to get tested. the next day my mom went home, cooked for us and basically had direct contact with the whole fam. before going to bed my parents received a call that my tita was positive for the antigen test. we asked the lgu to mass test everyone in that household but they refused and only swabbed my tita because she only had the symptoms. it also took 5 days before they got the result. i isolated my mom for that 5 days hoping my tita was negative but sadly she wasn’t. on that same day we found out she was positive we asked a private laboratory approved by the doh to swab us at home and also my relatives who were living with my tita. turns out 7/10 of my relatives living with my tita were positive including my pregnant cousin, my lola, my tita with autism and my 4 yr old nephew and 2/5 were positive in our home i was so devastated because my mom has asthma and hypertension while my dad has type 2 diabetes. thankfully my mom was asymptomatic and my dad only had mild symptoms. yes they took human grade ivermectin prescribed by a physician and it really helped. i was already drinking vitamins c, zinc and omega-3 ever since pandemic started maybe that’s why i had a strong immune system and didn’t get the virus even though i had direct contact with my parents all throughout the quarantine. i had to check their vitals everyday. i am sharing my experience because the largest cases of transmission is through household transmission and still the gov’t keeps locking us up in our houses. the implementation of lockdowns, faceshields, transportation suspensions, curfews and restrictions in public places pushed the filipino people to remove every protective gears they have once they step inside the comfort of their homes because the outside implementations are too much to handle. not to mention no healthcare worker visited us for the whole quarantine. my parents could basically just walk out, i almost tied my father inside because he keeps setting up appointments and errands during quarantine and if i wasn’t there he would’ve went out. on the 10th day of quarantine the brgy nurse contacted me and asked how we were and said that if we were feeling okay they will assign us as recovered on that same day. i asked the nurse if we will undergo swab test before we were assigned as recovered and they told me “if asymptomatic na po hindi na sila isswab.” i told them my mom was asymptomatic on the very first day of quarantine but still she tested positive. the nurse asked how my mom was swabbed if she was asymptomatic, i told them we hired a private lab to swab us at home since the lgu is not providing it to us. the swab costs 3,200 each for rt-pcr testing. we got swabbed after two weeks of quarantine by the same private laboratory and now all of us are negative. imagine if we didn’t have the money for swab tests, my relatives and parents would have been roaming free spreading covid just because the gov’t refused to swab them as they were asymptomatic. imagine if my parents didn’t have access to human grade ivermectin or vitamins then my parents with comorbidities would’ve faced severe symptoms. am i the only one seeing something wrong with how the gov’t is handling this pandemic? it’s frustrating that you can’t do anything about it, more people are suffering it’s been more than a year and it’s becoming a cycle. if anyone here is from the gov’t please implement mass testing more contact tracing and remove the freaggin face shields my eye glasses won’t fit with it and bikers are getting in accidents because of it, just tell everyone to use medical grade face masks instead. please i don’t want another year taken away from our lives.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/mpd6ot/covid19_experience_and_how_the_lgu_handled_it/,12 04 2021
[Showerthoughts] Taal Eruption helped alot of Filipinos prepare for the Corona virus by buying face masks for the ash.,"just to help out the rest of us who can't buy masks, here's how to make your own gas mask from water bottles: [https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/make-improvised-gas-mask/!] https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/make-improvised-gas-mask/ - you can find filters for masks in hardware stores like ace hardware or home depot. you can find n95 masks (recommended by who) at big hardware stores if your pharmacy runs out. remember, corona virus can also be transmitted through the eyes, so make sure you wear shades, glasses or goggles if you can. avoid rubbing your eyes for now. and make sure to wash your hands and use alcohol. hand sanitizer is not enough. avoid public places. stay home to reduce the spread. and the most important thing is to not panick. if you feel that you suddenly have a fever, cough, and trouble breathing, seek medical attention immediately. vicks and vaporub jokes aside, your life and health is no laughing matter. attention: if you guys really want to have masks, i don't recommend it since i don't think they can block out viruses (like the facemask you can buy at bangketas with coco martins smile), but you can buy filter masks and respirators at hardware stores - https://mchomedepot.com/product-category/safety-devices/mask/ if you can afford it, buy dust respirators that p3 grade or higher. here is a picture of all masks that will work with viruses: https://imgur.com/a/btb0wyj share that last link to loved ones and friends. i highly implore you to click that link for you to know what the correct mask is to buy. oh, and someone reminded me. [redacted]. if it came from a chinese supplier, that has been tested by another human by wearing it. you can sanitize it with uv-c light (be careful with using uv-c light) or just ensure that it remains untouched (days including transit) in the box for 5 days so that the mask self-sanitizes after 5 days.

"Both Of My Knees Experiences Discomfort, Mga Kapwa Pinoy Please Help Me","i am 18 (m) 5'9"" and 60 kilos, who had been having knee discomforts for the past 3 weeks. the knee causes slight pain when cold winds brush past it after leg exercises. as for the daily discomfort, it gets noticably uncomfortable when i fully extend my knees and put all of my body weight on them. the history of my knees goes way back to 8th grade when i first started to hear pops every time i squat too deeply on the ground to sit. throughout 7th and 8th grade, i was not mindful of what i ate or do. but on my 9th grade, i started to do body weight training which got me somewhat fit. soon, however, i stopped in 10th grade. then, when i got into 11th and 12th grade (now), i was living a sedentary life-style that consisted of barely decent eating habits and stressing over text books and academic grades. 3 months ago, my dad bought a gym-equipment and so i started exercising. this led me to (on and off) lift weights an hour for 4 days a week. first, i started slow and light, but then i had seem to over-etimate my strength and soon lifted weights that was beyond my ability. a month in, i started doing deadlifts and squats that weighs 60 pounds (one day a week). my workout routine's plan was just to do reps until i feel like i can't do 2 more reps. with all being said, i suspect that the main cause is weight-lifting. also, i am in modular learning during this pandemic. which means that, for me, i have to get my modules in places that requires me to travel far away. every friday, i would drive my motorcycle for an hour just to get my modules, and during such, my knee would be open towards the harsh sunlight. it must be known that for the past few years, i was s person that loved shades because sunlight hurts my skin. which is why over time, i suspect that it also had somewhat damaged my knees to an extent, which had also led me to suffer faster damage on my knees. i live in the philippines and i come from a low-middle class filipino family. these past few days, i had always been confused and don't know what to do. my dad is jobless and my mom is a domestic helper abroad. we are hardly getting money during these times, and it saddens me to think that they will spend for my injuries. but if it needs to be done, then i would get it over with and would not let it worsen. please help me. please tell me the steps that i need to take to get bettee and the possible costs of my treatment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/kjbjie/both_of_my_knees_experiences_discomfort_mga_kapwa/,24 12 2020
Considering dropping out of school until face-to-face classes are back. Is this a good idea?,"i'm currently a grade 12 student and its around this time college applications are starting. my sister, who's currently a 1st year med student, opened up to our father about dropping out after her 1st sem of med school because she's not learning anything at all. he said we should talk about this with our classmates and see if we're not the only ones who're considering to drop out. aside from not learning anything, i just can't see myself to be a college student with this online set-up. it's hard to focus during zoom classes. what i do focus on though is the workload teachers give us but its not in the good way. its just for the sake of compliance at this point. my mental health has seriously deteriorated during this school year and i don't want to go through all of that again with college. i don't want my parents to waste their money on education thats not even effective. any advice? edit: thanks for the comments everyone! i had a lengthy talk with my sister and while i'm still indecisive, i'm leaning towards continuing my education. unlike her, i don't have a college degree yet so we'd be in different situations if we decide to drop out. what i have in mind kasi is continuing your education with a foundation as weak as this would just come back and bite me in the ass when the time comes to apply what i learned. on the other hand, due to the incompetence sa government natin, di natin alam kung kailan babalik ang face-to-face classes. for all we know baka umabot pa ito ng 3 years and i don't have any concrete plans yet for the time i'll have so waiting for it wouldn't be ideal either. its really a mix bag, not to mention ang mental health ko na it was at its all time low last semester. i dont want to know if it can go even lower next school year. so ayun. still a bit confused but now added with a bit of clarity. again thanks for the insights. i'll try to weigh my decisions well",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/kurrik/considering_dropping_out_of_school_until/,11 01 2021

Lucky Me Curly Spaghetti,"on the topic of noodles, this got my emotions on a rollercoaster. dati when i was in grade school, maggi's instant spaghetti noodle have a special place in my heart on how tasty it was. nung nawala nalang sya sa stores, i was hugely disappointed and turned to lucky me spaghetti. i didn't like lm's taste as a kid so the instant spaghetti craze of my kid self went away. as an adult, i did adjusted with lm's spaghetti, midnight snack and merienda, right? oks sya and delish for a 17php srp spaghetti. up until around the late months of 2021. nawala ang lm's spag bigla sa any groceries i went to and i was just miserable in every store i don't see the noodle anymore. i thought to myself maybe what happened to maggi happened to lm as well and i grieved the loss. (medyo oa pero idk it's not an occasional snack pero it's something i weirdly held with me?? lol) later april this year i had the thought to search the instant spag on shopee and i got happily surprised na meron papala? pero iba na packaging. excited kong binili and what the hell? hahahaha sobrang nipis ng noodles!! ginawa nilang abot kaya yung presyo around 8-12php i can't remember clearly pero ayon. same taste, but the quality of the noodles is kinda ewan ko nakakadiri? feeling ko ngumunguya ako ng mga worms na itsurang worms ng mga pusa ko pag dinedeworm ko sila kasi puti sya at sobrang nipis hahaha. i bought like 10 pieces, i still love the taste. pero the noodle thinness and texture is slowly turning me off. the price adjustment made the product suffer and i'm just sadly eating my spag noodles now while i type this away. i love making any types of noodles, red sauce or white sauce with any type of meats and seafood. it's delish, and i can't get enough of them. pero i guess instant spaghetti holds a special place in my heart that's slowly fading away. kahit panakip butas lang sya sa gutom ko pag medyo low on finances. thanks for coming to my tedtalk!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ujtam0/lucky_me_curly_spaghetti/,6 05 2022
On Pork Imports and the Threat to Hog Industry,"yesterday, president duterte signed [executive order no. 128](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1416103/duterte-temporarily-cuts-tariff-rate-for-imported-pork-products). this temporarily lowers the in-quota tariff from 30 % down to a staggering 5 %. the above quota meanwhile is lowered from 40 % to 15 %. for the uninformed, in-quota tariffs simply means an imposed tax or duties within the prescribed minimum access volume (mav) or import quota; any import beyond that is subject to above quota/out-quota tariffs. at first glance, it seems sensible to allow more pork imports to resolve an undersupply of pork. that is, if you believe that it's totally an issue of supply. note that even the department of agriculture in early [january](https://news.abs-cbn.com/business/01/08/21/da-ensures-pork-supply-from-visayas-mindanao-as-prices-surge-in-luzon) and [february](https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1130877) did not believe that the spike in pork prices was an issue of supply. now, the [cheapest farmgate price](https://www.rappler.com/business/department-agriculture-yet-show-proof-pork-price-manipulation) is at p180 per kilo in general santos city. provinces near metro manila is around p200 to p220 per kilo. thus, for the samahang industriya ng agrikultura, a retail price between p330 - p380 per kilo is only acceptable. can we blame our local hog producers for the african swine fever (asf) and restricted transportation? the real score: the problem with pork is a [problem of distribution](https://mb.com.ph/2020/09/14/import-bans-to-hike-meat-prices-by-christmas/). the shortage in luzon was a result of it being the hardest hit in the region of asf, while there really is a surplus in visayas and mindanao. in line with the problem of distribution, farmers called for gov't to compensate asf-hit pork producers and subsidize the transportation of pork. another proposed resolution was to ask malacanang to declare a public emergency, to allow the da to realign funds to address asf infestation, in the form of fund assistance. let's compare that to the imported pork. did you know that the [data](https://www.philstar.com/business/2021/03/26/2086964/higher-tariff-pork-imports-put-hold) from the bureau of customs (boc) shows that the declared price or landed meat of swine averaged at p81 per kilo from january 2020 to january 2021? how much do importers sell it for retail? p350 to p450 (between january and february when local pork registered spikes)! just imagine their profit margin! who profits besides pork importers? well, their international partners. other countries wanting to open the philippine economy and flood them with imports. here's what an american senior trade editor [wrote](https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/15653-philippines-opens-up-to-more-pork-imports): ""the philippines, already a big importer of u.s. pork, is lowering its tariffs to allow for more foreign supplies as the country continues to battle african swine fever, according to an announcement made wednesday by the national pork producers council. \[...\] the expanded market access is expected to generate significantly more u.s. pork exports to the country."" anyone with a sense of history knows that our history is a history of free trade. so why did the department of agriculture retracted? profit, profit, profit, people. and kickbacks! from confidence in supply to recommending a 650 % increase in minimum access volume. jess cham, president of meat importers and traders association, and their group even pegs the meat supply deficit at [six million metric tons](https://www.cnnphilippines.com/business/2021/2/8/pork-supple-tighten-price-freeze-.html). [senator lacson](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1407308/lacson-bares-p6b-tongpats-scheme-in-pork-importation) actually already raised concerns over an alleged money-making scheme in the importation of meat. an 'insider' information estimate revealed by lacson said that a syndicate within the da collecting p5-p7 a kilo from imported meat may earn 'tongpats' amounting to p6 billion a year. lacson's number, however, was capped at 400,000 metric tons, while duterte's a little over a week ago pushed it to 404, 210 as recommended by da. if true, kickbacks would exceed beyond the 6 billion estimate of lacson. do note, however, that mav or import quota doesn't mean quantitative restriction, 15 % out-quota tariff itself is too low to import more and more. in line with this, da already allotted p45m for freezers or chillers to be distributed in metro manila in wet markets for the imported pork. but what's p45m compared to billions of kickbacks? with that [hog raisers warned](https://news.abs-cbn.com/business/03/28/21/hog-raisers-to-stop-operations-if-govt-cuts-pork-tariff-industry-group) that they will be forced to stop their operations, for the effect alone of 350,000 metric tons is equivalent to 8,000,000 heads of hog that would flood the market. such numbers would render local hog raisers incapable of competing especially with the threat of african swine flu. the government, thus, having lowered import tariffs effectively served them their death sentence. this country already failed to industrialize and now they want to kill industries that provide for food security. this is a country that when local products dwindle, they liberalize without support for recovery, expecting local industries to compete and magically become efficient. do you even think that with the recent rice tarrification law, rice production will recover even up to producing surplus? sa totoo lang, import if needed. but that has long been abused by the government, technocrats and foreigners that enter the market. we need efficient monitoring. kaso lang ang karamihan sa atin nakatuon lang sa presyo. sobrang tuwa natin kung mababa ang presyo dahil sa mga import, kahit pa at the expense of our agriculture and other local industries. magtataka pa ba tayo kung bakit wala na nagbabalak na pumasok sa agrikultura? napakasuperficial ng efforts ng pamahalaan na manghikayat ng kabataan na pumasok sa agrikultura eh pinapatay naman nila ang industriya. god forbid na kapag nagkagiyera, without food security even the capability to make bullets on our own, this land will fall to its knees. kawawang pilipinas. masyadong marami na ang baboy sa pamahalaan.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/mmj5vw/on_pork_imports_and_the_threat_to_hog_industry/,8 04 2021
BBM's first 100 days (Long read),"q: how would you grade the first 100 days of pres marcos? a: i would do what i've done with every president. first, i will ask what did he inherit from his predecessor? then i will compare what he has done in his first 100 with his inheritance to what his predecessor did with his in his first 100 days. the first 100 are first steps in a six year journey so they are merely an indicator of where the president will be taking us - up a hill or over a cliff? there will be course corrections (or maybe none) as the journey moves forward or backward as the case may be. that's why i believe the first 100 is a mere indicator of where the president might take us. having said that, let me share what i felt during the first 100 days of previous presidents starting with gma. (i was living abroad during the entire term of cory and the first 2 years of fvr so i can't compare fvr's first 100 to cory's nor erap's first 100 to fvr's.) gma's first 100 made me happy and relieved and her second first 100 in 2004 made me feel the exact opposite. but looking back, i've realized the alternative in 2004 would have been a first 100 for fpj who made movies difficult to watch for even 100 seconds. and after she took her oath in 2004, her successor would have been noli de castro. in short, the alternatives could have been really disastrous. pnoy gave me the same happiness and relief i felt during gma's original first 100 and for the most part that feeling stayed with me for six years. there were a few disappointments here and there, nobody's perfect, but overall he didn't make me feel let down. my optimism remained high all throughout his presidency. duterte's first 100 were unbearable and so were the rest of his remaining 2090 days as president. bloody corpses in depressed areas, embarrassing and cringey appearances on both world and domestic stages, corruption so unbridled that not even a pandemic could slow it down, total destruction of institutions of checks and balance vital for the survival of democracy and the rule of law. and i'm just getting started so let's leave it at that. and now pres bbm. first i'll be honest. i was very disappointed leni lost and fearful bbm would become another duterte. but it is what it is so let's move on and compare his first 100 to duterte's first 100. pres bbm made some good appointments and some awful ones - calida (glad he didn't last 100 days), enrile, bersamin, and sara to name the worst choices for vital positions. and he also neglected a vital appointment. up to now, he has not appointed a health secretary despite his having extended the covid public health emergency until december. he radically departed from duterte on matters most important to duterte: 1) he met with biden to recalibrate our bilateral relations and by so doing tempered duterte's fevered romance with xi jin ping, 2) he shared a well thought out reservation about bringing back the death penalty, and, in the greatest departure of all, 3) announced a drug war policy that would focus on stemming supply i.e. go after big time drug smugglers and dealers instead of the little guys whose corpses duterte loved to use as props for his war on drugs. further he will focus on educating the youth on the dangers of drug abuse and he will undertake the rehabilitation of addicts. (similar to leni's humane approach on drugs) so, barring any course corrections, his war on drugs will definitely be humane and rational compared to his predecessor's which was barbaric and insane. i fully support bbm's position on the death penalty and the war on drugs. there are opportunities he must not let pass in the coming 2090 days, opportunities that will allow history to judge him on his own merits rather than as marcos junior: 1) the assassination of radio commentator lapid must be solved with both the assassins and mastermind(s) brought to justice asap. one does not have to ennumerate what bringing those involved in that murder will do to put meat on his pronouncements regarding his commitment to human rights, press freedom, the rule of law and his abhorrence for violence and criminality. related to this would be strengthening the commission on human rights with legislation and certifying as urgent the enactment of the freedom of information bill. 2) he must appoint the right person to chair the coa. that will correct the bad impression created when he appointed calida, a duterte stooge who raised eyebrows in coa over contracts his family-owned security agency entered into with several govt agencies including congress while he was solgen. pres bbm must appoint a coa chair who will lay to rest any doubts about his stated commitment to clean and honest governance. related to appointing an uncompromising coa chair, the successful prosecution of crooked govt officials will happen only if ombudsman samuel martires is replaced. martires can only be removed through impeachment but he can be persuaded to resign. pres bbm must also certify as urgent those necessary amendments to the bank secrecy law and amendments that will make the anti-money laundering agency more effective. 3) set the example for other branches of gov't, i.e. congress, judiciary, and constitutional bodies by issuing an order mandating that all salns of executive branch employees be posted online. goverment works best when given the right working conditions. as vp leni never tired of reminding us, ""sa gobyernong tapat, aangat tayong lahat."" 🙂 finally, beware of optics in a society that suffers from a huge wealth disparity. pnoy was attacked by his own dilawans when he bought a used porsche with his own money. he ended up having to sell it immediately. one does not have to sleep under a kulambo, eat with his hands in a carenderia, and wear a kamiseta although it will be good to keep in mind that those antics produced a net satisfaction rating of 81% for one president.🤣🤣",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/xwyki7/bbms_first_100_days_long_read/,6 10 2022

Looking for clinic/therapist for anxiety,"when i was still a kid, i know there is something wrong with me. i'm not the type of kid that is happy go lucky or love to meet new people back then. i always have this ""nervous and shy"" feeling everytime i'm new to a community or mostly during first day of classes. lagi akong kinakabahan. i remember hanggang grade 3 umiiyak pako nun sa first day of school. hahaha nakakatawa pero yung takot ko that time hindi ko ma-explain nung bata pako. hindi ko alam kung anong tawag dun sa feeling na yun, as i grow up i started researching sa mga bagay na yun and found out that i'm suffering from ""social axiety disorder"". sad hindi alam ng parents ko at hanggang ngayon may ""anxiety"" pa rin ako. one thing na cause nun is yung favoritism ng parents ko sa panganay namin at sa bunso namin. parehas kasi silang matalino. yung ate ko nasa canada na, yung bunso may honor pagka graduate ng k-12. me, being the middle kid is kabaliktaran. kaya nung bata pa kami laging sinasabi ng mama ko na kesyo hindi ako matalino or smart. lagi akong mali sa lahat ng bagay. alam ko naman yun sa sarili ko. hindi ako smart at matalino katulad nila but on the other handa mahilig ako mag painting, sa arts. minana ko yung pagkahilig sa painting sa side nila mama. pero still lagi kong sinasabi sa sarili ko na may kulang sakin. kasi siguro sa sinasabi ng mama ko sakin, na kahit kailan hindi daw ako natuto. kaya ginawa ko lahat nag-aral mabuti, as in bahay-eskwela lang ako nung college, walang bisyo until now. at never ko siya binigyan ng problema. masasabi ko na ""good daughter"" ako, lahat ng gusto niya ginagawa ko. pero bakit ganun parang hindi enough para sa kanya? naka graduate nako at nagka work pero still hindi ko naramdaman na naging proud siya sakin. yung mga words na sinasabi niya at pagkukumpara sakin sa ibang tao? it just made my anxiety worst. mas lalong bumaba self-confidence ko at low-esteem talaga ako. minsan sinasabi ko na sana naging matalino na lang ako katulad ng mga kapatid ko. i hate it when parents are neglectful to the 'other kid' and has favoritism. kaya yung anxiety ko hindi na nawala hanggang ngayon. naging parte na siya ng buhay ko. worst, everytime na gagawa ako ng decision ko sa buhay, nag aalala ako kasi takot akong magkamali, na may sasabihin nanaman yung mama ko ng kung ano-ano. even sa mga job interviews ko andami kong iniisip, natatakot ako na kapag di ko nakuha yung job offer ano nanaman. sometimes i honestly don't know what else to do with my life. merun akong mga suicidal thoughts. now i'm 28 years old, i know i need a therapist. yes, hindi ko sasabihin sa kanila why? because i know they will never understand. i remember my mom saying nagseself pity daw ako and my elder sister saying napaka negative ko daw mag isip. narealized ko na mas mahirap kung sarili mong family members hindi ka maiintindihan. sa mga parents na nakakabasa nito, please don't be so hard on your kids kasi hindi niyo alam ang impact sa kanila hanggang sa paglaki nila. as of now, i badly need a therapist. sana yung affordable din pero willing to pay naman ako. any suggestions will be appreciated. ncr are lang po thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ia6g3s/looking_for_clinictherapist_for_anxiety/,15 08 2020

"Applying for Non-Pro driver's license, Concerns about the Practical Exam and ""Failure Cooldowns""","hello everyone, just sharing my thoughts and concerns sa lto practical exam. **tl:dr**, i failed my motorcycle practical driving test (manual clutch) **question #1** is, kapag pasado ba sa theoretical (written) exam pero bagsak sa practical exam, next na punta ko ba sa lto ay mag-tetake pa rin ako ng theoretical exam ulit? **question #2(edit)**, about po sa rule ng student's permit na kailangan daw ng licensed na kasama/or lto-accredited instructor. for cars, simple lang kasi pwedeng katabi mo or passenger mo. pero hindi clear yung pang motor. dapat bang angkas mo yung kasama mong lisensiyado? pwede bang ride as convoy? or by group ride? hindi po kasi properly stated yung scenarios pag sa motor. isipin mo, beginner rider ka, tapos pag-aangkasin ka pa, diba. **question #3**, base sa nababasa kong lto driver license guides for year 2022 from various sites, failure makapasa sa either written or practical sa 1st attempt is 7-day cooldown, which happened to me. and failure daw na makapasa for the 2nd time will results in 1 year ""ban"", or as in bawal na bumalik para mag-apply sa lto for 1 year. then after the 3rd time is 2-year ""ban"". totoo po ba ito? base po kasi sa lto site mismo, repubuc act no. 10930, [link's here](https://lto.gov.ph/images/issuances/irr/irr_ra10930.pdf), on pdf's page 17/23, wala naman nakaindicate na 1 year or 2 years ""cooldown"" ka kapag bumagsak ka sa 2nd or 3rd attempt, respectively. so, ayun, kinakabahan at nalilito lang po ako kung magpapaka-**valentino rossi** ba muna ako sa loob ng 1-year gamit yung student's license ko bago mag non-pro. salamat po sa mga sasagot. &#x200b; story time lang pala kung bakit ako bumagsak: **tl:dr ulit:** gutom at pagod ka na buong araw, pag practical mo bulok yung motor nila na para bang sinadya for higher chance of failure, jerky yung naging arangkada ko dahil adjusting parin ako nang pinatigil ako, sobrang inconsiderate nung evaluator parang nananadyang pabalikin ka o mag-resort ka sa ""lagay"". bali kasi, holder na ako ng student's permit for a month and confident naman ako na kaya kong mag-drive ng manual motorcycle since may experience na talaga ako pero recent lang nagka-permit. kahit dito dito lang ako sa subdivision namin na masikip ako nagppractice, kayang kaya naman. i'm still not that experienced lalo na at higher speeds kasi subdivision nga lang 'to, pero at low speeds, confident naman ako sa manuevering/throttle/clutch/braking skills. pasado na rin ako sa pdc ko, and sa totoo lang, kahit yung gamit kong motor doon ibang iba sa motor ko ay nakapag-adjust agad ako. 15 hours pdc na inenrollan ko and yung sessions na nangyari lang sakin is 1 and a half hours lang for 4 days straight dahil kita naman ng instructor na kaya ko naman imaneho yung motor. nakuha ko rin agad yung pdc certificate ko after ng sessions, so ayun tingin ko, ganito lang pala kadali 'tong pdc. easy easy lang ako syempre wala rin namang negative remarks sakin yung instructor ko. then ayon, after a month of holding my student's permit, nag try na ako i-proseso yung non-pro ko nang mailabas ko na rin yung motor ko since ako lang may driver's license kung sakali at bawal naman daw kasi mag-drive in the baranggay streets/highways kapag walang kasamang lisensyado na may driver's code na pang motor rin. edi yon, maaga akong pumila sa lto kasi alam niyo na sistema niyan, napakatagal at madalas pang nag-offline. nakapila na ako before 5, within 3 hours, nakausad na ako sa 1st window (verification lang ata yon ng docs mo) then sa cashier. and then nag-offline daw ang server for 2 hours. mga lunch na rin nang bumalik yung servers daw so ayun waiting lang ulit matawag yung name ko, mga 2+ hours ulit bago natawag ulit yung pangalan ko sa biometrics. pagtapos non mga 1hour pa ulit bago matawag yung pangalan ko for the exam. theoretical exam, pasado naman 50/60, so walang problema. ngayon, ito na, practical exam, tinawag rin pangalan ko ng evaluator ko. una kong napansin, yung motor nila doon, yung parang pang tricycle na motor. wala naman akong problema doon as long as flat footed ko yung motor. weight, okay naman, kayang kaya. clutch, sanay ako sa 1-down-5-up dahil sa motor ko pero yung motor doon, rotary style, 1 to 5 is just down, also the clutch levers, medyo matigas at magaspang pero sige ganito rin naman halos yung sa pdc ko. ang malaking bagay sakin ay kung paano maghandle yung motor, the handlebars and the accelerator. sa case ng motor nila doon, sobrang napaka **pangit** (emphasis on bold pangit) ng accelerator. as in, hindi siya standard kumbaga, out-of-spec. most motorcycle owners knows this, nasa manual nga mismo iyon, na dapat atleast keep your throttle/accelerator on spec, with just the right amount of free play when engaging, yung hindi mo sobrang ihahagod yung braso mo mag-gas lang diba. itong motor nila doon, para namang sinadya na napaka-luwang. parang 1-1.5 inches yung bite point ng throttle. syempre maninibago ako, yung motor ko hindi ganito yung feeling. kakadyot talaga unang humagod doon eh. sinabihan ko rin yung evaluator ko about doon, na hindi ito yung nakasanayan kong motor na pagpraktisan at kung pwede bang gamayin ko muna, pumayag naman siya. yung unang lap ko sa testing, syempre jerky yung unang arangkada dahil kinakapa ko pa. naka isang lap din ako sa test drive. for the 2nd lap, pinahinto na ako ng evaluator at sabing ""pwede na yan, gamay mo na"", so ayun, reset konti, stop-start ng makina, check side mirrors, lights, brakes and clutch, then go. unfortunately, dahil jerky pa rin yung pang 2nd lap ko dahil sa lintik na throttle at clutch na yan, hindi talaga sapat yung isa o dalawang ikot lang. pero ayun, expected ko more tries pa dahil adjusting pa rin ako at wala pang 2 minutes literally yung session, pinahinto na agad ako at sabing wala daw ako sa control. hindi man nga lang niya nilatag yung critical guidelines bago ako nagstart eh, wala ring consideration na hindi naman iyan yung motor na gagamitin ko once nasa kalye na. para bang nananadyang mang-bagsak para pabalikin ka o mapilitang ka mag bigay ng ""lagay"". yung papel ko nga walang remarks o name niya eh, pirma pirma lang ng kung ano ano, tapos pencil pa gamit, para easy correction ata sa magbibigay ng ""lagay"". wala ring demerit points akong nakita as basis. hindi ko nga maituturing na pwede na akong grade-an doon dahil klarong klaro naman ako sa pag-papaalam na nag-aadjust pa rin ako. pero, wala. pinaakyat na agad ako doon sa examiner para i-tag na failed yung practical ko, once flagged na failed ka, uploaded agad yon sa online portal nila at makikita mong may cooldown ka for 7-days. yun lang, nakakafrustrate lang, sayang yung pagod at gutom nang halos isang araw, nag-leave pa naman ako sa work ko para doon. mali ko lang rin na hindi ako nag-dala ng sariling motor. hindi ko rin kasi ineexpect na ganun yung kalagayan ng practice bike nila doon, saka dahil studen't permit nga lang ako at walang kasamang may lisensiya with proper driver codes, hindi ko rin naman mailalabas yung motor ko ""legally"", dami pa namang pa-checkpoint kotong dito samin, playing safe lang

Your thoughts on this statement by an epidemiologist on Why We Cannot Do MassTesting?,"from dr. edsel salvana understanding testing for covid-19 – and why mass testing might not be what you think it is so much acrimony on proper testing for covid-19, when in fact i think everyone wants the same thing – enough testing to help us control the pandemic. testing is complicated, and just like the fable of the blind men and the elephant, anyone can spin a convincing tale of what should be done. but you need to look at the different aspects to see the big picture. it isn’t as simple as doing as many tests as we want and the problem will go away. it is doing the right test at the right time that will make a difference. 1. there are two types of testing: clinical testing and epidemiologic testing. clinical testing is when you test someone for a disease so you can treat them properly. for covid-19, the best test to determine whether someone is sick and is spreading virus is the rt-pcr. rt-pcr is best done on people who have just started having symptoms since rt-pcr detects the genetic material of the virus. if the virus is present in high enough quantities, the test will be positive. if rt-pcr is done too early or too late, it will not detect the virus and will be falsely negative. knowing this, doctors will look at a patient and label one a “probable case” even if the test is negative, if there is exposure and the clinical picture (fever, cough, pneumonia) is consistent with disease. that is why we test people with symptoms and also healthcare workers who are highly exposed. we act on the results of this individual test – isolate, trace and treat. epidemiologic testing is done to get a picture of the spread of a disease in the community. it may not change what you do with the individual patient, but it is a good guide to policy. this testing can be done with a reliable antibody test. testing everyone in a community is not needed, as a properly taken representative sample can give a good idea of what is going on in the community. the best antibody test for epidemiologic testing is a laboratory-based elisa because these are much more sensitive and specific than rapid antibody tests. sampling methodologies are really important to make sure that the sample you are getting is truly representative of the community spread of the virus. if you only test people with exposure (in contrast with clinical testing), it will give you a falsely high result. 2. what is mass testing, and is it feasible? it really depends on how you define it. if you define mass testing as population-based testing, meaning testing everyone regardless of symptoms and exposure in order to pick out those infected, then it is not feasible and not useful. a. there is no point in testing someone who is not exposed and has no risk. it is just a waste of money and may come back as a false positive. b. even if you test everyone and they are negative, it doesn’t mean they will no longer be exposed to the virus the next day and become a carrier and a case afterwards. c. even rt-pcr will fail to detect virus within the first three days of the incubation period and you will miss a lot of asymptomatic (someone without symptoms) carriers. d. antibody testing for asymptomatic carriers is even worse than rt-pcr – they will not be positive because asymptomatic carriers haven’t produced enough antibodies to make the test positive. antibody tests become positive about 7 days after the symptoms show up and are best done after 14 days of symptoms because antibody levels are low until someone is on the way to recovery. e. testing everyone to determine the percentage of the population exposed is epidemiologic testing and can be done with a representative sample. it is a waste of money to test more than you need. a proper sample for community-based testing of the entire philippines has been calculated to be as small 4,000 to 5,000 people. this is a far cry from doing 109,000,000 tests which is not necessary or advisable. if by mass testing we mean testing everyone who is at risk, then the government is already trying to do it and is paying for it. this is called enhanced targeted (massive) testing. a. this approach is the same approach that south korea and germany took. it is the same approach to which all the countries aspire. if you look at the world map in the first picture below, we are testing all patients with symptoms, which is a liberal approach compared with most countries in the world. in fact some lgus have been testing asymptomatics with exposure using rt-pcr. b. not a single country has used rapid antibody tests for determining clinical disease in patients. only rt-pcr is reliable enough to do this. the “mass testing” approach of south korea and singapore used rt-pcrs, and only in those at risk. none of them used antibody tests to detect clinical disease. c. the who recommends against using rapid antibody tests for clinical decision-making. it can be used for research and epidemiologic testing, but not to decide who is sick or not. this may change as we get better tests, but for now it is too risky and maybe even deadly to base policy on unreliable tests. 3. are we doing enough testing? isn’t more better? the who has pegged adequate testing as performing at least 10 tests for every one test that comes back positive. testing capacity has improved by leaps and bounds along with increasing healthcare facilities. currently we are doing about 16.3 tests for every 1 positive that comes back. that is better than the usa which is at 7.8 and nearly the same as germany which is at 18.6 (2nd picture below). as a third world country, we need to conserve our resources. doing too much testing will divert limited money that we can use for our social amelioration programs and economic stimulus packages. there is a global shortage of materials, and if we use up what we have too early, we won’t have any more materials to continue keeping track of the pandemic. this isn’t going to end anytime soon. we need to be efficient with testing and not overdo it to the detriment of our resources and future capacity. 4. what is the best test to clear people for work? the best test to clear people for work is to check them for symptoms. symptomatic covid-19 is responsible for >85% of transmission. the doh and psmid have already released guidelines to this effect and it is clear – no need to do laboratory testing to clear people for work. but what about the asymptomatic carriers? there is no good test to completely eliminate asymptomatic transmission. this is why we need to “covid-proof” the workplace with daily symptom checks, wearing of masks for everyone, physical distancing, handwashing and disinfection. neither rt-pcr nor antibody testing will pick up all your asymptomatics. 5. why do some private companies want to test their employees? and why won’t government pay for it? in my discussions with many private companies, a lot of them really want to do something to reassure their workforce that there is no covid-19 around. even if scientists tell them that rapid antibody tests are not good enough to rule out asymptomatic spread and even rt-pcrs can miss asymptomatic carriers, we realize that this may have a positive impact on the well-being of employers and employees. these companies say they are aware that the tests are imperfect, but they wish to proceed as they think this has some use – either from an epidemiologic perspective, or to boost workplace safety practices. doh and psmid recommendations are that this kind of testing is unnecessary and not cost effective. but since this is a free country, as long as you use a properly validated kit and the employees consent (they shouldn't be coerced into testing), then that is their call. companies will have to pay for testing outside usual parameters because the government cannot pay for testing that is not cost-effective or in line with current evidence. of course, if an employee develops symptoms, then rt-pcr will be paid for by the government according to doh and philhealth guidelines. there is also a private initiative to do serosurveys. this is a welcome effort because the government’s resources are being strained by many things. the private sector has been a major partner in the covid response and the country cannot thank them enough for continuing to pay worker’s salaries, giving tremendous ppe and laboratory material donations, and maintaining solidarity in tackling this problem. i hope this document clarifies things. we are all one big filipino family, and like all families we fight from time to time. i think in the end we all want to protect our loved ones from this virus, and the passion with which we are all trying to do the right thing sometimes lets us get carried away. we are only in the first round and the only way to win is to stick together and help each other out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/gnpazs/your_thoughts_on_this_statement_by_an/,21 05 2020
"A clarification on ""Mass testing"" shared by doctors on FB","the post in quotes below is from an edsel maurice salvana (physician, scientist, activist, ted fellow) according to his fb. also regards to today's statement by harry roque that i laughed at but actually may have more merit. spox has said that mass testing is the wrong term and that it should be ""expanded targeted testing"". but they seem to be doing a poor job of communicating this - apparently, we are \*already\* doing the mass testing people have been asking for and ""additional testing"" is optional for private companies. (why the hell doesn't he just say that?) anyway, thoughts? how legit is this? post is below. \- ""understanding testing for covid-19 – and why mass testing might not be what you think it is so much acrimony on proper testing for covid-19, when in fact i think everyone wants the same thing – enough testing to help us control the pandemic. testing is complicated, and just like the fable of the blind men and the elephant, anyone can spin a convincing tale of what should be done. but you need to look at the different aspects to see the big picture. it isn’t as simple as doing as many tests as we want and the problem will go away. it is doing the right test at the right time that will make a difference. 1. there are two types of testing: clinical testing and epidemiologic testing. clinical testing is when you test someone for a disease so you can treat them properly. for covid-19, the best test to determine whether someone is sick and is spreading virus is the rt-pcr. rt-pcr is best done on people who have just started having symptoms since rt-pcr detects the genetic material of the virus. if the virus is present in high enough quantities, the test will be positive. if rt-pcr is done too early or too late, it will not detect the virus and will be falsely negative. knowing this, doctors will look at a patient and label one a “probable case” even if the test is negative, if there is exposure and the clinical picture (fever, cough, pneumonia) is consistent with disease. that is why we test people with symptoms and also healthcare workers who are highly exposed. we act on the results of this individual test – isolate, trace and treat. epidemiologic testing is done to get a picture of the spread of a disease in the community. it may not change what you do with the individual patient, but it is a good guide to policy. this testing can be done with a reliable antibody test. testing everyone in a community is not needed, as a properly taken representative sample can give a good idea of what is going on in the community. the best antibody test for epidemiologic testing is a laboratory-based elisa because these are much more sensitive and specific than rapid antibody tests. sampling methodologies are really important to make sure that the sample you are getting is truly representative of the community spread of the virus. if you only test people with exposure (in contrast with clinical testing), it will give you a falsely high result. 2. what is mass testing, and is it feasible?

‘Root of all evil’: Quiboloy church’s demands for money mire followers in debt,"[‘root of all evil’: quiboloy church’s demands for money mire followers in debt dec 10, 2021 2:16 pm pht inday espina-varona, herbie gomez emil mercado](https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/investigative/quiboloy-church-demand-money-mires-kingdom-jesus-christ-followers-debt/?utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=echobox&utm_source=facebook&fbclid=iwar1srx76hk8aotlxqchjxcqreobipldk1hebq6g8uybwdhw7u87i-5ky35q#echobox=1639895468) pastor apollo quiboloy’s wealth is built on the heaving backs of his followers. the ‘children’ of his ‘kingdom’ are made to quit school or jobs, sell properties, and take out loans to meet quotas. they are punished when they fail to deliver, abandoned when they get sick. singapore-based worker reynita fernandez was only in grade 3 when she started immersion in the children’s department of pastor apollo quiboloy’s kingdom of jesus christ (kojc). her mother, a devoted member of the church, said nothing when 14-year-old reynita answered the call to be a full-time worker. the teenager and three jeepney loads of minors took a land and ferry trip from davao city, quiboloy’s base, to quezon city, where they were “packed like sardines” in a rented house. they spent an entire month soliciting funds from strangers, using the cover of several foundations to meet quotas. the shy fernandez learned to hop aboard buses to preach and beg. she even ended up in a cockfighting ring, scrabbling at dirt to collect money thrown by gamblers. “you really have this eagerness. we have to do this. i have to earn money. i have to go home with lots of money. i need to find some way,” she told rappler. arlene caminong stone, now based in minnesota in the us, was fernandez’s contemporary. she said they pretended to be orphans, sometimes deaf-mutes, determined to continue with schooling. the reality was the opposite. “i was in my third year of high school when they told me that i had to stop going to school because december was coming up and december was a big money-making month,” said stone. later, she was told to drop out of school. this was in 1991, stone remembered, and mount pinatubo in zambales had just erupted. “apollo quiboloy made a claim that it was the ultimate sign of the second coming. that’s why we have to leave our school, to leave our family. and join the ministry,” she said. meanwhile, fernandez, stressed out by impossible demands, ran away from the “kingdom” in 1998. “i didn’t get out because i saw something wrong. i felt i wasn’t worthy anymore. it’s because i couldn’t cope with the goal and the quota and everything financial,” she said. only then did fernandez realize how little she knew about the world after spending her formative years in a mental tunnel, where only orders mattered and church ministers viewed questions as the devil’s work. fernandez said escape was “liberating.” yet she kept the kojc faith, fearful of being cast into hell. she continued sending financial contributions for two decades. she tacked quiboloy’s face on her bedroom wall. the kojc welcomed her back into the fold in 2016, when she found work in singapore. then the old “nightmare” returned. she was ordered to lead one of several quiboloy fund-raising groups in singapore. kojc members, cans in hand, roamed crowded bukit timah, harbourfront, holland village, bishan market, serangoon, tampines, and jurong point, asking passersby for donations from 8 am to 8 pm daily. a member had to fill three cans a day. the contents of each can ranged from sg$300 (about p11,000 today) to sg$400 (about p14,700). she said kojc workers committed fraud fronting for kjc society in singapore. they applied for permits, but fudged reporting, declaring collections of only sg$20 (p735 today) or less each can. fernandez recalled that one of the kojc groups remitted to the philippines as much as sg$5,000 (about p184,501) for a week’s collections. it tried to evade the attention of singapore’s strict fiscal authorities by splitting the money into small batches, not more than sg$2,000 (p73,800) each. honolulu-based lawyer michael jay green, quiboloy’s chief legal counsel, called all the accusations “a bunch of nonsense,” even as he pinned all the blame on the former manager of the pastor’s aircraft fleet, a nepalese named shishir bhandari. green said bhandari, his filipino wife, and in-laws – ex-members of kojc who held key positions in the church – were behind quiboloy’s indictment, and they supposedly reached out to former members “around the world” to get them to say nasty things about the preacher. he alleged that everything was orchestrated by bhandari, his wife, and extended family after they supposedly flew out of the philippines when they learned that they were being audited by kojc. green alleged that bhandari then made a deal with the federal bureau of investigation (fbi) in an attempt to bring quiboloy and his church down. beasts of burden the “appointed son of god,” as quiboloy calls himself, was not content with tithes representing a tenth of the members’ income, the former members said. us-based former follower faith killion told rappler that every sunday service included calls for “love offerings” even bigger than the tithes. in singapore, fernandez gave sg$200 (p7,380) every month. like everyone else, she had to scramble to meet quotas for quiboloy’s april 25th birthday and the “month of blessing” (mob) – also called the “month of sacrifice.” it typically coincided with the christmas season as fund-raising usually began in the month of september. killion said there were offerings for the ministry for the poor, the television ministry, for the kojc’s publications, for concerts, for a stadium project in davao city, and an emergency fund. there were also “wave offerings” – cash in envelopes that members handed over as they danced to chirpy choir songs after the sermons. fernandez’s group was directed to raise sg$12,000 (about p442,800) for the mob. she had to deliver sg$500 (about p18,450) for quiboloy’s birthday; her group also had to turn over sg$2,500 (about p92,250) for the same event. those birthday gifts, and proceeds from the “tribute to the king mid-year sacrifice,” bought new homes and cars for the “appointed son of god.” in the us, quotas for the mob ranged from us$10,000 (over p503,000) to us$50,000 (over p2.52 million), depending on one’s financial status and ability to raise money, killion said. quiboloy’s wealth was built on the heaving backs of his followers. the children of the kojc labored like mules. unmet quotas were considered debts. they also led to harangues about one’s cursed soul. killion said members of her batch in manila woke up at 3 or 4 am for prayers. by 6 am, they were at their work areas. “we were not allowed to go home. it didn’t matter if it’s past midnight, until we met our individual quotas,” she said. fernandez and stone served together in the 1990s. stone said they dragged heavy loads of rice cakes in kidapawan and general santos, returning to davao only to shower and repack, snatching sleep on their jeepney shuttles. when an ailing fernandez appealed for a reprieve in singapore, she was brushed off. fernandez said she had to lose her house in the philippines, and hit a low of having no daily fare money, before she finally broke free. in hongkong, ex-”kingdom” member “fatima” and her group were once ordered to raise hk$300,000 (over p1.9 million) for an mob. when they failed to hit the target, they were berated as dumb and lazy, and told to make up for the shortfall the following year. the mob exacted grim attrition on members. students dropped out of school, employed members could find themselves jobless at the close of season. even the most loyal of followers get dumped when age and illness take their toll. killion left the kojc after 25 years of service, but her mother, a real estate broker who excelled in closing deals, stayed on as a full-time worker until she suffered a recent bout of illness. “all that she earned went to quiboloy’s group. before she got sick, she remitted p380,000 to the ‘kingdom,’” killion said. but when her mother suffered a stroke while working for the kojc, the devoted believer was left to shoulder her hospitalization and other medical costs. without her daughter, she would have died of hunger. groomed for exploitation quiboloy and his lieutenants allegedly groomed those targeted for exploitation, whether in davao, in the us, or in asian countries. stone, a former pastoral, survived beatings and domestic servitude to quiboloy in davao city. she left her pastoral duties and migrated to the us in 2004. (pastorals refer to privileged and attractive women who perform special tasks and do numerous errands for quiboloy as supposed forms of service to god.) a year after, a visiting quiboloy was showering stone with attention, including exclusive lunches. she was also exempted from the costs charged to lapsed members returning to the ministry, which killion placed at p50,000 (roughly $1,000). the church had done its homework. stone had by then married a pilot, who more than adequately provided for the family. she could afford to send her own income exclusively to the church. she sheltered and fed kojc workers, rented cars for them, and even paid us$18,000 (over p906,000) in accident damage costs as her “share of the kingdom’s work.” but quiboloy wanted more from stone: the services of her pilot husband and a return to davao city, where he promised free housing and education for her children. stone and her now ex-husband turned down the offer. after they divorced, she also turned down a request to marry a minister. then her mother got sick. stone asked to be spared contributions but ministers told her the ailment was punishment for defying quiboloy’s wishes. “that’s why i was cursed, that’s why my mom had to pay for it,” stone recalled them telling her. only then did she sever all ties to the church. “fatima” was also pampered, and was thus induced to begin using her funds to purchase food that she cooked and sold, turning over to the “kingdom” all proceeds and even capital. one sunday, she spent hk$1,000 (over p6,400). she took out a hk$30,000 loan (over p193,000) for the church. even her passport was pawned to raise funds for the kojc. but when church leaders told her to lie and borrow hk$10,000 (over p64,500) from her employer, fatima erupted and called it quits. ‘bogus charity work’ like fernandez, killion grew up in the church, soaking in the sermons of quiboloy, courtesy of her mother, a dedicated follower. at the age of 12, killion was out on the streets, soliciting. she later worked, part-time, for the church’s tri-media department, doing voiceovers and transcribing the preacher’s sermons. from that vantage point, she listed down through the years the many philippine groups the solicitors represented: * the children’s joy foundation incorporated * handog ng pagmamahal association incorporated * psalm of david harmonic orchestra incorporated * the sheavers association * alay sa may mga kapansanan association incorporated * pagdamay sa dukha association incorporated * pag-asa ng buhay association incorporated * pag-asa ng buhay foundation incorporated * life giver association incorporated * sonshine philippines movement * indigenous peoples innovation and yields for assured lives foundation incorporated (ipiyal) * the keepers club incorporated * batang kaharian * kingdom children growth school (kcgs) as of december 10, kcgs has no record of registration with the securities and exchange commission (sec). batang kaharian is a tv show produced by quiboloy church’s sonshine media network international (smni) under swara sug media corporation. the high-profile cfji has a main shelter for orphans and abandoned children in the church’s davao compound. occasionally, it organized children’s parties in davao, africa, and even in the us. in 2019, social welfare secretary rolando bautista gave the foundation the top award for non-governmental organizations during the department of social welfare and development’s panata awards. killion and the women who bolted from kojc, however, claimed children’s parties only happened “once in a blue moon,” usually coinciding with quiboloy’s birthday or other big kojc events when they would invite guests. the children in the davao facility were actually children of kojc workers, they added. these former believers want the government to probe into cfji’s operations, as us prosecutors have called it a bogus charity organization used as a front for alleged money laundering and sex trafficking operations. dark side of faith even as kojc members raised funds for the church, they were also the captive market for quiboloy relics: photographs, pieces of color-coded cloth soaked in oil, scented oil, handkerchiefs with embroideries of the preacher’s name, and prayer booklets. much like how the catholic church sells objects to help believers with their every need, the kojc marketed the quiboloy items as having supernatural powers for healing, protection, and prosperity. sociologist and ateneo de manila religion professor jayeel cornelio said quiboloy’s narrative of his latest dream has god declaring, “apollo, your name is my name and my name is your name.” that’s a jump to godlike status, no longer just the anointed but the divine anointing power. that, and his claim of being persecuted, can only increase pressure on kojc members to meet even the most unreasonable demands. the fear is mixed with the smugness of exceptionalism. identity generates pride. the stronger that is, the greater the anxiety over banishment. the stricter the church is, according to cornelio, the stronger it is from a sociological perspective. members face tough tests for acceptance. and leaving is much harder. – rappler.com",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/rk3lt5/root_of_all_evil_quiboloy_churchs_demands_for/,19 12 2021

"Help! UST, PLM, or MCU","hello po. i'm an incoming college freshie who's an aspiring doctor in the future. the three schools i mentioned are my current choices as for now. kinukuha na kasi ni dost kung ano ang school and course ko sa college (nakapasa din po ako sa dost s&t undergraduate scholarship). nag-exam din ako sa upcat but i'm not very confident na papasa ako dun saka wala pa rin ang upcat 2020 results. now, i'm torn kung saang school ba ako papasok. i wonder if you can give me your opinions naman po and help me decide :) update: i passed upcat 2020 po! bs nursing in upm. thank you po sa lahat ng responses! ust ~ honestly, i really want to go to school here. bs med tech po nilagay kong course, and i was able to thankfully pass. if ever dito ako papasok, i will be able to enjoy a 100% scholarship daw kasi i graduated shs as rank 1. kaya lang i am worried kasi baka hindi ko ma-maintain ang scholarship ko. kung sakaling mangyari yun, mahihirapan kami since i come from a low-income household. i wish i could say na 'i'll try my best and surely i can finish my pre-med course without spending too much' but i feel that that would be too idealistic since 'di ko naman alam kung sino ba mga makikilala ko dun at kung ano mga mangyayari once mag-aral na ako. also, marami rin ang nag-aadvice sa akin na 'wag mag ust kasi mahirap daw ang byahe at lagi daw baha kapag rainy season. plm ~ plm is quite a complicated case for me. nakapasa kasi ako kaso ngayon ko lang naalala na bs bio pala ang nilagay kong first course dun. e naipasa ko siya. akala ko talaga nursing ang first course ko pero di pala!

'di naman nakakatulong mga pinagtatanungan ko kasi ang sinasabi nila sakin kung san ko daw gusto pumasok, dun daw ako. as if naman ganun lang kadali yun, i have to consider all the consequences, the pros and the cons, 'di ba? kung binabasa niyo pa rin po 'to, thank you po sa time niyo at sana po mabigyan niyo po ako ng opinion niyo. salamat po!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/grjxs5/help_ust_plm_or_mcu/,27 05 2020

Covid positive here. Could any fellow positives share how you think you got Covid? I think it would help others be more careful. In my case I think I got infected at a barber shop.,"i am certain i got covid from a barbershop. i went to get a haircut on the 31st and all the barbershops were closed except for one. there was a barber who was coughing. a lot. he was cutting the hair of an unmasked older gentleman who didnt seem to mind. the barber told me to sit down because he will be done shortly with cutting the hair of the older person then it would be my turn. i should have walked out. normally i avoid people coughing but i thought it didnt matter as this was the 31st - before news of the big surge. i also thought that the barber was coughing due to the cold weather. i didn't walk out. instead i had my haircut by another barber in the same shop. i hope the older guy is okay. :-( i'm fully vaxxed with astrazeneca and boostered with moderna. edit: and i have flu vaxx too. as for me i'm ok - no more colds,- slight cough with sore throat - isolating right now. 02 sats never dropped below 97 although i had a nonstop runny nose for four days. it's the worst i've ever had in my life. can you guys please share how you think you got covid? i think it would help others be more careful.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/rx1xu7/covid_positive_here_could_any_fellow_positives/,6 01 2022

On our PNP frontliners...,"my tito posted this on facebook. ~~~~~~~~~~~ two cases just told to me by a psychiatrist friend working at the pnp hospital. last night a cop called the er that he had a gun to his head because he feared he might have infected his wife and newborn child after forgetting to disinfect himself upon end of his tour of duty. he says he totally forgot because he had been up for 72 hours. the er sent a team to his house and talked him over. apparently his wife didn’t know what he was going thru. he had been sleeping outside their apartment in the garage and had used their common bath area where some baby supplies are stored, hence his sudden anxiety and discombobulation. the other comes from a former subordinate who reached out to my friend because he believes he has the coronavirus which he might’ve contracted through his boss who is now also positive. he has had no testing done yet but he reports coughing fits and soreness of throat. he is now a pui. he has a wife and five kids. he believes he will die without seeing them or knowing what happened because he’s here in ncr and they are in bicol. he has not told them anything about it. he seemed disturbed and incoherent so my friend had to talk him down about his being infected. after all this, i now also fear my friend has become anxious and depressed from what she has been through and this was only last night. she’s now also a frontliner having been involved in assessing personnel psychiatric conditions among frontliners in the police. she and another psychiatrist are just two allowed to assess our police. that’s like 1 for every 12,000 policemen here in ncr alone. i can imagine the strain she has to go through.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ftk86z/on_our_pnp_frontliners/,2 04 2020
The special ̶p̶o̶w̶e̶r̶s̶ ̶o̶f̶ ̶ Koko Pimentel,"by his own admission, he was on self-quarantine: “i quarantined myself since march 11, 2020, and already tried to limit my movements.” his wife’s own words: “he had been in quarantine for weeks in a separate bedroom.” (n.b. “for weeks”) let’s be somber and check how the koko pimentel's fare vis-à-vis the following filipinos in similar circumstances: a 60-year-old man in caloocan died last saturday because the injudiciously planned lockdown prevented him from getting transport to his dialysis sessions. his thrice-weekly dialysis was his only chance to live a productive life, but he had lost access to the treatment. in just a week of lockdown, his body had bloated. he died of kidney failure. ~~but for koko and his wife, they had the privilege to forum-shop for hospitals. denied at one hospital, they proceeded to makati medical center.~~ the brothers gerald and mark libiran are both in the health care frontlines. gerald is an aide at the philippine orthopedic center who works 10 hours a day, three times a week. mark, his brother, works at the national children’s hospital where he had just completed four days straight duty. the brothers were on a motorcycle to take the two-hour ride to their santa maria, bulacan home. with no public conveyances, that was their only way to reach home and rest for the next hospital duty. they were flagged down for violating the prohibition on back rides, despite showing work identification cards. “my heart sunk when i learned that the penalty was p5,000. that’s half of my salary for the month,” said gerald. ~~but for the pimentels, the license plates of a senator’s car facilitate ease of entry, plus other support vehicles for bodyguards.~~ the 69-year-old homeless dorothy espejo sleeps on the pavements of malate. she was apprehended by law enforcers, booked at the police station for a mug shot and charged with resistance to authority. but to where could a destitute itinerant have gone home? a home for dorothy is the government’s solution. ~~the arresting police instead told her they needed to set an example. yet for koko, the justice secretary was quick to say, “the doj will temper the rigor of the law with human compassion.”~~ koko said his self-quarantine started march 11, the last day of the senate sessions. we all know the senate became pestilent after a committee hearing resource person had later tested positive. we go by his own account that led to his self-quarantine: march 14 he started having body pains and flu symptoms; he then slept in a room separate from his wife; march 18 he had a 38-degree fever and sore throat. he was correct for following the protocol that as a person under monitoring (he came from a risk area, he manifested the symptoms), self-quarantine was required. let’s be redundant to take his word for it: he tried to limit his movements and slept in a separate bedroom. on march 16, five days after his self-imposed quarantine, he went shopping ~~at the membership club s&r at bonifacio global city. he checked out at counter 13 at 1:59 p.m. he breached his home quarantine protocol. he lied.~~ cctv cameras did not. grocery workers are frontliners, too, for being at the receiving end of viral risk. when koko’s test came out on march 24, s&r bgc had to quarantine those within contagious distance of the ~~self-quarantined-but-lied~~ former senate president. the homeless dorothy espejo is in jail but not koko ~~who did not use his kokote~~. dr. israel bactol and others who succumbed but got their positive test results only after they had died is not pardonable ~~when the marcos family got theirs in only a day~~. in a pandemic of chasm between the rich and the poor, the defenseless perish first. ~~koko pimentel and a government with no compulsion to protect its citizens have just prescribed the recipe for mass panic and mass contagion. bong go can go breach the metro manila quarantine again when a fire breaks out in another city like he did in butuan city~~. ~~mediocrities of haughty entitlements and militarism to solve a medical crisis?~~ strikethrough all vip entitlements. &#x200b; written by: **by:** [antonio montalvan ii](https://twitter.com/antoniojmontal2?s=20)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/frzete/the_special_powers_of_koko_pimentel/,30 03 2020
What does Albularyo do (witch doctor/folk healer)? Do they really do something? May naniniwala pa ba sa kanila in this generation?,"so i have a brother, he's 25 year old. we rushed him twice in the hospital this week. pero prior pa sa mga episodes na'to, he's feeling symptoms already eg. tightness of chest, nagka-cramps ang katawan niya, difficulty sleeping, nahihirapan huminga, etc. after all the medical exams, okay naman lahat ng results niya, normal lahat ng test. a friend of his advised him to go to albularyo (which i am against kasi i think he's having mental health problems talaga which affects he's overall being since yung mga symptoms niya ay linked to anxiety and depression eg. panic attacks/difficulty breathing). but i just let them para sa peace of mind na rin na atleast we all did everything possible kahit na talagang kapos kami, we just don't want him to feel na pinapabayaan namin siya. so fastforward kung saan pumunta yung albularyo sa bahay, wala naman siyang masyadong ginawa. may sinabi na may lumalaro raw sa kapatid ko (nangkukulam daw sa kanya), mas marami pa actually yung pagboboast niya na he's done something for someone, na siya yung reason kung bakit nalaman kung sino yung kumuha sa wallet ng isa niyang pasyente (?). he's just engaging us in the conversation. he also said na yung mga ibibigay niyang papakuluan at iinumin ay exported pa raw and such. and to my surprise p4000 lahat yung siningil niya for that session only. he's not the typical albularyo rin, naka-car siya and mukha namang well-off. do you think reasonable yun as bayad? i mean, may mga naririnig naman na akong albularyo before pero usually hindi ganun kalaki ang hinihingi nila. since parang act of altruism yon in their part since meron silang god-given gift. i don't have anything against sa mga albularyo or naniniwala/nagpeperform nga mga ganoong rituals pero i felt robbed for me and sa kuya ko kasi we chipped in sa bayad. malaking bagay na yon para samin, he's living paycheck to paycheck and i'm still reviewing for my boards so big deal talaga yun sakin. and if ever may magtanong kung bakit hindi ko na lang sinuggest na magvisit ng psychologist. it is still not acknowledge sa amin, especially sa pamilya namin. and simply not accessible. (how can i put it into words) parang still stuck sa phase na ""nasa isip mo lang yan."" bottomline, are albularyos a thing? am i just overreacting sa bayad? edit: i'm reading all your comments guys and i really appreciate them. pero hindi ko lahat ma-process right now kasi my manung just talked to the albularyo, and he's asking him 5k kasi may ritual daw silang gagawin bukas and he's gonna bathe him with god knows what and how, at hindi pa sure kung yun na yung last na hihingin niya. and he assured him daw na 'pag 'di gumaling, ibabalik daw yung binayad. i really can't process anything right now kasi i'm thinking na baka this is only the beginning nung mga paghingi hingi niya, and knowing my brother he really won't listen to any of us. edit: please don't share this with any platform update: i took your advice guys and told him na he should instead see a therapist since malaking bagay yung hinihinging 5k. i also forwarded informative videos na very similar sa mga symptoms na nafifeel niya na linked to anxiety. unfortunately, umutang daw siya ng pambayad and binayaran na niya. and he won't acknowledge yung idea na maybe he has anxiety. sobrang close minded niya with regards doon. i'll just hope and pray for the placebo effect.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/17nhpid/what_does_albularyo_do_witch_doctorfolk_healer_do/,4 11 2023

Taxi Spray Modus but this time sa Grab?,"hi! just want to ask if anyone here has experienced the taxi spray modus pero this time sa grab? gusto ko lang i-verify kung nauuso na naman siya because i experienced it again tonight. so i went to makati and decided to use grab to go home. i asked kuya na mag skyway na lang para mas mabilis. the trip was initially okay but started to be scary when i noticed he kept on touching a mini container with liquid hung up together with his rosary. napansin ko na ginagawa nya yun kapag nagpho-phone ako. i didn't pay attention pa rin masyado kasi akala ko may mga simbahan kaming nadadaanan that's why he kept on touching it. plus this is grab so yung tiwala ko was really high. on the third time na nakita kong he touched the container, i started feeling different na. by this time i had difficulty breathing, heartbeat was faster, started feeling disoriented and my mouth and throat started feeling dry. still i was convincing myself na wala lang normal lang pero iba na talaga eh. i opened the window kasi nga parang ang hirap na huminga but it was of little help. what i did was i asked him na ibaba ako. here's the part na talagang naiyak ako. kuya went down (na-realize siguro nya yung eksena ko), asked me na sumakay ulit and told me ""ma'am balik na po kayo. pabango lang po yun. itatapon ko na po kung gusto nyo. pulis po may-ari ng grab. kahit kausapin nyo po siya. i was like — he fucking knew it. without me saying anything about that fucking container. he knew it. i told kuya ""no kuya. i feel unsafe sa sasakyan mo."" and then i started walking sa skyway deadma na sa mga sasakyan. walked hanggang toll exit and i was ugly crying na while talking to my friend and doon na yung blurry part. patrol cars, more ugly crying while talking to my sisters, being scared to go home and for my family's life kasi baka balikan ako dahil alam nya address ko. ending i wrote a letter na hindi ako magco-complain sa grab and police kasi ayoko talaga ng hassle at gulo. (++disoriented na ako and naiisip ko lang talaga was what if balikan ako) sobrang panic ko, dinedelete ko grab ko, deactivated my facebook, trying to remove my public pictures sa linkedin. my friend then picked me up. ang lala. still can't sleep because of the trauma. sabi nung taxi na sinakyan namin pabalik ng makati, may mga pampatulog daw talaga na ganun and he asked me if the driver's window was slightly open. honestly di ko na napansin yun kasi nga i was busy with my phone so ayun.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/u0o8dw/taxi_spray_modus_but_this_time_sa_grab/,10 04 2022

Are work/medical/repair reimbursements enough or is there a fixed amount to receive for injury claims?,"tl;dr, i was hit by a speeding auv while crossing an intersection with my bike on the way home. curious of how injury claims go into process against the car driver. not looking to have them jailed. tuesday, april 25, 1:30pm last week was going great — day off spent well, watching nba playoffs, ordered food for me and my grandma and then i biked to 7/11 nearby. quick store run, as usual. pauwi na to eat lunch. did my honest highway pagtawid etiquette, only to be hit by an auv which came behind a slow-paced 16-wheeler a bit over 20meters far from the intersection. his speed was i think around 40 kph, more or less. i took the brunt force and fell back-first. my bike flew as well, together with my 7/11 paper bag containing snack and soda. my glasses, shattered. if i had my phone with me, it’d prolly have a cracked screens and cameras by now(i left it at home knowing i’ll only be away for ~5 minutes) 1:43 pm there were a lot of bystanders who rushed to help. i got off the road and the driver pulled roadside while i was regaining my senses. multiple abrasions, but i felt like i can go home. i wanted to go home and just cry alone for having been able to experience that accident when everything was going so well for the day. bystanders were asking me to get to the hospital but i was feeling all the anxiety and adrenaline hence i declined at first. the driver and his wife said they’ll have to be somewhere asap and they’ll just call me for compensation after they finished their “appointment”. seeing that they’re both at around the same age as my grandma, i softened and just told them off trusting that they’ll come and contact me back. we exchanged numbers and we got their plate number, only to be declined their driver’s license info(still trying to catch my breath at this point and while the bystanders took initiative to ask them, they refused. i know it’s their right too tho) 4:00 pm my aunt took action later in the day since we’re receiving no response from the driver’s side, and i’m glad we took it to the authorities. i was tasked by the local gvt police to get a medico-legal check up and x-ray, to see the extent of my injuries. results showed i only sustained multiple abrasions(sugat) and my muscles took all the hit — basically, bukod sa mga sugat at gasgas sa katawan, nabugbog ako nang malala. i’m not looking to have the driver jailed for negligence of compensation but rather i only wanted to make sure he won’t run awayy. we’re about to request a subpoena(police investigator and hospital physician schedules made it delayed til this point) for injury claims. i’m not used to this kind of conflict, and i’m an engineering graduate so i don’t get how legal process works especially for road accidents. edit: physically i feel a bit better now, thanks to painkillers and muscle relaxants. still having shortness of breath and relapses which can be a bit traumatic. i got back to my work recently too, since i’m wfh anyways.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/135vp4q/are_workmedicalrepair_reimbursements_enough_or_is/,2 05 2023

Clearing up misconceptions about 2019-nCoV,"yesterday, during the parents' plenary in lpu, i've had the honor of listening to prof. oliver dumaoal's briefing on ncov - and i would like to give him credit for doing an incredible job of explaining to parents and students about the situation of this newfound virus. with that being said, and as a sci-tech editor of my school paper, here's my attempt to explain everything he said in hopes to change everyone's perspective of novel coronavirus. what is this? 2019 novel coronavirus (connoted as ncov) is a virus outbreak that apparently originated from wuhan, china. as the newest addition to the coronavirus family (sars-cov and mers-cov are its ""older"" siblings), it possesses some traits similar to the previous viruses. according to the centers for disease control and prevention, its symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. once infected, these symptoms will appear between 2 to 14 days. but most of the confirmed cases have shown that it takes longer times before these symptoms appear. currently, there is no particular cure for the virus. its symptoms, however, are a different story. according to reports, most people become asymptomatic when they're prescribed with medicine for the symptoms (paracetamol, the most commonly used drug used to treat fever, helps patients with ncov deal with fever and thus become asymptomatic after a few days.) how do you get infected? a person carrying this virus, according to statistics, can infect 2 people on average. numerous risk assessments and other statistics have shown that compared to the number of people infected by measles, you are much less likely to be infected by ncov. an explanation for this would be the transmission of the virus. ncov isn't an airborne virus: it can only be transmitted via body fluids (coughing, sneezing, and transmission of saliva.) simply put, a person cannot be infected easily by the virus, especially by breathing in public places. a person can only be infected if he is in close contact with the virus, if he touches something contaminated by the infected person's sneeze or coughs, or if an infected person sneezes on another person. on note of hygiene however, a person is vulnerable or at risk of being infected if the person does not practice proper hygiene. although the risk of being infected is relatively low, it significantly decreases if a person washes his hands regularly and properly. surgical masks are excellent in preventing airborne diseases, and it helps in decreasing the risk of getting infected; however, this isn't necessary for countries like the philippines, since there are only a few suspected cases of the virus. additionally, the best method of preventing yourself from being infected would be washing your hands thoroughly and regularly. should i get checked? there are few criteria for being checked for the virus. if a person has close contact with an infected person, if the person has contacted an infected person's body fluids, or if you have been to the province of hubei (particularly in the city of wuhan) in the past week or month, then it is best to get checked for the virus. however, if you answered ""no"" to the criteria mentioned, then there is no need to be alarmed. the public outcry for novel coronavirus has been misinterpreted: your risk of getting infected is low, its symptoms can be easily cured, and it is easily preventable. what's more, the ratio of people dying to the virus to the number of confirmed cases of infection is low (as of 31 january 2020, 213 have died while 9826 are confirmed to have the virus, a 1:50 ratio of deaths to confirmed cases.) we can never be too safe with this virus. although the posed threat for the virus is blown out of proportion, there's no harm in washing your hands more often to prevent the virus from spreading. stay safe, wash your hands more often, and be vigilant. sources: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019 https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200131-sitrep-11-ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=de7c0f7_2 https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/risk-assessment-pneumonia-wuhan-china-22-jan-2020.pdf",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ex2ory/clearing_up_misconceptions_about_2019ncov/,1 02 2020
I think I'm losing everything.,"(first time doing this and writing on reddit to express how i feel, so bear with me.) pandemic and recent election period really take a toll in my well being. i was in a 6yr relationship and it is really weird and complicated. we tried to avoid topics such as beliefs and politics. but recently (as i always did naman since 2016 pa), i decided to stand up and fight and be vocal for what i think is morally right. to cut it short, she belongs to a religion which just recently endorsed the corrupt and the thieves. so, we call it quits a while back pa and cut off our communication because i know she would follow their so called 'unity voting'. as of now, i'm trying to be productive and focus on things that really matters. pero still you know, bad news, surveys and mostly disinformation on other social platforms gives us more anxiety and make me lose hope. aside from politics and relationship, my career and family is next on the line. i'm now resigning for my current work to pursue better career opportunity and going back to my parents' home to work remotely. problems are, i cannot focus well and breathe freely around my father alam niyo yon? he's a loyalist and i feel terribly sad he was enslaved by fake news peddlers for years now ever since that boi b/b/m lost in 2016. i sometimes took the blame or like it's my responsibility to help them not consume fake news because i work in it industry and i somehow know how information or mostly disinformation spreads on facebook and youtube. i tried to explain to them about their data and fb ads, cam/bridge analy/tica and all those 2016 election fiasco. i feel like i was fool while telling those things to them. also, the reason i wanna go back home is i wanna be with my mother ever since she worked abroad as ofw, she recently came home for good. so i thought, gusto ko makabawi sa panahon na wala siya and when i needed a mother in my side when i'm really down and longing for a mother's touch. but yea it's hard to go home. i'm also thinking about moving on to different place again and not move back to my parents' since i am living independently rin naman ngayon. but you know, living alone also took a toll on my head for years now. i cannot sleep well at night, i sometimes procrastinate and play games until 2-3am. i had lost my enthusiasm on the things i'm really good at. my 2018-2019 me is better than what i am right now. it affects my career and my skills and just struggling today. so it bugs me a lot on where to go and where to start. so ayon, i feel like i'm losing everything. i'm losing her again and again because of me fighting for democracy. i don't know where to go and i feel like i don't belong in anywhere as of now. i'm losing myself and still trying to figure things out. lahat ng yon, there's this small hope and faith inside me, for our fellow citizen. kahit ang hirap hirap and we feel like we're alone in this battle. internet communities, m04d, all those wholesome/bardagulan kakampinks fb pages and etc. i'm still holding onto hope. next time na magsusulat ako dito hopefully, i'll be writing some good news na. salamat sa pagbasa nito at nakaabot ka pa dito. para sa pilipinas. 🌸",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/uinzvl/i_think_im_losing_everything/,5 05 2022
Tips for Pinoy Parents Having a Hard Time in Academics with their Kids,"hi! ang tagal ko nang gustong i-post to and i do hope na suwak pa rin naman siya for r/ph standards. with the reports of the philippines having one of the worst performing students in the world, gusto ko sana tumulong sa mga parents na hirap na hirap sa mga anak nila. for context, i am a personal tutor and have taught more than 20 students pre and post k-12 shift, from kinder 2 to grade 9. nakapagturo na rin ako both public and private schools. although hindi ako educ graduate, i can proudly say na may mga naturuan na akong bata na napunta sa section 1 at tumaas ang grades. yung mga parents na hirap sa anak nila dahil pasaway at tamad ay nagawan ko ng paraan. so feeling ko naman may credibility ako to give out these tips. one of my previous jobs rin is to read people and evaluate their attitude and persona kaya kaya kong ma-gauge ang mga bata at kaya ko sila ma-set for learning. these tips should cover the typical gen-z kid. please keep in mind lang na depende pa rin talaga sa bata kung ano ang gagawin ninyo. 1) limit their gadget usage habang baby pa - madalas kasi sa mga parents ay gadgets agad ang takbuhan para sumunod at makinig ang mga anak nila. parang go to na lang ang gadgets for parents if gusto nila tumino ang bata. trust me on this, hindi maganda na bata pa lang ay excessively exposed na agad sila sa gadgets. nagiging addicted sila dito at nagiging dependent. dito rin kasi nag-roroot yung tantrums nila. if hindi mapigilan, try to limit their use by 1 hour per day and make sure na talagang nasusunod ang schedule nila. 2) check the content that they are consuming - one reason why some kids grow up lacking skill in filipino (in short, englishero ang anak) is because of what they watch. dahil puro peppa pig, wolfie, ryan's toy review, at kung ano pa ang kinalakihan nila and they rarely watch tagalog shows ay humihina ang kanilang tagalog vocabulary. minsan naman ay kaya mahina sila sa english ay dahil mga walang salita ang pinapanuod nila or sobrang limited lang ng words na ginagamit. good example here is yung larva na animated series, streamers na paulit-ulit ang sinasabi, and those flash animation sa yt. ensure that your kids have the balance mix of english and tagalog content. one good way to introduce them to the english language is by letting them watch cartoons from nick or cartoon network (na madalas makikita sa yt). kung tagalog naman ay hayaan silang manuod nung mga oldies shows tulad ng hiraya, sineskwela, bayani, team yey, etc. 3) when studying and teaching your kids, make sure na kita nilang seryoso kayo at hindi kayo nakatutok sa phone - i asked one of my students before kung bakit hindi siya natuto magsulat ng name niya. ang sagot niya is because yung parent niya na nagtuturo ay hindi siya tinututukan nang maayos dahil nakatutok ito sa phone. if you are going to teach your kids, make sure na tutok kayo sa kanila, no gadgets and no other disturbance dapat. kung nagsusulat sila ay tignan niyo yung sinusulat nila. minsan kasi kaya sila hesitant to learn and absorb yung lessons is because nakikita nilang hindi tayo kaseryoso at katutok sa kanila. 4) make sure they get enough sleep ngayong pasukan - another common problem na napapansin ko sa mga bata ngayon ay yung kakulangan sa tulog. nagugulat na lang ako knowing that yung ibang bata ay natutulog ng 11pm at yung iba naman ay 3am pa. lack of sleep leads to slow learning. alam naman nating lahat na kapag antok tayo ay hirap tayo makapagfocus. to combat this, make sure na nakakakuha sila ng tulog na maayos. at least dapat 9pm ay tulog na sila. kung sobrang bata rin sila ay patulugin sila nang hapon. this will not only improve their focus, but it would also help them strengthen their immune system which helps them avoid common sicknesses. 5) iwasan ang physical discipline hanggat maaari - iba na ang mga bata ngayon. hindi katulad nang dati na nadadaan pa tayo sa mga palo, ngayon kahit titigan mo na ang mga bata ay tutuloy-tuloy pa rin sila. based on my observation, mas bastos na talaga ngayon ang mga bata at mas matigas ang ulo. hindi na umuubra sa kanila ang palo-palo. hindi rin nakakatulong ang palagiang pagpalo sa kanila dahil later on they will just accept their fate kung lagi sila napapalo. repetitive disciplinary actions do not discipline kids. mas maayos pa rin kung kakausapin natin sila nang mahinahon habang bata pa lang. imbes na paluin agad, ipaliwanag kung bakit mali ang kanilang ginawa at kung ano ang epekto nito sa kanila kung pagpapatuloy nila ang mali nilang gawain. 6) kumuha ng tutor kung kaya - maraming nagsasabi sa aking parents na they feel sorry for those other parents na walang tutor dahil given how poor our educational system, hindi sapat ang turo ng school sa mga bata. find someone fitting sa anak ninyo pero huwag rin naman takutin ang mga bata. do not use sentences like ""sige ka kapag hindi ka sumunod ikukulong ka ng teacher/tutor mo."" dahil lalong matatakot ang bata. kung kaya rin ay kumuha nang tutor na hindi nila teacher para magkaroon ng separation from their school environment. mas nakakarefresh kasi ang bata kapag ibang tao na wala sa school nila ang nagtuturo nila. 7) find your kid's strengths as well - minsan kasi ay nakafocus ang parents sa academics and overall grades kaya na-iignore ang ibang aspects ng mga bata kung saan sila nag-eexcel. minsan, sobrang na-dodown na sila dahil sa lagi nating pag-iinsist na tumaas ang grades nila kaya hindi nadedevelop ang kanilang ibang skills. hindi lahat ng bata ay above average ang skills nila sa basic subjects such as math, english, at filipino pero madalas sa ibang subjects sila nag-eexcel like art, ap, esp, etc. find them and i-nurture ang subjects na iyon. and then once na tumaas ang confidence nila sa sarili nila ay kakayanin na nila mag-exert ng extra effort sa ibang subjects na hirap sila. 8) make them appreciate books and reading at a very young age - bata pa lang ay bilhan na sila ng mga libro at basahan sila kahit pa baby pa lang. maraming mga stores na kung saan may murang bilihan ng kid friendly books. once you start them early, makukuha nila ang love nila sa pagbabasa and it will be benifitial kapag tumanda na sila. we all know that althroughout our academic years ay maraming libro ang ating pagdadaanan, and if your kids are love reading ay madali lang nila mapag-aaralan at ma-rereview ang kanilang lessons. 9) give them conditional rewards and punishment - one common mistake that parents make kapag nakikipagnegotiate with their kids is that they usually give what i call ""100-0"" conditions. example nito ay whenever they want their kids to study, ang sasabihin nila ay ""mag-aaral ka o hindi? kung mag-aaral ka makakapagcomputer ka, pero kung hindi wala kang computer!"" which makes yung computer their bargaining chip, and the next time mag-aaral sila ay dapat laging kasama ito sa options, or hindi na sila gagalaw. make it conditional to the point na hindi ma-eencourage pa rin ang bata to give his/her best. instead, tell them ""if mag-aral ka, i'll give you 1 hour of extra gadget time, pero tuloy pa rin tayo sa schedule natin okay? if hindi mo gawin, hindi mo makukuha yung 1 hour extra gadget time mo, gusto mo ba yun?"" make it sound like the better option is way better talaga. 10) when there is tension, move back and give each other some break time - this is very crucial and effective kapag may hindi nakukuha yung mga tinuturuan ko. if there's this simple task/question/problem na hindi niya magawa (good example would be when they can't follow the carry-over or borrow sa math, or when they can't draw a line properly when writing big letter d,) much better if you give both 5 mins of breathing time. mas hindi kasi makukuha nang bata kung puro iyak at pilit na lang. do inhale-exhale exercises 10 times until mag-calm daw siya (and ikaw) and then ituro ulit. marami pa ako actually na tips pa pero i don't really know if lalabas to sa subreddit. you can ask me personally through dm and i'll answer them as best as i can.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/wqkegp/tips_for_pinoy_parents_having_a_hard_time_in/,17 08 2022

Beggars in the Philippines,"i see some comments about beggars to not give them anything and this triggers me to share this story of my brother turned begging to the streets because he ran away from batangas my aunts house and hitched trucks to get to gensan which is in mindanao where my mother lives. very far right? it's truly better to give food rather than money in many situations. pero don’t say na wag na magbigay sa kanila even food, tao din naman sila nagugutom. so yun nga, my younger brother once got lost in manila during the pandemic. it took months before we found him. he ended up begging on the streets, and people gave him money and food. sadly, he developed mental health issues. actually, before he left home he told us that he has anxiety and we didn’t know and it’s the beginning na pala of him having a real mental issue. we're from general santos city, where manny pacquiao is from. my mother let my brother, who was 16 at the time, to stay with my aunt in batangas to attend school with my 14-year-old sister due to my mom struggle raising 8 kids as a single mom and btw single factory lang kami. my brother was passionate about working out and aspired to be a boxer. he used a workout app, jogged every day at 5 am, and even influenced our neighbors' kids to exercise. they ended up going to the gym for free and had the chance to meet some local boxers. my brother was handsome, light skinned and really has good appearance and his body is really nice since he is working out. his teeth were so white and no damages. and people are very curious why he end up begging to the streets but whenever people talks to him he talks intelligently or maturely like mapapatanong ka na “why this kid knows so much better about life” but it was off topic and he doesn’t wanna share about his family whenever he was asked about it and the reason behind why he end up in the streets. (we saw some videos of people talking to him which was sent to us via fb) even he doesn’t shower since he turned into a beggar with mental illness, he has good skin complexion na parang dirty ivory skin look kahit exposed sya sa sun. pero naliligo naman daw sya if umuulan. sya talaga yung nag iisang kapatid namin na maputi talaga at kung matablan man ng araw ang skin nya from beach, bumabalik yung kulay nya. so back to the story, my brother ran away from my aunt’s home because they wouldn't let him go outside due to his age. minors weren't allowed to go outside during the pandemic, and they added sleeping pills to his soft drinks to prevent him from attempting to go outside. he just wanna go outside because he wanna go jogging. he knows very well na bawal talaga minor sa labas pero he keeps insisting. addicted talaga sa workout workout thingy na. they would let my brother drunk softdrinks everyday pero plot twist everyday din nilalagyan ng sleeping pills :<. when my brother notices na kung bakit sya nakakatulog na ayaw naman nya, this makes him leave my aunt’s home (my mom’s older sister). he doesn’t trust any drinks or food he ate at that house. so he ran away without money or anything and managed to hop onto the back of a truck, which happened to travel from batangas to manila. his goal is to go home to gensan but it was a failure. fortunately, he wasn't hurt during this journey, and no one harmed him in manila. we were very worried about his safety, fearing that someone might kidnap him or exploit him for labor or worse. i'm grateful for those who helped my brother in manila. despite his mental illness and traumatic experiences in batangas, he still managed to use a computer at internet shops to reach out to us via facebook. but my work schedule at a call center made it difficult for me to be online when he was. when we finally found his location, i took a 5-day emergency leave from work, and my mom and i flew to manila. we coordinated with the local barangay office in parañaque, with the help of a former neighbor who worked there. this experience completely changed my perspective on beggars. it's not as simple as saying, ""why don't you find a job?"" not all beggars are the same; some are struggling with mental health issues or are lost and trying to survive. i am deeply thankful to the people who helped my brother, even though i couldn't share the whole story on facebook because my other brother felt it was humiliating for our family and thought i just wanted to become fb famous daw. so, i personally messaged everyone who assisted and helped us, including the kind internet shop owner as well the people who are members of inc who helped us as my mother is inc. we are so thankful to the head of police na ka-iglesia as he was just one call away and action agad because without him, it would be very slow process to help find my brother too because at that time, nung nasa manila kami he escaped during madaling araw in the place where we stay at as my mom is supposed to check on him during night time and ako naman during daytime na magbabantay - but they were able to find him naman and put him into social workers. but at that time, we already went home with my mom because we were draining money and we couldn’t find him right away even with the help of the street cctv. we spend the money traveling + food and it’s hella expensive pa naman sa manila when you are just commuting at di mo alam ang lugar. we left because my mom is a single mom and she still has little kids at home waiting for her. that is why we are not able to stay longer. while me i have work and obligations as well. it is painful but we have to. (no judgement please) so then social workers helped my brother to get home, and cebpac was so kind to help my brother as well as yung flight ticket for him was already a no-show and they let him still in the plane. writing this still makes me cry so hard. it is very painful.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/17ir0ve/beggars_in_the_philippines/,29 10 2023
NPA are RUTHLESS,"this is random topic but i have to share it to y'all. my bestfriend just texted me last night that his mother and 4 other people were killed by the npas'. they were shot and what's worst is that they burned the house down along with the dead bodies. i always knew that npas' are ruthless pero di ko inakala na ganito ka baboy ang kanilang ginawa. he couldn't even have a proper burial for her. hindi man lang sya nakapagpaalam even for one last time. he was miles away from his family. he is all alone now stuck in his apartment. i couldn't even visit him because of the virus. what he's going through right now is a lot and he's in excruciating pain. i'd like to ask for some prayers for him please, it'd mean so much to me and to him. sana lng magkaroon ng hustisya.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/i4ixvy/npa_are_ruthless/,6 08 2020
Summary TLDR of answers to the most asked questions about Sinovac and Vaccines in last night's AMA.,"[https://www.reddit.com/r/philippines/comments/lw0grz/ama\_i\_am\_an\_hcw\_who\_received\_their\_first\_dose\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/philippines/comments/lw0grz/ama_i_am_an_hcw_who_received_their_first_dose_of/) did not expect to get asked this many questions last night in my ama. was expecting maybe 100 posts max and i would end up doing it until around 12, but i was still answering questions until 1am and had to answer mga pahabol questions in the morning pagka gising. buti nalang wfh ako and may oras sumagot ng mga additional questions. however pansin ko lang din that a lot of questions get repeatedly asked, which really says that certain issues with vaccines are more common than we previously thought of. so for this i'll repost the most common answers to the most common questions posted last night. i'll also probably try and do another ama when i get my second dose of sinovac, or if i manage to get a spare dose of astrazeneca. so what are the most common issues asked? &#x200b; 1. the 50% efficacy rate of sinovac comes from the lowest studied efficacy for preventing mild to moderate symptoms coming from brazil. it does not mean that you have a 50/50 chance of generating an immune response. it means that based on that study, you have a 50/50 chance of either having mild/moderate symptoms if infected, or having no symptoms at all. you will still have an immune response, but you may either show symptoms of fighting back the virus, or looking normal. 2. otoh, you have an 83% chance to not need treatment, and nearly 100% chance of not being icu. this severe form of infection is what will debilitate you and possibly kill you, if you could even afford an icu stay in the first place. so not only will it protect you from medical bankruptcy, it will also save your life. sure you'll have symptoms, but symptoms are better than being dead. 3. immunity does not mean that the virus doesn't get in your body. it means that the body can amount an automatic defense against the virus without having to study it first. which means that from the start your body can effectively start fighting it already. this will limit the damage it does to you and limit limit your ability to infect someone else. 4. minimum infective dose. by extension, you will still shed virus particles, but by having a working immune system, the virus cannot replicate enough of itself to be able to produce enough numbers of viruses to infect someone else. so by being vaccinated, not enough virus is made to infect someone else. however, mid can vary depending on the health of the person. a person with uncontrolled aids or taking immunosuppressive meds will have a lower mid than the average person, so you still need to wear a mask to protect other people. 5. sinovac is not advised for people above 60 or below 18 due to lack of relevant studies. for those ages, the other western vaccines are recommended. 6. allergies are not an absolute contraindication against taking vaccines, unless you have a known history of anaphylactic reaction to elements of the vaccine. these are the people who generally cannot be vaccinated, which is why herd immunity is important. 7. pain and swelling are expected normal adverse reactions to vaccines. it means your immune system is doing it's job and not slacking off. in fact you should be worried if you get jabbed and feel nothing. 8. you should never feel/be forced to take a vaccine. you should take a vaccine, but of your own free will, and if circumstances allow be able to choose what you want. vaccines work, even sinovac. these are the answers to the most common questions presented.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/lwqiva/summary_tldr_of_answers_to_the_most_asked/,3 03 2021
I think I had CoVid and survived,"cause: week before i got sick i shared meals relatives who returned home from japan and singapore that could've been possible asyptomatic carriers. first day: i got sore throat but i had a late night milktea kasi so akala ko yun lang yung cause blurry kasi sick~ but i experienced body pain prolly after nung first meal with said relatives then simula nung sore throat, had fever then asthma na super lala for 5 days then i went in for check up na. i got myself checked then i was confined for a week. first time even after getting pneumonia twice before to be plugged with oxygen. i obviously got better enough to be released and then had a follow up check up and had meds prescribed. as of now i'm okay already but since i was not tested for covid19 and i experienced all the symptoms even vomitting i wonder if i had it and survived. p.s. simula pagkalabas ko i had all my family wearing masks na all the time + keep them stocked with alcohol in fear na they might bring it home to me,its been more than 14 days and no one showed signs naman with everyone who had close contact with me. throwaway because of the stigma and because i just want everyone to question the number of cases we have. if i might have really gone through it how many cases do you think go unreported? how many deaths are not counted and chalked up to pneumonia and asthma? edit: i received some hateful dms saying i lied at put people at risk...especially after a doctor died because someone lied..i didn't do it intentionally. i was upfront with my what happened to me during my check up and that i had relatives from japan and singapore. i was honest on the paper sheet the hospital makes everyone fill up which mostly just asked if i travelled to china or have close contact to wild animals. my doctor may have not been briefed to have cases like mine to be submitted for testing and i wasn't tested. while i feel bad for what i may have unintentionally done......blaming me for the shortcomings of doh and this government just made me feel glad i made a throwaway account. i have now called my barangay officials and explained my case they just suggested i self quarantine unless i have symptoms again. from now on i'll start eating my meals in my room and stay here for 14 days.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/fm11s9/i_think_i_had_covid_and_survived/,20 03 2020
"Japan Intern experience, tayo nasa lupa pa sila nasa langit na","sorry sa wrong capitalization and english, binilisan ko lang based from exp. as i worked for a factory/manufacturing company as a technical intern trainee. i learned something to be wary about in japan. before i'm deployed as a technical intern trainee, my local agency gave me a hint about not to say inappropriate words even in my thoughts, while in japan, which is to me, a very weird info to remember about. i never think about it that much, up until the following events. everything went smoothly from our schooling for 6months but covid happened so we are forced to wait for 1 and a half year, schooled again for a month up until we departed to japan. we went on a training center in nagoya. there i met fellow trainees which are from different countries as well as trainees same nationality but not from the same agency. it was enjoyable since its our first time to interact with these nationalities and they seem unique in their own way, as well as a new sight to see as someone who doesnt go out often. it was a bit easy since japanese language isnt that troubling for me. it was a trainwreck sometimes since theres a lot of ruckus between races since conflict between cultures are naturally meant to happen. i dont know why but im wary about the japanese, is it because of their image in social media, or is it that im careful on the unknown. knowing all the atrocities they've done in wars, etc., other than that, all i know about them are their contributions through anime, food, etc. after departing from the training center, we moved our baggage in a van, one of our company's representatives said something thats inappropriate, saying ""you can pull down that seat, or you could just sit in the floor like in the philippines."". that was a bit distracting to me. but i just throw it off as some joke thats out of context. when we reached the company dorm , they bought us basic necessities for our daily living there, which we appreciate. on our first day of the job, we are oriented by the line leaders in the factory. went well, and then we are asked to watch and learn for our job. my first job was on a machine called rip cutter, basically, it cut the ends of the rubber. i put the rubber in there, let the machine do its thing, and then they are passed unto the next process which is called breaker. i was thought by the vietnamese, which are good lads btw. up until 2 weeks, i was asked to do it alone, it went badly since i cant achieve the quota yet. there are duties i couldnt attend like cleaning sometimes since time is up for the next shift. i got another week of coaching again, this time a filipino. for me, he thought me better, since there is no language barrier, i can ask him anything i want. i stabilize from thereon onwards. after a whole month, i am transferred to the building next to mine. where i was thought another process, this time all hands on, no machine involved. im cutting the tips of a ropelike rubber evenly. thought by a vietnamese again, took me a week this time. after few weeks of cutting, the palm of my hand start hurting from using a large scissor. i asked my supervising agency in japan to skip work for a day due to this. they asked me to visit a clinic for this inconvenience, which i agreed. got a permission, and they gave me cooling strips for my palm. the next day, it still hurt to the point that i still cant touch anything without a sharp pain in my palm. so i asked the supervising agency again for another dayoff early morning. this time i got reprimanded, maybe due to the short notice. this time i promised i will go to work even with medical emergencies as long as it's tolerable. after getting accustomed to the job, i bought a personal computer for myself. i tohught this would accompany me for the remaining 2years or so. rode a bicycle around aichi prefecture, go to sega and play crane games, asked my upperclassmen to teach us the train system, and go to nearby malls, etc. the following months went smoothly up until one of my friends start to feel unwell on his workplace. his silly attitude changed into a gloomy one. we asked him how was he but he just say hes fine. everyone in our dorm feel that something is wrong. i thought it was a personal problem at first, but i can feel him forcing himself to work so it should be work related. me on the other hand, i just go to work, do what needs to be done, and then go home to relax, because the work is very exhausting for me. the time came when my vietnamese upperclassmen at work are about to go back to their own country since their 5year contract are done. it was that time when they thought me not just the menial work but also the complexities of my work. like proper timing, where to get work related things necessary for the job, and to help on the cleaning of the entire area in my workplace, not just my workstation. they are good upperclassmen, very respectable. but things got suspicious on my last conversation on them before they leave. they said that there would be an exam within the company, that 'i should follow the words i would be hearing around me or from the populace, if i dont understand just get the japanese dictionary and understand the word, and there would be a timelimit on this, the longer i took this exam the more i trouble the people around me, and also, i cant go anywhere outside my city yet, i should follow the process before i could slowly go to the next city or so'. its just too vague for me that time. they also said that 'this will help me understand the world', where i just laughed. i nver took the advice seriously, since i plan to not stay long in japan. all i think about is to enjoy the momment in there, so i went my filipino uppercclassmen to go to osu kannon, nagoya, not heeding the advice of my vietnamese upperclassmen. as i go to these places, everything went well, it was fun going out with the homies. there was an upcoming exam on our 6th month as a trainee, where we are given reviewers and educational videos for our jobs. i studied on the last week before the exam, since it was a bit easy. the exam happened and it went well. the problem is the other exam foreshadowed by my vietnamese upperclassmen who finished their contract. it started at the end of october, where i was given new tasks at work, thought by a coworker, and then i remember that this task was exactly what the vietnamese upperclassman thought me from before but he didnt explain it that clearly that time, because he's in the middle of his job and we just had a small talk. and then, when i went to duty the next day at work, i started hearing looped japanese words around me. i suspect its from the speakers around the workplace. what confirmed my doubt was when they said its an exam and told me what needed to be done. i dont mind it that time, since im used to the job already. they said that you should concentrate during work, dont ask for help or wait for help, time my movements, etc., but the problem on this is that they insult us when me make mistakes. which is fine, since everything went smoothly up until that point, the work should be a challenge since its japan were talking about, they are detail oriented. but what's bugging me is after my work at 5pm, the japanese residents i passed by started saying vague things and say it out of the blue, i dont even speak to the residents that much, yet this time they're the one who spoke to me first, like how im an idiot or unsophisticated. that is when i confirmed its the really the ""test"" the vietnamese upperclassman told me about. i did this so called ""test"", i get what theyre trying to do here, for self improvement and discipline to its trainees. but it went south quickly when the company started asking unreasonable things and do punishments unthinkable to our society today. they hated me for making friends, giving things to people i value, and most of all, they asked me to not joke around or stop being cheerful. like how can i suddenly just stop being me, ma homie?. these values are already instilled into me, and they hate me for that. i receive these instructions when i work in the company or from the residents. what's more mind boggling is how they discipline us if we dont follow or ignore them, there are some kind of device moving inside my body that inflicts pain, cause headaches, coldness in the hands and feet, ifever i ignore or disobey their instructions. the catch here is that these so called discipline from the company also happens to me in my apartment, what more, it disciplines me even in my thoughts, like saying vulgar words. i conclude then, that means there's 24/7 supervision on us while were staying in japan. i noticed it when i experienced their ""way of discipline"" when im playing computergames, joke around with my friends, say something rude, thinking about something obscene, etc. thats the end of the rope for me, i contacted polo tokyo and osaka for this, i received a lot of backlash, from the residents, from the company, got insulted everyday at work, residents started being rude to me. i consider this as a threat, that means they are in control, if they can inflict discomfort from inside of our bodies who knows what else they could do. i broke no rules outside my dorm, but to have this much constraints is just too much. &#x200b; conclusion: japan is a work only zone. you can't say no. you in, you in.

"Both Of My Knees Experiences Discomfort, Mga Kapwa Pinoy Please Help Me","i am 18 (m) 5'9"" and 60 kilos, who had been having knee discomforts for the past 3 weeks. the knee causes slight pain when cold winds brush past it after leg exercises. as for the daily discomfort, it gets noticably uncomfortable when i fully extend my knees and put all of my body weight on them. the history of my knees goes way back to 8th grade when i first started to hear pops every time i squat too deeply on the ground to sit. throughout 7th and 8th grade, i was not mindful of what i ate or do. but on my 9th grade, i started to do body weight training which got me somewhat fit. soon, however, i stopped in 10th grade. then, when i got into 11th and 12th grade (now), i was living a sedentary life-style that consisted of barely decent eating habits and stressing over text books and academic grades. 3 months ago, my dad bought a gym-equipment and so i started exercising. this led me to (on and off) lift weights an hour for 4 days a week. first, i started slow and light, but then i had seem to over-etimate my strength and soon lifted weights that was beyond my ability. a month in, i started doing deadlifts and squats that weighs 60 pounds (one day a week). my workout routine's plan was just to do reps until i feel like i can't do 2 more reps. with all being said, i suspect that the main cause is weight-lifting. also, i am in modular learning during this pandemic. which means that, for me, i have to get my modules in places that requires me to travel far away. every friday, i would drive my motorcycle for an hour just to get my modules, and during such, my knee would be open towards the harsh sunlight. it must be known that for the past few years, i was s person that loved shades because sunlight hurts my skin. which is why over time, i suspect that it also had somewhat damaged my knees to an extent, which had also led me to suffer faster damage on my knees. i live in the philippines and i come from a low-middle class filipino family. these past few days, i had always been confused and don't know what to do. my dad is jobless and my mom is a domestic helper abroad. we are hardly getting money during these times, and it saddens me to think that they will spend for my injuries. but if it needs to be done, then i would get it over with and would not let it worsen. please help me. please tell me the steps that i need to take to get bettee and the possible costs of my treatment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/kjbjie/both_of_my_knees_experiences_discomfort_mga_kapwa/,24 12 2020

Pinoy Pop or Ppop?,"the reason i created an account here in reddit was to join the discussion about ppop music: have you tried listening to one? which is recently posted here in r/philippines. some of the earliest comments (can't find it na) mentioned that they'd rather call it pinoy pop rather than ppop because it sounds like kpop, jpop and *insert country*-pop. did the label ""ppop"" became a contributing factor to the prejudice why some filipinos are labeling the genre 'gaya-gaya', 'baduy', at hindi pinoy? if the term pinoy pop is the one that was popularized would you be more accepting and open to explore? napaisip ako. admittedly, pop has long been existing and doing good naman in the opm scene, usually solo artists. however, they didn't try to popularize a sublabel under opm. the term ppop was used even before sb19, in fact may show/award giving body na that uses the term. but it was not really that known to the general public unlike now that it's slowly growing and used by other debuting artists to introduce and classify themselves. to give background on how and why ppop is used today, based on what i know only, here's the story: one of the most painful and heartbreaking part of sb19's journey na sobrang affected ang a'tin is their go up presscon which happened days before they became viral. there, they were roasted and criticized by philippine media. most questions asked were borderline offensive and disrespectful. in that interview, they were compared to kpop too especially since the company that took the risk to train filipino talents (even if they are not molded into the 'half-blooded', mestizo beauty standard of tv networks and filipino viewers 🙃) is a korean company, thus the rigorous training system that filipino performers on tv (esp. groups) lack. the group were interrogated - ""how are you different from kpop if you're basically just singing it in filipino?"" (the producer of their earliest songs are koreans since that's where the company have connections with. now, korean staffs are never or rarely involved na.) pablo answered that they write their own songs - based on their experiences as filipinos, it is their story, their soul that they bare through their music and what shaped those experiences and story is our very own filipino culture. it is evident even before, with go up literally using 'garuda' in its lyrics. now, with mapa - a tribute song for our parents, mana - shortened from manananggal 🦇 and even witty references of regular filipino moments in slmt - parang 'di nagbayad 1 2 3 hanggang peace lang 🎵🎶 which is a jeepney fare reference 🤣. they further added that just like any other country, we have pop music too - pinoy pop. ppop. that became the trigger why the fans are so passionate in introducing the boys as pinoys. since then, early a'tin has been fighting for the group to be recognized as filipinos. sb19 themselves, classify and introduced their group as ppop. we were correcting and informing news outlets, casual viewers, big personalities and media companies that they are a ppop group and not just a cover group. left and right, on different social media platforms, countless news, and even in live shows where the group is performing. the iconic fan shouting to the mic, ""ppop po sila, hindi kpop!"" in up fair is a legend in a'tin community ✨️ and everything paid off 😊. slowly, by the fans constant request, news outlets changed their narrative. anyone new is being informed. artists, mostly groups, started to introduce themselves as a ppop group too. talent and management agencies began to conduct auditions and announced the formation of several existing ppop groups today. the term ppop transitioned from being frowned upon to being accepted gradually. the community is currently growing and developing at high-speed. however the judgement by some still remained. i would like to ask, which would you prefer pinoy pop or ppop? i know, this basically means the same but perhaps the commenter did have a point. will the term pinoy pop be more accepted than ppop?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ymwkoc/pinoy_pop_or_ppop/,5 11 2022
Being an introvert/outcast is actually ok in the PH,"experienced being bullied through entire life, toxic peeps and annoying collectivist society, i'm not afraid to beg to differ. i can still follow rules but sometimes, i only do selective respect to people who deserves to be respected. my outcast phase helped me unlock my new potential aside from dancing,baking and art aesthetics ; seeing everyone and our societal bullshit. society for me is a really scary place yet at the same time, earned so much redeemable people in a hopeless place. i actually earned closed tied peeps and thanks to them, i feel loved. and the social media is like a human condition : imperfection. i realize my entire life was more on what title should be accomplished instead of what should you celebrate in life. being an outcast young adult i learned so much about : 1. filipino family display medals,trophies and grad portrait for validity. i only hanged my grad pics. i never hanged any medals or certificates because i'm not that special and no need for me to validate my existence. i don't want to be a show-off. 2. religion is always big in ph yet every religion, i can smell dirty schemes and hypocrisy. ph is secular but peeps here emphasizes religion more, even in politics and debates, and religion sometimes, is anti-science and progress. 3. politics here is a grand circus : allowing fading celebrities to run for senate seats, even in top positions. plus, enabled some convicted politicians to run again and create a dogshow. ofc, fanaticism is so big, political fanwars are making my head ache. 4. fanaticism should be in moderation, and realize to stop worshipping celebrities and politicians, they're human too, not a deity. ofc, the misbehavior i found on dds/bbm/kakampinks/iskonatics were too appalling. 5. some boomers or ultra-conservative/pseudo-nationalists with gaslighting effect, cognitive dissonance, trying to fool gullible souls. 6. it's okay to be nude as long as you let go of malice and bad inhibitions. since we are in the ""conservative"" (duh, not really) excuse of a society, i would join nudist groups, alone or be nude with someone, to love my body more and appreciate nature and raw senses. as long as you're in a secluded place without peeping toms. 7. filipino gender norms are outdated. i learned to break the chains and encourage everyone to express ourselves. 8. the love of nature. getting bored on those malls and why try hopping on a nature trip (whether clothed or bare it all) 9. filipinos loves stereotypes/titles/labels/ranks so hard they want to brag about it every single day. i rank myself as an ordinary guy. 10. discipline and other values starts at home. should start with yourself, parents and sibs. teach them through toys, materials, situations, occasions, self-expressions and welcoming them on how they feel or to speak out. 11. activism, criticisms and self-expressions were part of democracy and shouldn't be stiffled. embrace humanism, it was part of panatang makabayan and should be practiced. 12. there are more beautiful things in life than spending hours on social media. social media can be toxic, why not put it down and rest while u can. 13. work smart and healthy. also be creative and seek relaxation to gain back. 14. fake news/trolls/revisionism/pseudo-historians/pseudo-intellectuals are a waste of time and brain damage. i would rather seek truth. also stop justifying violence and hate. 15. stop engaging trolls. dirty scheme. 16. create your own happiness by doing what u love or try new things 17. society tells me to conform. nope. myself, my rules. 18. forgiveness is hard, depends on the impact. 19. everything is valid. also, for men, try to open up. you can't gain back if you still hide your internal pain for eternity. everyone deserves healing. 20. celebrate yourself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/tjdp6t/being_an_introvertoutcast_is_actually_ok_in_the_ph/,21 03 2022
I wish I can greet him Happy Father's Day,"tatay was a man of few words. he rarely show emotion, even to us family. but i love how he shows and make us feel loved by working tirelessly to provide for our daily needs, crafting diy projects from custom shelves, tv stands, cabinets, etc. every saturday night he'll ask us to buy some snacks while he prepare our dvd player to watch a movie. he just wanted a simple life, he worked his ass off for us to finish college, and never asked something in return, he only wants us to have be content and happy with our lives. his love is always for us, albeit in silence. years after i had my first job, and starting to pay off our debts, i'm starting buy gifts for him at random occasions, buying groceries for the family, slowly trying to let him be at ease. but everything changed last year. december 2019, he's been mentioning his frequent headaches, thinking it could just be caused by his failing eyesight. he wants to get checked but only got one by january 2020, that's when we were referred to a neuro and then have an mri scan. he even refused at that point since he knew mri scan is not cheap, but later agreed upon knowing it is covered by the health card i got for him and nanay. few days after getting an mri scan, we returned to the neuro. that was the time the doctor told us the what they found in the scan, a 4.5cm x 4cm x 4cm tumor on the right side of his brain - part of brain responsible for organizing thoughts, speech some motor functions. hearing the news, i can help but step a little back and hold my tears while the doctor explains everything, all the while i remember those occassions in the past few months when he's stutterring noticeably, his left eyesight getting poorer, his left limbs getting spasms, and a lot more. later on, the doctor mentioned it needs to be removed and have a biopsy. knowing tatay, i know he'll refuse. and he did, citing that surgery could cost us more than half a million. he only asked to have a second opinion, but the doctor told us the same thing. he's adamant of what the 2 neurologist have told us. he said it could just be something else, perhaps a simple headache. and then the pandemic came and lock downs happened. in few weeks time, we noticed an abrupt change in tatay's condition, stutters became more notiecable, he's losing balance, and he's losing weight. then asked around how to score an appointment to a doctor during lockdown, that's when we got referred to a neurosurgeon. upon sending mri scan we had 3 months prior, he immediately called us and explained everything, convinced tatay to take the surgery. but we were in the middle of pandemic that time, pgh can't take our case other regional hospitals too. we had no choice but to have a surgery in a private hospital, the third doctor that we had referred us to another neurosurgeon that specializes on brain tumors. it was late may, when tatay had his crainiotomy. tatay had a successful surgery, and from a 5cm tumor they were able to remove 5.5cmx7.9cmx6cm tumor, a biopsy was then ordered. tatay also had a great recovery, since he was awake during the whole surgery, the doctor told us that if all goes well he can be discharged in a week. in a week, i have to go to each and every doctor to ask for discount to their pf, had to pull some strings in the hospital and pull out loans without the knowledge of tatay, and also through the help of family and friends tatay got discharged. that same day he got discharged, i vividly remember i went out to get groceries and a cake for tatay, doctor called and told that biopsy results came. tumor was a malignant one, and told me to get back to him as soon as i can. i was lining up at the counter that time, my knees getting weak and can't even hold my tears back while in front of the cashier. going home, i don't even know how am i going to tell them. i have to keep it for a day and let my family enjoy tatay's return from a successful surgery. a day later, and doctor's secretary called reminding us of our appointment after two weeks. that reminded me that i need tell them the results of the biopsy, and i told them that same day. two weeks later, doctor explained everything in full details. the tumor that were removed was indeed a cancerous one, and not just cancerous, a rare type and an aggressive one. again, it's me, nanay and tatay in the clinic, everyone's silent. and tatay asked about survival rate and how long he's going to live. it. again silence. and doctor told him that he only has about a year to live, if lucky, a few more months up to two years. after that, he referred us to another doctor. now, a neuro-oncologist. it was a silent trip going home. we don't even know what to say. doctor reminded me to set an appointment right away since tatay might need to start therapies sooner. from tatay's next doctor, she told us everything we need to know, what to expect and the finances needed, and again tatay asked the same thing survival rate and life expectancy, and she answered the same thing. from this point onward, we have to expect the worst. it was painful for me to keep reminding myself that tatay cpuld be gone in less than a year. tatay soon started his chemo and radiotherapy sessions. months later something hit tatay, he became covid positive. but his body took it well, he's asymptomatic. but still he pushed to be in quarantine that time, and only nanay can take care of him. after twsting negative, he then resumed his theraphy and finally finishing all his sessions. from here onwards, it was us now taking care of tatay, making sure he takes his medicine, eating well, and recording if we notice anything wrong. aside from the bi-monthly checkups and getting sets of chemotherapy tablets, tatay mostly stayed at home. it was a roller-coaster ride, we had fo endure his mood swings, depressive states and his the emotional stress he's going through. it was painful for us to see him that way. tatay who i mostly see as a strong-willed person crying he's going to die soon. tatay's emotion became erratic, sometimes you can just hear him play some games or watch videos in his phone, somethime you'll hear him crying, or shouting. it was early this year that his health started gradually decline again. doctor ordered an mri again, aside from his monthly ones, then we found another mas in his brain it's was at 7cm that time and knew it's growing so fast since they didn't see 2 or 3 weeks prior. we were given an option to operate on it again or ultimately wait for the inevitable. going home, we had to ask tatay and he refused the operation, saying it's useless if upon removing it will come back. we chose the latter. after that, tatay's condition started fo rapidly decline. him standing from bed became a difficult task for him, to the point in last march that he became bed ridden. his eyesight getting poorer. his stutter became random words, and from random words to unintelligible murmurs, to nothing. he cannot speak anymore and the only way we devised to communicate is by asking yes/no questions tatay only needs to squeeze our hands. this was the time it hit me. we're slowly losing tatay. i would come to his room, and hold his hands. he's just squeezing my hands in some sort of intervals but i can't figure out what he's trying to say. i can only whisper some comforting words in his ears, thanking him for everything he's done for us, and if he's thinking of the debts he doesn't have to, i reassure him that i will take care of nanay and my siblings, there won't be a time that we'll be hungry. i have to hold back my tears everytime i came to his room and tell those things while holding his hands. i have to show i'm strong enough. but at night i can't help but cry to sleep thinking how can i handle everything, and only my girlfriend knows that i sometimes cry to sleep and that i'm starting to get depressed overthinking. i can't even show my weakness to my family. while the 1 year that doctor told us is coming, i can't help but accept that tatay is slowly dying, a slow and hopefully not a painful one. last month, with us in the room, and with tatay's siblings who coincidentally decided to visit him that day, we lost him. memory is still vivid, of the time we noticed his hands losing it warmth, his deep breathing and coughing, and i have to call his doctor and at the same time an ambulance. but that time, i had an idea that we're losing him, from the end-of-life care pointers that his doctor have told me, those last few hours, i only asked the doctor through call if this is it, she only told us the bring him to the hospital. but on transit, we lost him. the wailing siren got drown out of the cries of nanay and my tita. outside of the er, he was pronounced dead. tatay left us. tatay is now at peace, no sickness, no pain. today, father's day, and also the 40th day of his death. i wish i can greet him and hug him, but that can't. and i hope i know what he's trying to tell me that time i'm holding his hand but he can't utter any word. to tatay, who gave everything for us, who's love will always be for us. i will always dedicate this day for you and celebrate the life we had when we're together. and if you're still reading, this is the sign, call your dad. if you still had the chance to do so, cook something for him, ask him to teach you how fix a car, how to fix plumbing, anything that that you'll enjoy doing together, and lastly thank him for all the things he has done.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/o3o53g/i_wish_i_can_greet_him_happy_fathers_day/,19 06 2021
I was scammed to pay for our company's event and now I'm in debt and they're harassing me. I need help.,"i work in a company here in ph and it's been over 2 years since i joined this company and along the way there were red flags, but it wasn't until this event transpired until i realized i should have transferred earlier. of course to protect myself i'm using a throwaway account and of course will change names and other details that might identify me. anyway, for context here's my history with the company. **note:** if you wanna skip to the main story just scroll down to the paragraph marked bold with ""main part of the story"". i apologize for the very long post. i joined the company during the pandemic. of course it was a desperate time and any job is a blessing especially when i was accepted even though i wasn't a college graduate. i wouldn't say i was the best employee, but in a span of 6 months, by the time i was regularized, i basically became a member of the management committee. heading 2 departments: pr and admin. mind you i became the department head. with my roles, of course i did all i could to improve the company. creating systems, building relationships, and fixing existing stuff because to be honest it was problematic. the employees don't have benefits, the handbook was so problematic and lacking, and we barely have presence. i cannot entirely claim hat i fixed it all because i did have help but i did initiate, oversee, and complete many things for the improvement of the company. and as i work through all this, i slowly observe a lot of red flags. first, are the misogynistic tendencies of our ceo. there is only one female and one lgbt (me) member in the managing company, and only the two of us who really do the work. the rest are straight men who tbh, are only the senior (in terms of length of stay) though have a lot of lapses in their roles as managers, though they are good at their jobs. even though there are more qualified members who could replace those straight men, for some reason it never happened. another red flag is the transphobia displayed by our ceo. it was during a company party, and everyone is in a drunken conversation. one of the topics that came up was about having one night stand drunk and waking up realizing the other person wasn't ho they thought. a co-worker joked that he'd be scared if the other person was a trans woman, which our ceo remarked, he never understood it why would people consider them as woman, because in his opinion they are men, and could never be a woman. we almost got into an argument but i digress. our ceo is a toxic masculine, making remarks like he would fuck a guy to show dominance as an ""alpha male"". he would even make offensive and uncomfortable remarks even in front of our female co-workers. he thinks he is a mental health expert. he tries to attend talks and coach people in the context that he is a mental health expert which is very offensive. he doesn't have the degree nor the research to be an expert. he doesn't even have any idea of words that could be triggering for a lot of people. and the worst in this case, a lead expressed that a member of his/her is feeling depressed and down, and our ceo replied that he could take over the coaching session and bring them back. from where? idk. but he is so unqualified to even approach the subject. and after all these red flags, i digressed and push on to do my best to improve the company. and not to brag but there are a lot of moments where you could see our ceo getting mind fucked by how productive and innovative my proposals and my and my team's output could be. ***main part of the story:*** now comes the worst part of all. as pr, of course it is my job to create campaigns that could build relationships with our community, and ultimately become a household name. the best opportunity came, and it was our company's anniversary (one of the milestone numbers). and i did all the things right. i created a proposal, with projected expenses, pros and cons, ""possible"" fund sources etc. long story short it was approved in the guise that the organizing team have the autonomy in the project. as we make preparations for the event, a major problem came. we couldn't find partners that could help us with the event. the only partners e have are those who make certain aspects of the event free of charge or with an over the top discount which we are more than happy. the only thing we need from our ceo is are the initial working budget which he complied and his guestlist, which he did not properly compile, even with help (another red flag). the event was nearing yet we are still in the red. an we get to have one meeting with our ceo asking for help for funds (which means he knows we will be relying on the company's funds, this will be important later). he gave us a list of names to ask for solicitations. yet albeit the best efforts of my team, they didn't turn out. however, we pushed through because we knew how important the results will be. came the event, and as the organizer, i did all my power to make sure it was successfully pushed through, which i did. i even won awards my self for my job/performance for the past few years. and even though it was a roller coaster, it was successful. majority of the goals we set are achieved. however, during one of the event's post mortem meeting, i was dumbfounded of the accusations my ceo make about the event. calling it shady, saying it was too much, and that nobody enjoyed. and those who resigned are my fault. a lot of things were said and transpired, and i didn't expect that he has no plan in refunding. saying the expenses are unauthorized, and that he should have signed the contracts (even though i was approved autonomy) and that i was being shady even though everything was accounted for. here is what actually happened. 1. the event cannot be shady when everything was documented properly. 2. he said people were complaining the employees weren't consulted of the activities when in fact, i personally presented to the whole company the event after it was approved. 3. the event was ""too much"" when in fact as i talk with some of my coworkers they are happy to have moments where they could dress up and enjoy. 4. nobody enjoyed, when even he himself was so happy giving praises to me and the team even privately. 5. the 2 people who left are my fault, when in fact i only had a confrontation with one of them and it was me, being firm of the rules and pointing system which that person was trying to bend. i asked for my team and other coworkers if how i handled it and they said i was nothing but calm and not aggressive. plus, because of the event, the influx of people wanting to apply to our company increased by 200% because they heard about our activities. 6. we shouldn't have pushed the event if there wasn't any funds available even though 1 he had an idea how much we need and 2 he approved the project budget. we are even under budget. 7. expenses were unauthorized when in fact he approved the projected expense. 8. the event wasn't for the company but for my need for attention, when in fact it was the company's anniversary, and i was mostly in the background making sure the event is going smoothly while he brags the event was the labor or his hard work. he's been bragging about his lifestyle, how much the company earns, and taking all the glory yet he doesn't have the balls to pay for the event of his company which he approved. i am a working student. i am honestly severely underpaid for the job ""titles"" i have. and yet he made me pay for his event. i could barely support my mom and myself and now i am php 400k in debt (including interest) which i need to pay for the next 4 years. i felt betrayed by the company i helped improved which tbh would've imploded. i was honestly depressed and traumatized, and to be honest i was even thinking about suicide. it was so hard to even write this post but i feel so alone and i really need to vent. even in this state, i was still confronted by the ceo 2 weeks ago to tell me i wasn't the victim. and it was my fault why i am in this position. that i need to make amends with my coworkers for making such a disaster, and that he was also in debt once so i need to ""man up"" cause it's just money. i can't afford to pay off 400k for 4 years, and it's a big chunk off my already small pay. i basically paid for his event. i should be treated as a sponsor, yet he treats me like shit. instead of harassing me, for such a bad job why wouldn't he fire me? (which i realize is also another red flag). also, if he thinks i'm shady, and that i did such a bad job, why would he ask me to organize another company event? i feel so trapped in this company which i can't afford to lose so i won't get sued for not paying my debt. gosh for that amount i could have started my own business, but instead i paid for someone else's event. i am so scared and depressed and stressed and idk what else i feel but i cannot live like this. actually i'm looking for a job that i could transfer to because i feel deeply uncomfortable with the company i am in. my mom suggested that we ask help from ""tulfo"" but i know making it public would be a career suicide. i really need help. and it feels like i am still far from hitting rock bottom and i am scared. i'm really sorry for the long post. i hope i could get insights from you guys. thank you. edit 1: so, i had a consultation with the public attorney's office, and sad to say i do not have much of a case. the only documentation i have is the approval of the event. however, even though it was logical and obvious it was a company event, i need someone to corroborate or a document that could prove the company should've shouldered the expenses and not me. the first one is hard to come by, and the second one seems impossible since our closed doors meeting doesn't have a minutes. i guess my only chance to get my money back and pay the dept is to win the lottery, hahaha. but kidding aside, i'm scouring every document i have to check if he had any slip ups and hopefully find the proof i need. edit 2: so, i got fired. not because he knows i'm trying to build a case around him, but because he gave me an assignment a month ago to have a conversation with my workmates and ask for forgiveness or closure. to be honest, i have no idea why. after all i've been through, he piles another thing on me that i don't think even is true. so i tried asking a few of the senior members who i know will definitely spill some tea, but all i get from the conversation was, ""i was an intense umpire but they really enjoyed the event and were happy that they get to have that for the company."" so, what the hell was going on. we had another meeting where he obviously looks unhappy because my conversation so far with my workmates isn't going where he think it is, so he up the ante. he told me i should meet them in person instead. mind you these guys are working night shifts while i do days, and some are working remotely from the city. it's like he's deliberately making my life harder. i tried to do it, but i fell ill for the past few weeks, which he was informed of. we had a meeting last friday and there, because i wasn't able to talk to my coworkers i was fired. i was sick, do i have to risk myself and others just to do his clearly stupid task? do i have to force myself amidst my high fever and aching body? we're still not in the clear of the pandemic, so i cant compromise my coworkers and myself. plus the schedule conflict, it's impossible to physically meet people. it's like he changed the requirement just so i could fail. so, here i am, scouring for a better job that could pay my debt and bills. but the worst part is, he's trying to weasel out of my severance. saying i have payables to the company. what payables? i'm the one in debt. if only i could sue for pain and suffering. sorry for the long update.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/wwokdy/i_was_scammed_to_pay_for_our_companys_event_and/,24 08 2022

the serious, cautious, cunning and quiet, yet kind, creative, perserverant, loving, caring and loyal main protagonist of the series and the human boyfriend (and eventually husband) of valerie, a female aswang who is also his childhood friend and crush. as a mixed-martial artist from the barangay of patrocinio, claveria, misamis oriental, he is a fearless and determined warrior of unlikely austronesian and european descent, and is experienced in asymmetrical warfare, mixed-martial arts and sharpshooting skills. he is a **""monster hunter""** or a **""battle-hardened human""**, a naturally enchanced human being caused by a rare evolutionary defense mechanism of the *'homo sapiens'* of his universe in response to hard work and years of combat experience fighting monsters, which causes their bodies to dramatically change and revert back to a more primal stage, growing bigger, stronger, faster, smarter, tougher, healthier, more aggressive, and possess a better animal flight zone than ordinary human beings in order to match the ferocity of dangerous monsters and slay them, literally embodying the quote of *“whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster”* by **friedrich nietzsche** as a result. due to his adhd type 1, combined with ptsd from his tragic childhood involving monsters, and his strange decision to live alone in his deceased parent's cottage in the mountains at the age of fifteen to become strong and independent, he became an outcast of filipino society for being different, only his childhood friend, valerie s. arévalo, and the local elderly people like his deceased wwii/korean war veteran grandfather trusted him and believe him to be a good boy, while he is feared and shunned by young people around his age for being different and violent, especially when he is rumoured by them as a brutal monster slayer who uses inhumane hunting methods and deadly ammunition types to cause fear and suffering to the more common monsters like sigbin and aswang, and also the fact that he doesn't care about fitting in filipino society as he is aware of their flaws and lies due to his access to the internet where he does actual research and they hate him for telling the truth, but he didn't care what society thinks because he was determined to do what he wants without the need for validation. he used to distrust monsters, and even brutally killed and tortured the same aswang group who had devoured his parents years prior, despite his grandfather warning to only use everything he had thought him for defense before his death, but eventually learned from valerie that they too are tragic beings that require their help. so after graduating highschool and college together with her after the mindanao chapter, he accompanies valerie in her travel across the four islands philippines to solve the ancient mystery behind their origins. although juan possesses size, strength, intelligence, creativity, versatility, independence, and his fierce determination and cunning nature as a man and a warrior, his adhd makes him forgetful about things he's not really interested in and gets easily distracted most of the time, and he is revealed to be an awkward and anxious person who isn't used to how society works as he had spent much of his childhood and adolescent years training in isolation with his veteran grandfather's teachings, so he could only use his primal instincts more often than being a civilised person, such as deeming other men his age as ""rival bachelors"" and intimidating those who tries to flirt on valerie, or observing every area he walks by to analyze any possible threat to his and valerie's lives. physically, he lacks valerie's speed and agility in combat, and mentally, he doesn't compare to her maturity, wisdom, knowledge, concentration, and leadership skills allowed her to live as a normal person, but she helps him to learn new things about the humanity and the world around them during their journey so he would eventually become a better person, and allow him to take the lead in certain situations. in combat, he serves as a long-ranged support for valerie, with the use of his foreign mixed martial arts, stealth, salvaged modern firearms and holy anti-magic sword and spear. | **valerie e. arévalo** | - the quirky and cheerful, yet selfless, stoic and fiercely loyal deurotagonist and the mascot of the series, she is the titular monster partner (and later wife) of juan, as she is an **'aswang'**, one of the many demon types, humans corrupted by the dark magic of an unknown ancient evil. she is a member of a rich family from balamban, cebu in central visayas. she had moved alongside her guardians to the barangay of poblacion in claveria, misamis oriental in mindanao for true reasons yet to be revealed, although she simply claims that she is the only aswang in her family and was sent by her parents to a more rural location to allow her to grow up safely, undetected by the eyes of **""the armed forces of the philippines""** who would deem her as a threat to human society and from the violent **""monster hunters""** who would hunt and kill monsters like her for sport, glory, or easy money. she is juan's childhood friend, whom she met while he and his cousins were fishing on a river just a year after the death of his parents, and grew up together. but when he eventually finds out that she is an aswang, he attempted to kill her due to his ptsd and his instinct to slay monsters, but she easily defeats him due to her being stronger and more experienced in combat compared to the creatures that juan had slain before the start of the series. after settling ther issues and giving juan a (painful) reality check, they rekindle their friendship, and valerie convinces juan to help others by joining her in their voyage across the philippines to find out the mysteries behind the monsters, and to find a way for her to become human to reunite with her family (and potentially marry juan should he accept her). she usually takes the lead and initiative over juan due to her greater wisdom and maturity, alongside her superior athletic prowess and martial art discipline, social & multilingual skills, and wealth. however, she still struggles with her flaws which are opposites to juan, most notably her dependence on her family's fortune compared to juan who can survive and kill most monsters on his own in the rainforest and aquatic environments even with just sticks and stones, her inability to eat anything other than the flesh and life force of living creatures which saddens her every time she looks as juan eats typical filipino cuisines, and her insecurities about her looks without makeup compared to other women and doubting that juan would ever fall in love with her, getting moments of violent tendencies as a result to the point where even the brave juan would get nervous around her, making him regret some of his own actions once valerie snaps, and once secretly referred to her as a ""yandere anime girl"" while discussing with a classmate who was fond of japanese anime during their college years. but as juan slowly develops throughout their journey, he began to understood their similar problems together and regularly helps valerie to better their relationship and teamwork in helping their fellow filipino people throughout their journey. in combat and other emergencies, she serves as the main close-combat attacker and medical support, who assists juan using her archery skills with bows and crossbows, her own bolos, and her aswang abilities, which consists of her razor sharp teeth, claws, and dark energy manipulation for battle. valerie drives an uplifted and heavily modified **2008 toyota land cruiser v8** she nicknamed ""ken"" for her and juan to travel throughout the harsh geography of the philippines and carry medical and utility supplies for aiding others. samples of planned music to be used as soundtrack: -

Ed Lingao's statement on the ABS-CBN Franchise issue (Very long post),"*(op's note: this came straight from mr. lingao's official facebook account. cannot post link here due to subreddit rules, so i might as well place the entire post here. have informed him of the matter...)* ------------------------- i need to warn you folks that this might be kinda long. before i left for iraq in 2003, i was asked repeatedly why, when i didn't have to (i was in current affairs, i wasn't even in news), and besides, why tempt fate (afghanistan was just two years earlier, and we almost failed to make it out of that one). some even asked if it was for the hazard pay (""ang laki siguro ng binayad sa iyo ano?"") no i did not get any hazard pay at all. returning after a month in iraq, i just collected my one month salary as a regular manila-based producer. was it the ""overwhelming"" support that we got during these deployments? hardly. i bought a second hand flak jacket in quiapo using my own money, and borrowed steel helmets from the philippine marines. i borrowed some money from friends and colleagues to add to our suicide budget (thank you david jude sta. ana!) and my wife also pitched in to help. in baghdad, rival gma's howie severino was even kind enough to give me his leftover iraqi money before they returned to manila (i have no idea how howie liquidated that expense) i did not do it for abs-cbn. i did it because it was something that had to be done, and sometimes, you really believe it has to be done by you. that is why it pains me whenever people throw around that ""bayaran"" and ""presstitute"" label so glibly just because they disagree with what you have to say. is the profession perfect? far from it. abs-cbn was a perfect example of our many imperfections. we fought our internal battles more times than i would care to remember, from problems with politics to problems with priorities. and in the end, i really learned to appreciate the people i worked with - the colleagues who stood by us in our many battles, and some of our immediate bosses who covered for us, or simply turned a blind eye, when we simply refused to obey. loyalty to your profession needs to trump other loyalties. sound noble, right? well, sometimes, or perhaps many times, we lose our battles. the point is to know that these are battles that we need to keep fighting. and so it was a love-hate relationship of sorts with that network. there were days you stood proudly, and days when you wanted to walk out. in the end, we upped and left, joining abc-5 in 2004. abs-cbn filed a p21 million damage suit against me and two other correspondents for breach of contract. our contract stated that we were to ""avoid doing anything prejudicial to the interest of abs-cbn"" for a period of one year. needless to say, we refused to have the network dictate how we could practice our profession long after we had left the station. (after several years, the quezon city regional trial court dismissed abs-cbn's suit. refusing to give up, the network elevated it to the court of appeals. sometime in 2011 or 2012, i was finally informed by our lawyer atty. chel diiokno that the ca had also thrown out the network's case. we found it amusing that the network was facing so many cases for dismissing several workers, while it spent eight years chasing after those who had chosen to leave voluntarily.) i thought of putting this all out here for context. there are those who seem to think i am still with abs (helloooo) and at least one guy who keeps insinuating i was paid off by that network to side with it on the franchise issue (hellloooooo). now to the issues. this is the fun part. -clearly, the network's broadcast problem is because of a lack of a congressional franchise. to me, that was never even a point of debate. i don't even know why some people try to debate me on this as if i had ever said otherwise. i have pointed this out in so many explainers in the past. act 3846 of 1931 clearly states that you cannot broadcast without a congressional franchise. that predates any presidential decree or post-87 constitution law or mou. but would a provisional authority (pa) from the ntc have sufficed? i was always suspicious of that proposal by legislators to just have the ntc issue a provisional authority. solb na kaagad? i'm no lawyer, but the jurisprudence was pretty clear as early as 2003, when the sc released gr 144109. that ruling threw out the justice department's 1991 legal opinion that the ntc can issue a pa while congress deliberates on a franchise. that doj opinion, opinion 98 series of 1991, was issued by then justice secretary franklin drilon. incidentally, drilon still maintains the same opinion. lawyers being lawyers, people argued back and forth that this ruling vs a provisional authority did not apply to abs-cbn because the circumstances were different. in 1994, the ntc, kbp, and the franchise committee signed an mou along the same lines. but none of them can trump an sc decision. in other words, 17 years ago, the sc already said that a congressional franchise is needed, and a provisional authority (pa) will simply not suffice. -when the doj, the ntc, and the legislators declared in early march that the franchise crisis had been averted with their provisional authority (pa) compromise, i thought that: a) this is a tenuous and legally unstable/untenable arrangement, b) the provisional or temporary authority can be withdrawn anytime, meaning the network will have to ""behave"" (or be held hostage) in accordance with the wishes of the issuing authority. in other words, good luck, hawak na sila sa bayag. and, c) congress now has an even better excuse not to act on the franchise bill any time soon. until it's too late. like what happened after may 5. other people breathed a sigh of relief with that compromise; but i thought, being the eternal pessimist, that this is going to be even more problematic. -the ball really goes back to congress. the ntc is just a patsy. congress is the one with the responsibility and the power to review and approve a broadcast franchise. congress used that power by simply sitting on the franchise bills in the 16th, 17th, and 18th congresses. it could have been acted on by the 16th congress, but the urgency was apparently not yet there since the expiration was still three congresses and one administration later. so why didn't the bills move in the next two congresses? it is not like congress simply forgot that there were franchise bills pending before them, because president duterte himself chose to keep reminding congress every chance he could (may 2017 and december 2019, among other times) to not renew the franchise. in may 2017, he launched a tirade at the network, and told congress, ""no need to renew."" last year, he told the lopezes to simply sell the network, because congress would not be giving them a franchise. ""ang inyong franchise mag-end next year if you are expecting na ma-renew 'yan, i'm sorry. you're out. i will see to it that you're out.""- dec. 3, 2019. and there were many other incidents in between. of course, you all remember these cases, don't you?the president's supporters happily gloated at the projected demise of the network. just review your timelines, i'm sure you can't miss them, unless you deleted them as soon as presidential spokesman harry roque declared the other day that the president is now neutral on the issue and that he has already forgiven abs-cbn for its transgressions. whatever the president's present state of mind re abs-cbn, the fact is that the past four years provide context to the entire timeline that would be irresponsible to ignore. but the narrative is being changed. just the other day, i bristled when one congressman insinuated that i was being malicious for asking him how the president's four years of campaigning against the network's franchise had figured in how we ended up here. this is context that doesn't even need much research. in fact, to not bring it up would even be irresponsible. thing is, politics tends to be blind to context. -should congress have given the network a renewal? that is what congressional hearings are for. unfortunately, it was done on the 11th hour, for reasons i will allow you to divine on your own. for those who have many legal questions about alleged violations (channels vs frequencies, pay per view vs free, taxes, etc) committed by the network, please do watch the video of the hearing again. i will not detail the findings here anymore, because that would just encourage laziness. i would say, though, that all the invited government agencies cleared the network of liabilities, except for a small fine. in our interview with the ntc's deputy commissioner edgardo cabarios yesterday, he was pretty clear as well - for them, the station has no pending issues that could have blocked the renewal of a franchise. the thing is, a franchise is a political vote, and it never even came to a vote. so while the station qualifies technically, the all-important question now is whether it qualifies politically. -so it comes to this - abs-cbn may not broadcast on radio and tv because it had no congressional franchise. that franchise application never got off the ground because congress declared it was too busy with other things. in fact, if congress had its way, the hearings would have started after the president's sona in july this year. go figure. -on the other hand, did congress refuse to act because of the president's very vocal, very angry, and very public orders to congress (""no need to renew,"" may 2017 speech; ""ipag bili na ninyo iyan,"" december 2019 speech) not to renew the station's franchise? i just ask these questions because these are the context of our times. i leave it to you to answer on your own. but remember the context. -just an added detail. there have been cases when broadcast companies continued to operate long after their franchise lapsed. the 11 radio stations of the cbcp continued operating for more than two years after their franchise lapsed in 2017, before they were given a new one. not even a provisional authority was issued by the ntc. asked why this does not apply as well to abs-cbn, cabarios told us that there was a complaint against abs-cbn, so they cannot just ignore the lapsed franchise, like they did with the cbcp radio stations. -to those who use the justification that press freedom is a right, but broadcasting is a privilege, i say you are correct in the wording. but i would also say that you delude yourselves by memorizing words, and failing to understand the principles. when an administration goes to great lengths to shut down a platform of media because the principal does not like the network, that is an attack on the media. bring them to court. sue them. build a case. you have all the departments at your disposal. there is even that archaic and much abused libel provision in the revised penal code. when you just use your numbers in congress for a political attack, that may be ""legal"", but that, to anyone with a basic grasp of english, is still an attack on the press. in the end, it is about controlling editorial content with methods beyond the purview of law, using your powers to influence what stories are covered, and how they are presented. not all attacks against the media are done with a gun. make no mistake, every administration does this, but some do it to different degrees - some with intimidation, others do it with a lot of screaming and arm-twisting. others simply order an all-out assault. erap's method vs the inquirer and my old the manila times was the ad boycott, and ordering investigations against the owners of the media companies until the gokongweis were forced to sell the newspaper. all still legal. yet these were clearly attacks on the press. it's all a bit difficult to fit in a meme, i have to admit. but there has to be a good reason why our head takes up 8-10 percent of our body weight (depending on when your last haircut was). in this case, the president has made a big issue over alleged bias of the network, and its refusal to air some of his campaign ads. instead of filing suit for these personal complaints, he campaigned for almost four years using his position and his official platforms of public speeches, and even radio television malacanang or rtvm, against that network's franchise renewal. if anything, it was an attack on a media organization (organizations, really, if you go by the record of the last four years) using an office. and then finally, a political process, the grant of a congressional franchise, was the switch that shut off the power. did the president personally pull the plug the other day? after four years, that question is very interesting, but no longer material. legal, yes, but still an attack. we complained, we rallied, we protested whenever erap, or gma or aquino lashed out at the press, and that is all on record for everyone to see. aquino even liked to complain that we were so unfair to him (pero dilawan kami, diba? bakit ganun?). yet it still surprises some of you that we rally to the banner of press freedom when one of us is shut down? seriously? where have all of you been for the past four years? -there are those who argue that press freedom is alive anyway because there are still other media organizations operating. that is correct. but do not use that line to conclude that the press was never under attack. to say that there is no attack because we are still publishing and writing is like saying that hitler did not attack the jews because not all of them were killed. weird logic? that's the point. i write this because there are those who fail to understand what we do, and blame us for it. there are those who rightly hold us to account, yet are angered when we hold government to account. you should demand more from your government, in the same way that you should also demand more from your media. and yes, admittedly, we also need to demand more from ourselves as well. they all should go together. abs-cbn, during my time, was far from perfect, but i had worked with, to my mind, some of the best journalists i've had the pleasure of knowing. and many of them did put up a good fight, despite the imperfections of the institution. of course there were the others there, but never mind. encourage good media by patronizing them, watching them, reading them, een criticizing them, instead of relying on your fb and saying, mabuti na lang may facebook, dun na lang ako umaasa. you cannot just complain about bad programming if you are one who really patronizes inane shows instead of good programs. and yes, there are good programs out there, it's just that not enough people are willing to vote with their remote. it is not difficult to just be agreeable, and to go with the flow of a popular populist government. but the fourth estate is not supposed to do that, even if some of us have already signed on. if it was easy, then it wouldn't be journalism, now would it? but then again, how many people would agree with that statement? if you got this far, then congratulations for being very patient. sometimes i still wonder if people really read long posts, or if they just automatically troll away even if i just write *lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.* *in secula seculorum.* amen (the first line of loren ipsum is the usual typesetting placeholder, and does not really mean anything. the last line is latin for ""forever and ever."" no connection whatsoever with the post, it was just meant to confuse you)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/gfo1wv/ed_lingaos_statement_on_the_abscbn_franchise/,8 05 2020
A Word from the Frontline,"warning: long post ahead due to context. i just got my license last october and opted for a year off. i was tired, i didn’t feel like i was ready for residency, and i definitely had plenty of personal issues that needed sorting out. let it not be said that med school is an ordeal in on itself. the boards were just the icing on the cake; and what a sour tasting icing it was. i digress. when i said “take a year off”, i simply mean that i wanted to stretch out on my own, finally do non med related things ive been keeping off the table for so long, and still keep sharp the skills and knowledge i’ve gained—yes, by working as a licensed physician. after all, a boy’s got to eat. serendipitous as it may seem, a few days after the announcement of the board passers, there was an opening in a public hospital near where i lived. the pay was considerable, the schedule (24 ++ hour duties notwithstanding) was alright and there was a chain of referral present. since it was a specialist hospital i (theoretically) did not need to worry about certain cases. while adulting was hard (literal na parang itatae kayo sa kalsada about the many intricacies of life that med school never bothered to even mention—unless you had a job before med), it was a minor irritation. lesson learned pa din and it definitely won’t do to be charged for tax evasion. the first few months were fun; if more hectic than i assumed it would be. the chain of command was surprisingly supportive unlike what was experienced by some of us during clerkship and/or internship. while i did my best, i still made a few mistakes—unsurprising as this was the first real time i’d be managing things on my own. not once was i lambasted nor abused, and for that i was grateful. constructive criticism and proper advise is so much better than the petty powertripping that seems so rampant in medicine—training or otherwise. skills remained sharp, i got to know great new people and explored my horizons both professional and personal in ways i don’t think residency would ever let me. call me pretentious, but maybe for some, it really is better to learn how to fly first before you walk. also, it really is something else to finally be earning for yourself and be able to give a bit in return to those who have supported you the whole time. all good things must come to an end; or as ned stark more fittingly put, “winter is coming.” come late december, everyone seemed to be happy, still so full of christmas cheer when there came news that in china, never-before-seen pathogen has begun infecting people. it didn’t seem like a big deal at the time, but it helped to keep tabs. soon enough, the virus we now call sars cov 2 which causes covid 19 was on the news everyday. soon, there were clamors to suspend flights to and from china and other affected areas. temporary naman, just until the crisis abates. i’m pretty sure a lot of you have seen the news on that last january-early feb. and then it started. at first, they were either foreign nationals here for a vacation or for whatever other purpose or ofws, having come from a high risk country with fever, cough and/or colds. fever, cough and/or colds. as simple as they may sound, the sheer number of pathogenic entities that can cause any or all of these is simply mind-boggling. this is where history-taking and physical examination comes in. it was often said that 95% of the time, a doctor can get it right simply through those. lies kill, and we would learn how true those words are in due time. going back, the lab exams, radiologic imaging etc are there not to diagnose for us, but to act as supporting evidence. they serve to identify what the pathogen is (for us to give specific treatment if need be), to see if the patient is getting better (hence repeat testing for a lot of illnesses), and to see if there is anything new needs to be addressed. that’s the remaining 5%. so yeah, it was a trickle at first. manageable. or so it seemed. that trickle soon turned into a stream; regular hospital protocol simply wouldn’t do anymore so the admin made drastic changes. effectively, the hospital i worked in became a specialty center for covid 19 with those changes. our job? the vanguard. the frontline. before anyone thinks it’s unfair and too risky, our seniors had the far riskier job of actually handling the day-to-day issues of inpatients including those who have turned out positive. we adjusted. we made our pleas for compensation heard, and at the very least we were given what was due. hopefully, that fairness stays that way for the duration. having done my internship in the biggest public hospital myself, the eventual frontline seemed a familiar sight. the major difference was the fear. fear spreads faster and goes deeper than any other plague can. it started with that report about the first locally transmitted case of covid 19. suddenly the people came non-stop, some outright demanding to be tested despite being told and being shown the guidelines that we follow. to placate such people is a balancing act in being professional and in keeping one’s temper down. it is immensely tiring for mind, body and spirit to do so on a repeated basis. as of right now, the most at risk seem to still be the old and/or those with debilitating chronic illnesses. they are the ones who should be tested and admitted if need be. there are no guidelines for vip testing. god forbid the day there would be. we had to swallow the bile, seeing the pompous and entitled put themselves first before the people they had sworn to serve. heck, ‘til now, none of the medical staff in the hospital have ever been swabbed. the reality that we and the other staff members were but lowly ants that can only serve and not be heard (at least not out loud) was not missed. even our seniors who had a negative opinion on the matter had no choice. rizal once stated it so graciously in the character of kabesang tales and the friars who deigned on his rights and what he knew was just. “siya ang palayok, kawali ang korporasyon.” go figure. that stream soon turned into a river; more changes were wrought in our line of work. more struggles. more. more. more. our seniors had to pull off alternating shifts; that is to say they go on 24++ hour duties every other day, supposedly to keep their immunities up. it does little to lessen the risk of their contracting the virus which by that point had caused all of luzon to be locked down by the increasingly erratic president. most of us juniors couldn’t risk going home. our parents were and continue to be at risk. they are getting on with years and if they were to get sick, then science—objective and simultaneously emotionless—dictated that they were most likely to suffer severe manifestations. the communities where we come home too will also suffer thanks to the draconian measures we are all forced to live with. at the very least, the hospital admin gave us lodging and food, and we are grateful for the good samaritans who have and continue to help out in what ways they can. i cannot say the same for other healthcare workers from other institutions. each day brings more patients, and each day the atmosphere becomes more rife with fear or so it seems. the number of cases is rising daily. the risk of contracting the disease (or any such similar ones) is a constant companion especially for we who actually have to handle patients. the risk is probably similar too for any such patient who decides to get checked in our now-densely packed institutions by simple proximity. remember; droplet transmission has an effective radius of 6 feet. one cough. one sneeze. a lot of people. that’s all it would take. outside the hospital, the news still leaves a lot to the imagination, but what is shown seems to reflect a similar condition. it’s morbidly interesting how a virus is all it would take to lay bare the many, many faults and inadequacies of the system we follow and are forced to endure. rather than lead with a sense of gravity and purpose, we get sad excuses, senseless statements (e.g. “the kit”) and many such other examples. instead of a medical solution, we get a militaristic one. hell, a lot of these soldiers probably don’t have adequate training (if at all) for an epidemic. the masks most of them wear are about as useful as tissue paper against sars cov 2. one can hardly blame them for that kind of ignorance at least. it is the possibility of abuse of power that keeps heads turning and fingers crossed. such abuse has happened before after all, lest we forget. what is incredible is that some people have the gall to defend these measures without being offered enough aid nor explanation. instead “ano bakit? may naiambag ka ba? sumunod ka na lang kasi <expletive>” has become a de facto reason if you can even call it that. i digress again. the frontline sees us and our fellow healthcare workers exposed in more ways than one. i am lucky that our institution seems to have enough for our staff which number few to begin with. we make do with what limited manpower we have because we don’t have a choice. for the larger institutions (public and private), i’ve seen and heard from friends also on the frontline how they have to improvise simply due to a shortage of stocks that those in power are supposed to provide. manpower too is fast becoming a problem; even old doctors and nurses who shouldn’t pull such long shifts anymore are forced to take the field despite the higher risk they have due to the curse of age. the virus (and the menagerie of other microbes in the workplace) is not the only thing we are exposed to; healthcare workers have to grind too for a living, just like anyone else. work from home is never an option. imagine during the first few days of the lockdown, not a single fig it seemed was given regarding the problem of commuting to and from the workplace or alternatively where they can stay to limit exposure. contrary to what most think, nobody gets rich by working in healthcare alone. most of us don’t have cars too. before the present transpo measures were placed, each institution had to think of ways on how to manage an otherwise crippling problem. sari-sariling diskarte in other words. imagine that. it’s even more harrowing now to know some of these healthcare workers have been thrown out like the lepers of old by paranoid landlords who consider them harbingers of disease. mind you, healthcare workers are among those supposed to have a pass to go to and from their place of work for obvious reasons. we have a hard enough time with what’s going on. misinformation and paranoia only make it more difficult and dangerous for everyone. what more for the common filipino who holds no exemption? i’ve felt helpless whenever a patient has asked me how they’re supposed to go home or to pay for private services. i have no true answer nor remedy for that. compound those with the previously existing problems we have in our healthcare system. most, if not all of us, have families; and the possibility of never seeing them again is always around the corner. as i write this, a total of 10 doctors, most of whom had been in the high risk age group, have perished due to covid 19. it is a reminder of mortality; a reminder that not everyone can be saved. forget that a lot of frontliners are relatively young. we die too. the ones in charge of running the country, flaccid as they are, seem to think that the death of one is a tragedy, the death of a million is a statistic. i do hope i am proven wrong in that regard. the personal toll is no less painful, perhaps even moreso; for patients and those whose lives have been forfeit, most of all. there are dreams now that may never be realized, loves that may never again come alive. there are roads in life closed mayhaps forever; not just for we in the vanguard, but for anyone who holds such hopes. it makes one think of what could have been avoided simply by imposing those would-be travel bans. alas, it appears that we have been in damage control ever since. while we (healthcare workers—no, mr. cayetano, sit down) stand united in trying to stem the torrent, it is unsurprising and most unfortunate that even we are bickering and arguing about what to do next. then again, we’re people too. we have flaws too. i’ve said previously, we die too. there are at least ten names now that can attest to that. we are also afraid. but we can’t choose to show that. we want answers from above, same as everyone. when we make ourselves heard, there are consequences that follow. many such answers given too are not all assuring and leaves many a question to boil in a fevered mind. forgive the comparison, but some of us do feel like soldiers being made to go to war without arms. we can only hope that everyone does their part. is this a war we can win? certainly. but we can’t win it alone",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/fs8rql/a_word_from_the_frontline/,31 03 2020

AMA: I am an HCW who received their first dose of the Sinovac COVID19 Vaccine at a government hospital today. Ask me anything!,"edit - 5 hour solo ama grabe. thanks to all the participants in this ama. hopefully maraming natutunan. will try to do one more later today pag nakatulog na ako, if the mods allow. thanks everybody. going to remain anonymous, but have verified myself and me being a vaccine recipient with the mods. i am late 30-something male doctor in a government hospital in metro manila and outlying provinces who, after much personal deliberation and getting advice from my friends and colleagues in more relevant medical subspecialties, had last-minute decided today to volunteer and receive the first dose of the sinovac vaccine for covid19 (coronavac). i received my dose around 3pm today, and slated to receive the second dose of coronavac before the end of the month, supplies hopefully allowing. i decided to make an ama to share and use my experience today for those of us in the /ph subreddit who have any questions regarding my personal experience with the vaccine today, as well as any relevant questions pinoy redditors may regarding not just the chinese made vaccine, but vaccines in general. to begin, here are some of my experiences today: 1. the clearance process was surprisingly strict and ordered. even as a doctor, i had to get clearances from internal medicine and family medicine doctors who took a detailed personal medical history to assess for any potential reactions a patient receiving the vaccine may incur during inoculation, as well as any comorbidities that needed to be checked and monitored. the only contraindication for the vaccine was either being under the age of 18 or over 59, so senior citizens in the staff were not allowed to my knowledge. 2. depending on your pain tolerance, i personally felt little during the needle insertion, which is done in the deltoid muscle of the upper arm/shoulder. however when i finished work and went home, while the localized swelling had subsided, the pain actually increased which made lifting my arm a little painful. as i type this the pain is still there. decided to put some ice on it and see what happens tomorrow morning. these are the first things i could say from the top of my head. ask me anything!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/lw0grz/ama_i_am_an_hcw_who_received_their_first_dose_of/,2 03 2021

"Where to Look for Medical Assistance, DAD IS IN VEGETATIVE STATE amidst COVID-19 Pandemic","i'm sorry but i don't know where else to go. so i'm going to give it a try here. please help us, where can we find government assistance or any financial assistance to help is cover hospital bills for my dad? he does not have medical or life insurance. only has philhealth and his senior citizen discount. we are just 3 siblings caring for him, and all of us are barely earning due to the lockdown. our families have tried sending help, but they are also barely surviving so they can't send a lot. please help us, we don't know what else to do. this started in the morning of august 12. we were happily having breakfast and my 70 y.o. dad was about to sit down on the couch and suddenly collapsed. he had already lost his bodily functions by then. we rushed him immediately to many hospitals, but sadly were rejected one after another. we were only able to receive proper treatment in the afternoon at uerm, but they also had full bed capacity. he waited in the er for hours while we searched for a hospital. regrettably, we were only able to get a room in cardinal santos, a very expensive hospital, because it was the only one with an icu ready and it was already 4am. at the time, we prioritized getting my dad admitted without thinking about the possible charges. my dad was diagnosed with aphasic stroke, wherein the dominant part of the left side of his brain was hit by the blood clot. this stopped all comprehensive functions (sight, hearing, talking, and eating). he can slightly move his limbs but only when he feels pain. he is conscious but can only open his eyes, which will only last for a few seconds and he will sleep again. this is because his brain is still swelling due to the blood clot and causes him to feel drowsy. because he can't control his throat muscles, he can't cough out the accumulated mucus in his lungs. we're praying that this will not lead to pneumonia. after 3 days, we finally got him to get transferred to a regular room so we could be with him. but this did not mean he was in a better condition. we could hear his heavy breathing due to phlegm build-up. we were advised to have surgery wherein part of his skull will be removed to allow his swollen brain to breathe, but this would still lead him to become vegetative because of his old age. it will only allow him to stay alive while being attached to a machine. the surgery is also very expensive, minimum fee is at ₱800k and above. we were also asked to intubate him but we also refused because of the risk of his heart stopping. right now, we are fighting for him but we don't want to push him to become alive for our sake at the expense of him suffering even more. that's why we decided to take care of him personally in a regular room, no matter how long it takes. but this required us to take turns watching him, affecting our daily jobs and it is just us 3 siblings who can take care of him. it's just been 4 days now but the bill is already at ₱273k without the 20% senior citizen discount. we've been asking for financial help from our friends and family, but they are not enough especially because we don't know for how long my dad will be staying in the room. if you have any idea where we can ask for help, please let us know. your prayers will also be a big help to my father. thank you so much.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/iamb77/where_to_look_for_medical_assistance_dad_is_in/,16 08 2020

Yet no further cases here.,"by now, the australian case is quite well known but here it is anyways https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/news/pages/20200304_06.aspx confirmed case, woman in her 60s who arrived back in australia on march 3, is believed to have returned from the philippines. her travel details are being obtained and will be disclosed if she posed a risk to any other passengers on her flight. taiwan case disclosed last night https://www.cdc.gov.tw/en/bulletin/detail/e2thdyns-cy3xcjy0ebd4q?typeid=158 case #44 is an over-30-year-old male who resides in northern taiwan. he traveled to the philippines with his friends from february 28 to march 3. he had diarrhea in the philippines on march 2. after he returned to taiwan, case #44 went to a clinic due to having a dry throat and tiredness on march 3. he went to a hospital and was reported as a suspected case on march 4. infection with covid-19 was laboratory-confirmed in the case on march 5. related investigation suggested it is an imported case linked to the philippines. please note, i have written ph ""may have"" exported. i am not able to definitively say both cases originated here. they could have gotten it from another traveller on flights sure, but it is likely that those people either caught the disease in the philippines, or have since spread the disease to others in the philippines. ph needs more proactive testing / examination of pneumonia cases, as well as a strategy to test the asymptomatic cases. there are definitely cases here that simply are not getting caught and tested. be careful all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/fe2pai/according_to_2_cases_australia_and_taiwan_ph_may/,5 03 2020
Is it worth it to work at McDo?,"more than two months ago, after sending resumes through different jobs, i finally got an interview. i got hired in this famous fast-food restaurant we all know, mcdo. i applied through a job fair that happened in my city, and they immediately told me to attend the interview by next week. i passed the interview, arranged all the needed documents (which took me a month tapos ang gastos pa), orientation, and now we are currently in training. so basically, yung mcdo na papasukan ko is ginagawa palang (by october magbubukas na), lahat kaming magtatrabaho doon eh bago palang at kami rin daw yung magiging pioneer sa branch na yun. i also made a few friends during orientation and training. tinatrain kami sa ibang branch muna since hindi pa nagagawa yung branch na pagtatrabahuhan namin. during uh, training, hindi naman gaano kabigat yung trabaho namin sa station since dalawa kaming trinain na sabay eh. but when we are about to practice na, god doon ko na naramdaman kung gaano nakakapagod at stressful ang pagtrabaho sa mcdo. nung nagpractice na kasi magisa nalang ako tapos kasama ko pa e yung mga mismong crew doon sa branch na pinagpraktisan ko, kaya nakakapressure talaga haha ang bilis kasi nila tapos grabe rin talaga pag rush hour. tapos minsan napagsasabihan pa na ang bagal ko daw etc (mga te please bago palang ako pero gets ko rin naman bat nasasabi yun), pero mostly mga mababait naman sila at palabiro lols kaya ayos din. nung second practice day ko which was nung sunday, grabe nakakapagod haha tapos na pa overtime pa ako kasi hindi dumating ung katurn over ko. wala pa akong tulog non pero maayos naman ung work ko. nagkasakit ako the next day. grabe sakit ng katawan ko, naginit din katawan ko :(( hanggang ngayon may sakit padin. kaya napaisip isip ako kung worth it ba talaga magtrabaho sa mcdo? dito kasi sa city namin p54 per hour lang yung sahod. ewan ko ba kung itutuloy ko ba to lol ang bigat ng trabaho ang liit ng sahod. balak ko nga sana mag apply sa call center atleast doon mataas taas daw, plus yun ung sinusuggest ng mga friends ko na mag apply ako sa call center. should i resign or should i continue it kasi sayang naman ung oras na nilaan ko para dito? :( edit: i forgot to mention that i'm a student, well currently on a gap sem so i'll continue being a uni student by january",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/xj7jqd/is_it_worth_it_to_work_at_mcdo/,20 09 2022

Why doesn’t the survey reflect what’s happening?,"most people are trained to think logically and rely heavily on scientific evidence that we now describe what’s happening in the survey results and sorties as a paradox. still a very conservative way to think right? we wouldn’t want to cry out baseless accusations for fear of seeming uneducated or illogical or emotional would we now? okay so let’s ask questions then and examine what’s before us. first, the percentage of voter preference for marcos jr. it’s more than the majority and even described as unprecedented. no candidate has ever gotten that much voter preference. the tainted past of this candidate regardless of his strong misinformation network is already suspicious, 60% voter preference is not realistic. strong misinformation network notwithstanding. let’s circle back to that later. granted that the disinformation network has been working since 2016 to revise and erase the rottenness of the marcos era the question is where are those informed enough to know what really happened? quickly, in the facts first podcast a professor has studied the misinformation in social media and its role in this election; and she has said that as early as 2016, soon as marcos jr lost there were already youtube channels churning out false information favoring him. so back to the question where are these anti marcos folks? a) were they swayed by the revisionism? b) there were so few of those people to begin with that the disinformation has really taken hold c) is the anger and disappointment towards the pnoy administration so strong that they would be swayed there’s a sub question under letter c. wouldn’t these people think yeah, pnoy’s admin might’ve been flawed but isn’t the marcos admin much worse? so why go back to a system that’s even more broken? if surveys were a snapshot of a given time period shouldn’t certain events in that time frame affect the surveys? a veteran political strategist alan german, said that marcos jr’s refusal to attend debates negatively affected him. he also said that it was a considerable backlash as they had a qss - quick sentiment scan done on social media. he was asked if this was an echo chamber and said that no because it was done on accounts not associated with their camp. how come the surveys didn’t reflect this? also the tax evasion case against him was highlighted again. one would ask, are the majority of the filipinos so blinded and fooled that they wouldn’t take these into account? regarding the surveys themselves. let’s just say this out in the open. and this is not widely asked even. who’s commisioning them? the manpower involved has to be paid. and these surveys are not used for studies. these surveys are used as a pr tool. so let’s take note of that as well. aside from that elephant in the room question, these are itemized questions and observation surveys may say that sample selection is random but we also need to know about how the data was gathered in terms of the interview itself; or how the data gatherers conducted the survey. questions like 1. are they properly trained did they conduct the interview in a professand neutral tone of voice for example as an aside, there are survey questionnaires that have a certain amount attach to them meaning each questionnaire filled out would mean an interviewer would be paid. also there are anecdotal reports of interviewrs filling out the surveys themselves ( due to tiredness etc.) 2. control mechanisms implemented to ensure accuracy of the protocols in data collection; (criterion # 2 was taken from a statement released by the up school of statistics in response to survey legitimacy and kalye surveys.) as far as i know these surveys don’t discuss this in their survey report we can safely say that these are blind spots for all of us who refer to surveys. i think these questions/observations are moot if the survey is just a pr tool commissioned by a “confidential client” that can not be disclosed by the survey firm. so here it is. when the numbers are not adding up we usually don’t trust what our eyes are telling us and we conservatively give preference to the scientific data. but isn’t there also a saying about how the simplest answer is the correct answer. how about the idea that the numbers are not consistent with what we are seeing and feeling simply because they are lying. let’s just go back to the voter preference mentioned earlier, it seems more likely now that it’s another tactic. one, for those voters who tend to vote for a likely winner / bandwagon effect. and to layout the groundwork that this candidate is the clear winner for when they lose and stage a protest. remember if they use misinformation and propaganda isn’t the survey another propaganda tool to be misused? just look at the history of fraud and depth of deception done by these people and tell me that survey manipulation is a stretch.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/t7tqwj/why_doesnt_the_survey_reflect_whats_happening/,6 03 2022

Just diagnosed with HIV,"hi. i (23m) just got diagnosed with hiv. i will still undergo a confirmatory test on wednesday to see if i really do have the virus. i only took 2 rapid antigen tests and they came back positive, and the test kits are highly accurate. when i took my first antigen test on august 20 and got the result, it was a weird feeling. i have been very sickly for almost a year now, and now that i have my results, i finally know why. i just want to get this off my chest. i have already accepted my diagnosis and i'm glad that receiving my diagnosis wasn't so bad as others. maybe it has not sunken it yet? idk. i hope that i'd really come into terms with this chronic illness. what's really bothersome for me is, i am a person with big, big dreams. i have always been looking forward to the future. right now, i am a graduating student practicing physical therapy. the thing is, when i got my diagnosis, i wasn't afraid of how deadly or how potentially life-threatening it is. instead, i was more afraid of how it can potentially impact my life from now on. i've always had a map, a direction of where i wanted to go in my life, but now, idk what to do anymore. i don't know what kinds of opportunities that were just stripped off from me, and i am yet to find out. i definitely know that life is going to be different from now on, and nothing has prepared me for this. i can't even tell my parents about this. from my family, i just told my sister. luckily, treatment is going to be for free and that's convenient so i don't have to rely on my parents. huge shoutout to loveyourself! they have been amazing in delivering their service. it brings me comfort to just see how passionate the people who are working there. as for me, i'm still yet to see. it's going to be a different life from now on. i know i got this, i just have to continue moving forward update: hello, i've read all of your comments! thank you all so much for your affirming words 🙏🏼 i'm very glad na i sparked this discourse and people are getting educated by it! i feel so much better than yesterday when i posted it, it's just amazing na there are understanding people! i would just like to answer some very common questions from the comments: how did you acquire it? - i engage in very risky sexual behaviors. mostly m2m, and i do it unprotected sometimes. mostly oral lahat, wasn't really into penetrative sex. for 3 years, i've mostly engaged in oral sex lang with people i met online and usually ako yung *insertive* sa role. since then, twice lang ako nakapag anal but puro protected. i'm thinking na maybe i got it through oral sex and take note ah na it's rare to acquire it via oral sex. this is a lesson to all! what were your symptoms? - for almost a year, i was very sickly talaga. september last year, i contracted amoebiasis and i didn't get treated for it until january when i was hospitalized due to sever malnutrition and dehydration. they did try to rule out hiv while i was treated, but since i had a primary diagnosis at that time, they didn't bother testing hiv nalang. over those months, onting ulan lang, i'd get sick na. it was every week na i'd get a fever! again, i did not think na it was because of hiv since i contracted amoebiasis at the time. the reason why i delayed my treatment lang was sobrang hirap kumuha ng med cert from my school. plus, i didn't want to make up for any missed activities or exams and at that time it was hell months sa gawain and all. they had to isolate me for 2 weeks kasi i had diarrhea and it was a symptom of covid (i know, pretty messed up yung clinic namin). i know it's very ironic of me, a medical course student, who chose to be sick than getting treated dahil lang sa school works. fast forward to february this year when i was discharged, it seemed like i never really got better. i was still having stomach problems and my oral thrush came back, even after weeks of taking prescription medications for it. i had enlarged lymph nodes around my neck to which my doctor prescribed me with antibiotics and nag shrink din naman yung lymph nodes ko. since feb ang masasabi ko lang na pinaka complaint ko is just the fatigue. i didn't have the energy that i used to have. and i just notice na i'm weaker. maffeel mo talaga na something is wrong sa body mo. that's the best way to describe it. what made you decide to get tested? - it was a message from the universe. may nakita lang ako na ad sa facebook by self care about free testing kits that they give out and get delivered to your doorstep. i ordered mine ng august 13 and dumating yung kit ng august 20 (you decide the date that's most convenient for you cause you have to sign some paperwork before it gets handed to you). i was curious lang din to know my status. how much will the treatment cost? - free. as long as may philhealth insurance ka, it's gonna be for free. don ako sa loveyourself sa shaw boulevard pumunta. but, some testing procedures are not going to be for free. i will update on this soon since i will be going back to the doctor ng wednesday. but treatment is generally for free",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/162t88p/just_diagnosed_with_hiv/,27 08 2023

"Did I get Covid & just recovered very quickly, or just another flu?","just curious if anyone’s also experienced this, especially since there’s a mini-surge in people getting sick in manila. i know so many people who got covid-symptoms yet tested negative in their antigen tests. my sister got exposed to someone with covid symptoms. day 2 after exposure, they notified us of their symptoms, and in day 3 we also started feeling sick. i already got covid before and i had a hunch it’s covid again since the symptoms felt all-too-familiar (but this time, milder). my sister took an antigen on day 3 and she tested negative. her friends who were also sick also bore negative antigen results. i took an antigen test on day 4 and i also tested negative. however, i also took an rt-pcr test the next day (day 5) to be sure (which also showed negative results). i already feel much better at day 5, but it got me thinking if we really got covid or not? because all the symptoms i felt when i got infected 4 months ago were exactly the same (headache, fatigue, sore throat, cough, runny & clogged nose, fever), except milder (didn’t get a fever this time). i also immediately took medicine for covid on day 3 when i felt the symptoms (so that might be a factor as well to the decreased symptoms & fast recovery?) or maybe a new milder covid strain? or a new flu",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/zrucf4/did_i_get_covid_just_recovered_very_quickly_or/,21 12 2022

Re: Igan's post on stop census as commented by a pathologist in East Avenue,"my relative is one of those pathologists na included sa list of names dun sa letter na inupload ni igan sa instagram niya. additional context, my relative hates the admin for being inept and duque for not being able to control the outbreak in contrast to how well the mers-cov was contained. first of all, naasar siya na pinost yun with their full names. they got doxxed hard by a journalist. edit: imagine not being one of the two na nagpost publicly pero nandoon name mo tapos marerecognize ng condo na isa ka sa mga nagwowork sa east ave. this is as responsible as live reporting the hostage taking incident sa luneta. second, legit na naging overloaded yung morgue nila na merong cadavers sa morgue hallway... and some of those mabaho na because 4 days na. third, fail yung naubusan ng body bags ang major hospital and had to beg a senator. fourth, bad idea ang hindi ideclare ang actual deaths and cases. low numbers would result in lower amount of aid lalo na dahil nagseset-in na yung donor's fatigue (i.e. nauubusan din ng funds para sa ppe na dinodonate sa mga frontliners). not as many na daw nung first two weeks compared sa ngayon. fifth, di nila susundin ang order to stop counting without a memo or a directive. and if magkaroon man ng actual document, madali lang daw ileak yun. it just so happens na they can't test as many and as fast (~50 per swabber on a 24hr duty). will confirm in the morning if ang priority nila na matest ay yung mga buhay (edit: yung releasing of results instead of the swabbing itself) update: as is yung pag test sa lab. ang priority sa lab test ng samples ay para sa health workers. tl;dr the stop count order does not exist. di niya alam kung saan nanggaling yun and yun ang di verified sa mga inexpose ni igan. p.s. this is a throwaway account. p.p.s. they really are going to need more ppes if this quarantine gets extended further kaya they would report the cases as is. faking low numbers is bad for them. p.p.p.s. naasar siya nung sinabi ko na they are fucked worse than elsa jean kasi they are fucked in more ways than elsa was in that blacked video. edit: piper perri pala... pero nagets naman niya so...",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/fzcvhv/re_igans_post_on_stop_census_as_commented_by_a/,11 04 2020

(very apt today with rotc to be forced down students' throats again soon) kamasupra? poorman’s grave? buddy singing ‘tama ka’ with an intro about beginning to like the song as he got older (implying that he hated it before) was superb. everysong where raimund was lead vocals was included. paru-parong ningning! slo mo! and he was visibly having fun singing each of them. \--but probably as trade-off, other hits were skipped. no more time for kailan, harana. would have loved to hear as well tindahan ni aling nena, blue jeans, tuwing umuulan… and any one of the no royalty fillers. the eheads was the first band confident and hardheaded enough to have senseless 'ganjazz 'and zappa rant as official tracks; would have been perfect to do one in this concert. but no one gets all their wishes. \--ely was earnest. i watched pupil live several years back in a bar, and i’m pretty sure he was phoning it in then. he was eager to do his best singing here from the get-go. \--superb backup (or true main?) musicians. at several points, you know that the rhythms and leads (much of the load, really) were not being strummed by the band anymore. there were also miscues and missteps throughout, even in the middle of a song, but audrey dionisio and mikey amistoso were saving all of them. and mad, mad respect for jazz nicolas who was doing keyboards, triangles… might even have a cowbell somewhere there. and he was truly elated playing in the ‘gig,’ from beginning to end! \--i like the eksena where raimund stood up from his drums during pare ko and just roamed around the stage, shooting with a gopro, while holding in his other hand a glass of red wine. one can interpret this as the other alpha male of the group egotistically prancing about, or simply someone wanting to drink during a multi-million concert, in the middle of a song, and actually doing it. ely tugged him to sing a line of pare ko. he did. \--all of us are aware of the issue with marcus adoro. there are people who are defending and emphasizing on the independence of art from the artist. there are also parties saying that the exchange posted by his daughter is between a daughter and a father, that bottom line that’s marcus’s way of ‘talking’ to his daughter. this is clearly wrong. to say that there’s no anguish caused by marcus’s words is plain wrong. \--what i’m looking for though is whether or not marcus continued supporting his daughter. there’s no info here. if he’s not supporting, i surely would have skipped this or joined the chorus of removing him from the event. \--i thought marcus will sing panahon, as he rehearsed. but he just inconspicuously occupied his far side of the stage throughout, and remained the one bandmember who did not have a solo. and the monitors were just scatteringly focusing on him. \--i entered college when eraserheads was already very popular, but they were still playing sunken garden at very cheap (or free!) prices. they were also joining our rallies and strumming a tune or two in the mob. they were never greedy. if they need the retirement money right now, they all deserve to get the dough. \--people are also harping now about the moneygrab that is the upcoming world tour. of course it’s going to be a moneygrab. why not maximize the rehearsals and all the preps you spent months for? and again, they were not one of those fabulously-living stars even during their heyday. it’s time for the band to secure retirement money. \--a friend was warning hard about the disorganized mess that happened just a few days before, in a ben&ben concert. this one was relatively organized. the gates separated and there were plenty of ticket attendants at each entrance. (you can see how far even the ‘gold’ section was just from walking between gates). there’s just an unavoidable horde at the end leaving the venue. i can imagine cars trying to get out of a jam (caused by throngs spilling out of pavements) for hours. i parked at okada, walked back after the concert, and took naiax, did not encounter any gridlock going back to qc. \--prices were falling on the day of the concert. i already got three platinum (later shared to college friends) comped from a supplier. bought three from here at reddit at 60% off sticker (all these tickets were zero cost as printed, sponsor-comped at seller side). a colleague bought two more from facebook marketplace (later shared to clients). a seller was offering me 5k for moshpit two hours before the concert. (another friend got two moshpits bought for 15k total 24hrs before). this discounting is always probable to happen in big, open grounds concerts. \--i watched in vip, because i thought the moshpit was going to be a true narrow cramped moshpit where people stagedive. but it was a wide swath with free spaces, instead. diagrams in posters were vastly inaccurate. \--audience were from all age groups. i’m surprised to see 20-somethings knowing the lyrics better than me (late 30’s). \--i still feel the fatigue from all the standing, jumping, swaying a day after, but it’s mostly happy memories. **if you are overseas and they are touring near you, grab the chance.** i hope they do one more in mnl next year. there was magic in listening to music you have skipped for decades (because of overplaying them at their peak). you get to appreciate again the lyrics that are unpretentious and representative of a generation’s angsts. i want to experience again moments where every single one around me were singing to many songs. all imploring: “puwede bang itigil muna ang pag-ikot ng mundo?”... priceless.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/zwnumx/eraserheads_huling_el_bimbo_concert_personal_notes/,27 12 2022

madalas ko ngang kinukurot at sinasampal ang mukha ko para masiguradong hindi ako nananaginip. &#x200b; apat na taon na kami ng aking mahal na nobya. noong niligawan ko siya, lahat ng mga kaibigan at kapitbahay ko sinabihan ako na huwag ko na raw ituloy dahil bad news daw siya at mapapariwara lamang ako kapag naging kami. na may ""something"" daw ang pamilya nila sa probinsya. bagong lipat lang ako sa lugar na iyon at mag-a-anim na buwan pa lamang doon nang makilala ko ang nobya ko. hindi ako nakinig sa mga sinasabi nila, mga tsismoso at mga tsimosa, at itinuloy ang panliligaw. hindi nagtagal, sinagot din niya ako at talagang sobrang ligaya ko simula noon. lahat ng mga nagsabing mapapariwara raw ako, hindi ko na sila mga kaibigan ngayon. &#x200b; last year lang, nagsimula na kaming mag-live in. kumuha kami ng condo sa taguig at talagang sobrang saya namin. halos wala kaming problema, wala kaming anumang away. at siyempre, dahil iyon sa sinusunod ko ang mga special rules. &#x200b; well, wala naman talaga siyang special rules para sa akin. kung ano ang gusto at ayaw ng mga pangkaraniwang babae sa kanilang nobyo, ganoon din naman siya. sa totoo lang, mas maluwag pa siya sa ibang mga naging girlfriend ko dati. understanding siya, hindi demanding. kaya mahal na mahal ko siya! &#x200b; ang tinutukoy kong mga ""rules"" ay mga simpleng observations ko lamang sa kanya. mga bagay na hindi naman niya ipinagbabawal o dine-demand pero mas maganda kung alam mo. ito ang susi ng aming napakasaya at very smooth na relationship. hindi ba't may kasabihan tayo na, ""ang nagsasama nang matapat at sumusunod sa mga rules ng girlfriend niya, nagsasama nang maluwat."" &#x200b; heto ang mga simpleng rules kaya't perfect ang relationship namin ng aking perfect girlfriend. konti lang naman sila: &#x200b; rule #1. ayaw na ayaw ng girlfriend ko ang mga simbahan. hindi kasi siya religious at ang sabi niya, na-trauma raw siya dahil pinalaki siya ng kanyang lola na super relihiyosa. isa yatang panatiko ang lola niya na miyembro ng isang religious group sa probinsya nila na masasabing parang kulto na nga. kaya't kapag nakakakita siya ng mga churches (kahit anong religion), parang sumasama ang pakiramdam niya. isang beses nga, dumaan ako sa isang kalsada na hindi pamilyar sa akin. ang sabi kasi ng ka-opisina ko, shortcut daw iyon. kaya hindi ko alam na mayroon palang simbahang dadaanan. pagdaan na pagdaan ng kotse ko sa tapat ng simbahan, biglang nagtitili ang girlfriend ko. nagpupumiglas siya, parang nasasaktan ang buong katawan. grabeng trauma siguro ang sinapit niya sa kamay ng lola niya kaya ganoon ang reaksyon niya. kaya binilisan ko ang pagpapatakbo ng kotse ko hanggang sa makalayo kami roon. saka lamang siya huminahon. umiiyak siya, humihingi ng sorry. naiintindihan ko naman siya, wala siyang kasalanan. biktima lamang siya. hinaplos ko ang kanyang buhok at pinunasan ang kanyang mga luha. doon ko lang napansin na namumula ang kanyang noo at mga pisngi. pati mga braso niya ay namumula rin. nang pansinin ko ito, ang sabi niya ay baka nauntog siya o naihampas ang mga braso sa dashboard o sa bintana noong nagpupumiglas siya. niyaya ko siyang dalhin sa ospital pero tumanggi siya. sasabihin ko sanang imposibleng nauntog siya dahil hindi naman mukhang mga pasa ang nasa kanyang mukha at mga braso kundi mukha itong parang nasunog ngunit bigla siyang ngumiti, ang kanyang perpektong mga ngiti, kaya't nakumbisi na rin ako na okay na siya. pagkauwi namin, wala nang anumang bakas sa kanyang mukha na nauntog siya. &#x200b; kaya't kapag bumabiyahe kami, kailangang planuhin ang rutang dadaanan namin at siguraduhing hindi kami malalapit sa anumang simbahan. &#x200b; rule #2. hindi kumakain ng gulay ang girlfriend ko. siguro naman, marami sa inyo ganito ang mga girlfriend. mahilig sa meat pero ayaw kumain ng gulay. nakakatuwa, hindi ba? ako rin naman hindi masyadong mahilig sa gulay. kaya't kung kakain kami o lalabas, laging meat ang kinakain namin. hilig nga niya 'yung mga unli na barbecue. lalo na 'yung mayroong mga lamanloob. paboritong-paborito niya ang atay, intestines, puso, utak, at kung anu-ano pa. mahilig din siya sa dinuguan. minsan nga, isinama niya ako sa isang exclusive restaurant. mga members lang daw ang pwedeng kumain doon at miyembro siya at ang kanyang mga parents. nasa isang subdivision ito na puro mayayaman lamang ang nakatira. sa labas, mukha lang itong malaking mansyon pero pagpasok mo, isa pala itong restaurant. grabe, mayayaman talaga ang mga kumakain doon. may nakita pa nga akong mga artista at mga pulitiko. &#x200b; ang specialty ng restaurant na iyon ay mga lamanloob. tuwang-tuwa ang girlfriend ko nang orderin niya ang soup number 5. pinakain niya sa akin iyon at pinaubos dahil aphrodisiac daw iyon. masaya ko namang sinunod ito kahit na first time ko kumain noon. excited din ako dahil siguradong mapapalaban ako sa mangyayaring bakbakan pagkauwi namin. medyo natigilan lang ako noong una kong makita. ang alam ko kasi, ang main ingredient ng soup number 5 ay ari at bayag ng isang kalabaw. pero, noong pagsandok ko, parang iba ang nakita ko. parang iba ang hugis, parang malapit sa tao. pero siyempre, hindi ko na 'yun pinansin at siguradong imahinasyon ko lamang iyon. &#x200b; rule #3. hindi mahilig magpa-picture at mag-selfie ang aking girlfriend. ayaw na ayaw niya na kuhanan siya ng litrato, lalo na kung stolen. kaya nga kapag lumalabas kami, lagi siyang naka-cap at naka-long sleeves na jacket na may hoodie (ayaw niya rin kasi ang naaarawan). noong bago pa lamang kami, sinubukan ko siyang kuhanan ng picture nang palihim. pagtingin ko, nagtaka ako dahil parang deformed ang hitsura niya sa larawan. ni-restart ko ang phone ko at inulit pero ganoon pa rin. kaya tumabi ako sa kanya at mabilis na kumuha ng selfie. grabe ang galit niya sa akin! pinagsusuntok niya ako pero tinanggap ko ang lahat hanggang sa mawala ang galit niya. mga six months din bago ko nakita 'yung picture sa phone ko. inabot din kasi ng six months bago natanggal ang cast sa mga braso at binti ko. &#x200b; pagtingin ko sa picture na kinuha ko (kinuha ng girlfriend ko 'yung cellphone ko at itinago pero nakita ko rin naman sa closet niya noong makalabas ako sa ospital), naguluhan ako sa nakita ko. sa larawan, nakatingin ako sa camera at nakangiti. sa tabi ko, may isang matandang babae ang nakaupo. kulubot na ang kanyang mga mukha at kulay abo na ang mga buhok. suot-suot niya ang favorite t-shirt ng nobya ko. &#x200b; napailing na lang ako sa nakita ko. bilib na bilib pa naman ako sa camera ng iphone pero mukhang nagma-malfunction din pala ito. kaya ngayon, samsung na ang telepono ko. hindi ko na rin kinuhanan pa ng litrato ang girlfriend ko. &#x200b; rule #4. huwag magpapakita ng kabaitan sa ibang mga babae. ops! baka isipin niyo na selosa at mahigpit ang girlfriend ko. naku, diyan po kayo nagkakamali. sa katunayan, ayos lang sa kanya na makipagkaibigan ako sa mga babae. hindi siya nagagalit o nagtatampo. naalala ko nga noon, mayroon akong naging kaibigang babae sa trabaho, si carla. siyempre, tayong mga lalaki, natural na friendly tayo sa mga kababaihan. accomodating tayo at mahilig magbiro at mag-joke. madalas tuloy ay pinaghihinalaan tayo ng ating mga girlfriends. pero, iba ang girlfriend ko. ayos lang sa kanya ang ganoon. kahit nakikita niyang magkasama kami ni carla at nagtatawanan kapag bumibisita siya sa office, hindi siya nagagalit. nakakalungkot nga lang na hindi na natin kapiling si carla ngayon. natagpuan na lang siya isang umaga sa kuwarto niya, patay na. noong bumisita ako sa burol niya, nasabi sa akin ng kapatid niya na na-overdose daw sa gamot si carla. pagpasok daw nila sa kuwarto niya, nakita nila si carla na nakahiga sa kama, bumubula ang bibig. sa tabi niya, maraming nagkalat na gamot. puro tusok din ng karayom ang buong katawan niya. marahil daw, dahil sa depresyon o anumang mental illness, tinusok-tusok ni carla ang sarili niya ng karayom at pagkatapos ay uminom ng maraming gamot. ang nakapagtataka lamang daw, wala silang nakitang anumang karayom sa kuwarto ni carla. &#x200b; gaya nga ng sabi ko, hindi selosa ang girlfriend ko. marami akong mga naging kaibigang babae. nandyan si cherry na dating classmate ko noong college. marahil ay nakita mo siya sa balita. isang gabi kasi, habang papauwi galing trabaho, may tumulak daw sa kanya kaya nasagasaan siya ng isang bus. naging close ko rin si june at si barbie. kaso lang, maaga silang kinuha ni lord. bigla na lang silang na-comatose at hindi na nagising. over-fatigued daw sabi ng mga doktor. &#x200b; inaasar nga ako ng mga kaibigan ko ngayon na under daw ako ng girlfriend ko kaya hindi ako nakikipagkaibigan sa mga babae. pero ayos lang naman sa akin. mas masaya akong tawaging under kaysa naman magkaroon ng mga babaeng kaibigan pagkatapos... &#x200b; rule #5. kapag nagising ka sa madaling araw at nakita si girlfriend na naghahanap ng pagkain at mukhang gutom na gutom, magtago sa closet o kaya'y tumalon sa bintana. nakakatawa itong experience na ito. bakit ba ang mga babae, laging gutom? tapos, kapag pinakain mo masaya na kaagad sila? &#x200b; nagising ako isang beses mga alas-tres 'yata iyon. may narinig kasi akong mga kalampag kaya bumangon ako. wala rin kasi si girlfriend sa tabi ko. sa kusina ko siya nakita, hinahalughog ang ref namin. kaso, hindi pa kami nakakapag-grocery dahil wala pang sahod. &#x200b; tiningnan niya ako, nakakunot ang noo niya.

"An economist's (me) input on the ""Peso is not weak because the peso is weak) fiasco","tldr: sandro marcos is not wrong, but who gives a flying fuck about a technicality. the philippine peso, like other currencies, have weakened severely against the dollar. the us dollar is strengthening because of three reasons: 1. the us federal reserve (central bank) is raising their interest rates. meaning, us bonds will give better interest rates. so investors will buy dollars. 2. global uncertainty. the us dollar is a ""safe-haven currency."" meaning, if times are tough, people hoard dollars like people who hoarded alcohol and tissue during the pandemic. 3. our reliance on imports. imports aren't bad, but if your only solution to high prices is imports, you cripple your industry and subject yourself to fx risk and material risk from the exporting countries. also, you weaken your currency (low demand peso, high demand dollar) to prove the dollar is so fucking strong, here's a list of asian currencies and their respective depreciation against the dollar: 1. hkd/usd: -0.6% 2. sgd/usd: -6% 3. idr/usd: -7% 4. twd/usd: -13% 5. php/usd: -13% 6. krw/usd: -17% 7. jpy/usd: -22% if you compare the peso to other currencies, you get mixed results. so, this means the peso, relative to other currencies, is stable. while the peso, relative to the dollar, is weak. so, from a technical perspective, sandro marcos is correct. but as my tldr says, who gives a shit? i don't buy gas, shoes, cars, food, clothes, books, etc with fucking japanese yen or great british pounds. unless you soley import tea and scones from the east india trading company, you're going to need fucking dollars. almost everything in the global market is bought with us fucking dollars (thanks imperialism/capitalism). so, the effects of the weakening peso is felt by all filipinos and the techinicalities the marcos camp offers do nothing to help. there are a few things the ph can do to strengthen its currency: 1. sell dollars (this is why our international reserves are dipping. it's more of a short-term solution to temper volatility) 2. raise interest rates (which we are doing very slowly) 3. reduce import dependence (which we are not doing) 4. improve exports (which we are not since we are content exporting people) to sum up everything, sandro marcos is correct. but the effects of a weak usd/php exchange rate is felt by everyone, the technicality offers no comfort, and the ph's response to the sudden weakness is lackluster.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/y2l35w/an_economists_me_input_on_the_peso_is_not_weak/,13 10 2022
[DISCUSSION] Our HUGE population doesn't have to be a curse or weakness,"**the goal of this post is to start some nice good discussions. i didnt post this to preach my opinion** our population can actually be an asset if we can take advantage of its potential (i know...given the kind of government we have, that's a big **if**) currently, our population sits at 115 million it is projected to reach 116 million in 2024 or 2025. our population growth rate was actually decreasing steadily since the 1950's, and the rate only increased in 2020. that's almost 70yrs of continued decrease in population growth rate. note: decreasing growth rate from 1950-2020 does not mean decreasing in total population number, it means it's decreasing in ratio. decreased rate means our population was growing all those years, but it is growing at a very slow rate basically from 1950-2020 we were growing very slowly, but from 2020 up until today we're growing faster now, let's talk about numbers (and i'll keep it very simple) here are some of our population stats that are actually good: * the philippines have 115 million people, and 61% are in their ""prime years"" (age 15 to 64) * according to demographers, ages 15 to 64 are called ""prime years"" because that's the age when people are productive. according to them, age 15 is where more people either (a) pursue higher education (college/university), (b) get employed at a job, or (c) start a business. all three of those paths are crucial for a country's growth. and age 64 is when most people are physically incapable of doing a lot of work * the philippines having 61% in the prime years does not automatically mean all those people are in those 3 categories i listed on the point above, it just means 61% should be capable of doing those 3 * 61% isn't that good, but it's also not that bad...it's just okay. it's only bad because a lot of those in the 61% are not maximized to their potential (i will explain later) * on the other hand, 34.6% of our population are considered ""children"" (age 0-14). this is actually good for the future of this country, because these children will be our ""work force"" in the future. there's a misconception that fewer births are good because there are fewer mouths to feed, which means less expenses. that is **not** true. fewer children means that there will be less people who will grow up to become part of the ""prime years"" in the future. and as we established in the points above, it's bad if the country has few people in the ""prime years"" category * 34.6% of our population as children is good, the only issue here is if we can make sure these children actually grow up with a secure future (again, big **if** with this kind of government) * to prove that this is actually a good thing, just look at japan. today, they have a good ""prime year"" number (64%), which is good right now. but their government is actually worried for the future of their country, because they only have 13% in the children category. and that's seriously bad, because only few people will grow up to be productive. if they can't solve it within the next 10yrs, their economy is screwed. in the philippines, we dont have this problem * 80% of filipinos can understand basic english. that's a huge number for a non-western country. it's sad that we failed to capitalize this incredible asset. although this does not mean that all those 80% are proficient or good. the 80% are just people who understand basic english. still, that's a big number now, here's some bad statistics. with how poorly run this country is, there are so many, but i'll just focus on a few. maybe we can talk about the others on another post, but for now i'll focus on these. anyway... * 64% of our population is dependent, and that's a lot. this means the philippines is relying only on the 36% to carry this entire nation on their backs. in raw numbers, this means 41million filipinos are expected to carry and feed 115million people. that's not good * only 31% of filipinos above 25yrs old are highschool graduates * almost 1/5 of our entire population is located in these areas: metro manila, metro davao, metro cebu, and the zamboanga urban area. imagine that, 1/5 of our population are all jam-packed and crowded in just 4 urban areas what can we draw from these data? 1) we have a lot of people in our ""prime years"" category, or those who are capable of either being employed, starting a business, or enrolling in a higher education. it's a great advantage. 2) however this advantage has become a disadvantage. a lot of filipinos who are in the ""prime years"" are not employed or educated. heck 80% of our adults did not even finish highschool 3) more than half of filipinos are dependent on someone else's income 4) i know people will say more people = more traffic, but that's not automatically true. tokyo is crowded but the transport system is so good that it doesnt even matter 5) in terms of population congestion, we have a lot of people but crowding should not be a problem if done with proper planning. we're all just jam-packed in a few cities while the other areas remain under-developed solutions we should consider: - if you look at the data (both the good and bad), it looks like we need to open more jobs available to people who can be considered as **skilled workers**. it's good that we tell our youth to pursue being a professional (lawyer, engineer, doctor, accountant, etc). but we should also promote the importance of skilled workers in our economy - **skilled workers** are those who work on jobs that require training and certification, but not necessarily a college degree or diploma. examples of skilled workers are construction workers, guards, drivers, call center agents, plumbers, factory workers, etc etc - in other countries, skilled workers are very respected and called the ""backbone of the workforce"" but here in the philippines they're considered as just lowly ""uneducated employees"". in other countries they are considered as an important cornerstone of the economy, i hope we can do that same here - we talked about how a lot of filipinos in the ""prime years"" are not productive, but the solution to this is to promote jobs available to skilled workers. stop looking at skilled workers as uneducated or not important. again in other countries, they are respected and they are seen as people who are crucial to the economy - we should stop the mindset that if you're not a college graduate, you should be a businessman instead. you can also be a skilled worker. - of course, you need to pay them well. you also need to lower the requirements. we dont need a diploma for these jobs, and that's actually the point. we already have a hard time producing higschool graduates, if we cant also produce skilled workers then things will just get worse - the government should start programs that will encourage adults to have **more children**. i know this sub doesnt like that statement, but hear me out. if the government can assure us that children will have a bright future in this country, i dont know why having more children is a bad thing - increase our salaries, give us benefits, and improve public services. if that happens it's almost a guarantee that our children will take care of this country in the future - create more opportunities outside metro manila, cebu, davao, and zamboanga area. so much of our population is jam-packed in just these 4 areas. make jobs available outside these areas. - 80% of our population speaks english and yet we havent thought of ways to use it for our advantage. we always teach students that english is the key to ""globalization"", but it's a shame that a lot of our neighbors who are very bad at english (like s.korea and japan) are more globalized than us. **tldr:** having a big population is not bad, it's only bad if all those people are not productive. a population that's both big and productive is good sources i used for the numbers and raw data: [source 1](https://countrymeters.info/en/philippines), [source 2](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1067059/population-philippines-historical/), [source 3](https://mb.com.ph/2023/8/16/47-of-filipinos-competent-in-english-language-sws), [source 4](https://www.pbed.ph/blogs/47/pbed/state%20of%20philippine%20education%20report%202023)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/18dexdn/discussion_our_huge_population_doesnt_have_to_be/,8 12 2023

"" ""ang boring mo kasi sis."" ""puro aral lang nga ginagawa mo."" okay lang naman kung nagtatanong sila ng sincere pero iba talaga yung tono ng pagkakasabi. nakakainis talaga dahil palagi na lang nangyayari 'to. and they proceeded bragging what kind of drinks have they tried and that they have a high alcohol tolerance. like duh, that's what you're proud of? i can't even have any deep conversation with them because all they talk about are pop culture and life of celebrities.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/kjzpho/bakit_weak_ang_tingin_sa_mga_taong_di_umiinom/,25 12 2020

I think Manny Pacquiao is so unpopular because of weak campaign strategy,"in my facebook i decided to share everything positive about other candidates than leni, hoping some soft bbms will go and hop over to isko, paq and ka leody. sorry, ping, i don't like you now. then when i checked manny's campaign pages and his followers i feel sad. - it's generic videos and pictures of manny's motorcade and rallies - a lot or martial law awareness posts - this is really a good and our allies, but then it doesn't help grow manny himself. - there's no tagline or catchy phrase i can pick up unlike ""unity"" of the unithieves, kulay rosas ang bukas and #xispink - i can't even figure out paquiao colors or symbol - there's a popular video of paquiao making a speech and the audience is touched, but it's in his native language and without english/tagalog subtitles. - i can't see any celebrity endorsements, if there is one, it's unpopular - if i missed some things after scrolling a few minutes, then i guess they aren't visible, right? overall in textbook formula of winning candidates, pacquiao should have been popular. a year ago we are speculating that it's going to be sara vs paq vs bbm. pacquiao has the components of 1) poverty to success 2) not part of a dynasty 3) a great campaign material of perseverance as an athlete and being the pride of the nation 4) he's rich because of boxing, not because of politics, just like how marcos got rich due to his hidden gold bars (/s) but i feel his campaign team, or whoever is backing him up and pushing him to run, has a really weak strategy over the years. pacquiao's success story in life should have been at least villar-levels back in the 2009 elections. they probably got complacent and thought manny's name and success in senatorial elections are enough to gain momentum. while one can say his homophobic remarks brought him down, it's really not, since he still won the elections after that. i'd say besides complacency of his camp, his overall lack of charisma in politics, it also didn't help he was a soft duterte supporter turned critic. with his criticism, manny alienated duterte's cult of loud, online, bullies. people forgot his inspirational rags to riches story and the spectacle of his boxing, perfect action star narrative that would have resonated with a lot of people. i'm not saying i want him to be president, like a lot of here, i just want him to remain as a philanthropist. however, i'm just sharing my thoughts on how ineffective his campaign had been and why people flocked to other options.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/tzf42i/i_think_manny_pacquiao_is_so_unpopular_because_of/,8 04 2022

Job interview experience,"so today i messed up my interview big time, this is my 3rd face to face interview experience after being idle for 2 years after graduation because of my stuttering disorder. i had develop this disability during my college days, i don't know how and when it started but i just find myself having difficulty reciting and presenting in the classroom that's why after graduation i didn't find work immediately because i was afraid to be interviewed so i just gave the excuse of reviewing for board exam and covid to my parents so that they won't pressure me to work. no one knows in my family of this situation, only my college teachers and classmates who knows it. i thought i can cure it on my own, and that time can cure it, i did some tutoring to improve my stutter, i practiced presenting in front of the mirror, and i forced myself to socialize more but i found out today that i'm still not over this problem. my last two interviews was kinda informal, it's just like speaking with a friend and the atmosphere was noisy but i did okay speaking in front of many people and talking to the interviewer but today's interview was very formal, the atmosphere was so solemn, it was a closed door interview with the head dept and hr. when they dropped the first question, suddenly i can't speak, i had difficulty swallowing and i can't just utter a word, i froze and i saw how the interviewers eye each other, i knew i just messed up. i even pressed my throat forcing a cough and drinks water, and with a very shaky voice i told them about my disorder, and asked them respectfully to repeat the question, despite being mad at myself and feeling ashamed, i forced myself to continue answering it with my stuttering voice and because of it i had difficulty saying what i practiced and speaking what's on my mind and just answered very shortly. after 15 mins or so, my voice kept improving and i gained a tiny bit of confidence and i also became a bit talkative but looking at the interviewers current attitude, i knew i cannot redeem myself anymore. compared to the first applicant, my interview was very short. i was teary eyed leaving the office and when i arrived at the waiting area, some workers at the company and the first applicant was there and they notice me wiping my nose, they jokingly asked me if i cried so i composed myself and i said i was just having a runny nose because of the rain earlier but then the hr came, and i was so shocked when she just asked me why i am so tense at the interview in front of these people, she said she didn't asked me more cause i was very nervous etc. i don't mind being point out with my mistakes but i definitely don't want other people knowing what happen at the interview, i was expecting the hr to talk to me privately about the results and give me feedback with my performance just like my last interview but to say it in public and given my situation, i was very embarrassed so i just cried there, in front of those people. i don't want to attend job interviews anymore, and i just want to go home to my parents. my mind was full of negative thoughts, i am very depressed but then i realized my brother is waiting for me in front of the company, he was very tired after working overnight but he still accompany me because i just move in this place. he is very hungry and sleepy and because it's almost 4 pm, he can't go to work tonight. i was so guilty, and i am so mad at myself. i was the only one in my family who graduated in college, they are expecting so much from me but then it was so sad i am a failure. i don't have anyone to talk to and i am just crying silently here in my bed so i just want to share my situation here in reddit so that i can at least let out some bottled up feelings. i have a final interview this week with the same company who interviewed me first and also just got another call for a new one next week. i hope i can recover from this and do well for the next interviews.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/v2gpkp/job_interview_experience/,1 06 2022
My wife’s COVID19 story,"hello, just want to share this story to all of you. my wife by the way has recovered already and it’s been a month now. thankfully she only had mild symptoms when she got covid. but i’m going to share how she got the virus so that other people can be informed and can prevent themselves from being infected. march 30, we had a swab test at our house but my bro in law included his staff on that day. staff needed a swab test cert to go to a province. unfortunately, the staff arrived early and she was given a seat at the garage. she was already there about 5 minutes before the person who will do the swab arrived. the garage was a typical open air. she also did not talk, did not cough nor even sneeze. but she put down her mask every once in a while because she wiped her face with a small towel. i think she did this around 2-3 times. she also had runny nose on that day. come swab time, the first 2 person had their blood test taken and not nasal swab. after those 2, it was my wife’s turn and she was scheduled to be swabbed. so she put down her mask only for a few seconds. after the swab, the mask went up to cover her nose and mouth. she was also seated around 2 meters from the staff, and it was not directly adjacent. after my wife, my bro in law got swabbed and then the staff. later that day, we got the news that the staff was positive for covid. my wife’s symptoms appeared after 3 days from that interaction. prior to those days, we rarely go out and she had 2 masks on every time and we spray alcohol for every foreign object that we touched. aside from my wife, a yaya also got infected but her symptoms appeared on the 5th day. this nanny went out to the garage without a mask but for less than 10 seconds. she gave the mobile phone to my wife’s sister bec someone was calling. i think she was about 1-2 meters away from the staff as well. this nanny doesn’t go out for day offs bec she’s afraid and she does not even go to the gate to receive packages or talk to other people. so we’re pretty sure that she got the virus from that staff. lessons that i learned from this: - the virus is airborne and 1 meter is not enough. actually, i searched who and it mentioned that covid19 can last upto 3 hours in the air. - before, we thought that an infected person needs to cough, sneeze or talk for their virus to spread. but in this case, i think the virus spread when she flipped her towel. - there were about 7 people on that garage and only 2 were infected bec the other 5 had their masks on. - it only takes a few seconds for you to get the virus especially if you don’t have a mask. i heard from someone that you need minutes to be infected. hope this helps :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/nc0qpu/my_wifes_covid19_story/,14 05 2021

dumating ang ecq at nagsaraduhan na ang mga clinic around last week of march at wala na akong mapuntahang clinic. sarado na din ung lagi naming pinagcoconsultahan. so nakahanap kami ibang clinic dun ko siya dinala, nilakad namin for 30 mins dalawa ni nala para ma skin scrape siya, negative ulit ang findings.. tinuklap hotspot niya at inapplyan ng cream. binigyan kame gamot na nag cost around 2k+ pero sabi ko ok lang para naman to kay nala. 1 week after, walang nangyari, lumala pa. &#x200b;

My proposal is penalized individuals na lumabas na meron symptoms as a priority vs unvaccinated,"nanoticed ko na our government is now starting to punish individuals who are unvaccinated pero hindi ba ang unvaccinated ang dehado? they have the biggest risk right now if they go out, giving them more chances to get severe case of covid. pero tayong vaccinated, less chances of severe type of covid. not zero chance of covid. and everyone is still a potential carrier of the disease. pero i can see a lot of people working right now sa labas na may sipon at ubo. eto ung nakakaspread ng sakit pero no one is telling them sa bahay po muna kayo magquarantine kasi baka covid yan at nakakahawa. hindi ba mas dapat ipriority ito vs unvaccinated. or do a proper marketing sa pinas, if may sipon or ubo or trankaso, ok lang na di muna pumasok or wag ka na lumabas muna. ang sipon at ubo at pedeng makahawa ng iba, blah blah. alam ko turo ng mga magulang or prof natin dati, ubo sipon lang yan, kung sila nga mamatay na kayod parin para lang mabuhay or pumasok sa school etc. pero it's not the mentality na you are weak for not working or going to school but because you can be a carrier that can infect more people. edit: best explanation why we are encouraging vaccination to the unvax: https://www.reddit.com/r/philippines/comments/s3lvv3/my_proposal_is_penalized_individuals_na_lumabas/hslons9/ why providing sick leave is important and the current situation sa country natin why di mabigyan basta basta: https://www.reddit.com/r/philippines/comments/s3lvv3/my_proposal_is_penalized_individuals_na_lumabas/hsloul0/ also i want to clarify that i didn't post this to discourage people from getting vaccinated. get vaccinated if hindi ka pa vaccinated. this will prevent you from getting too sick or die from covid. magastos magkasakit. but the increase in numbers in covid right now isn't caused by the unvaccinated people but people who go out with symptoms (whether vaccinated or not vaccinated sila). we started to become too lenient and confident na basta bakunado ok na. it takes everyone to be considerate to not go out or not go to work physically if you are sick or has symptoms to prevent possible transmission of any type of viruses (whether if it's the regular flu or covid). yun ang gusto ko ipoint out dito.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/s3lvv3/my_proposal_is_penalized_individuals_na_lumabas/,14 01 2022

Ever wonder why random cellphone # miss call you?

(kasi i learned may iba nang volunteers na pumunta doon dati) - saan saan ka na nakapunta? (rallies) emphasis on ""idol"" when speaking about leni. they are in a mindset i'm doing this because i idolize a person. tapos curious sila aa merch ko sabi ko binili ko walang bayad ginagawa ko kampanya lang. sabi ko sa pasay lang ako umattend (so it's clear to them i'm not a rally hopper). i also said wala akong partida or grupo, sarili ko lang. i managed to steer the conversation to sumilao farmers. i told them i used to be apathetic/walang pake kung sinong pangulo dati (partly true, i was undecided until march just not bbm), tapos nagbago isip ko kasi sa story ng farmers. **not so good experience** one driver ask my age, if i'm married, and if i have a manliligaw then when he learned i'm single he's like ""sabi na nga"". i don't entirely consider this negative in a sense ganito talaga matatanda that they couldn't comprehend why some women marry late, pero i'm 80% sure they wouldn't ask the same question to a man. tapos yung mga nag ubos ng merch ko, paglayo nila nang-aasar ng ""wala kaming paki sa pangulo mo"" nq parinig saka i can overhear na ""bayad na 300 pesos umattend sa rally ni leni,"" at ""next week pag natalo kakabahan lahat yan."" when i walked near them they were suddenly silent. puro sila parinig pag malayo ako but they couldn't say it to my face. i chose not to engage na since i'm a lone woman saka it's like their baiting me with pang-aasar. **all in all** may iilang nakinig, kahit sexist pakikitungo sa akin, at least narinig nila yung kwento ng sumilao farmers. abonado merch, abonado oras, no regrets. hindi to for leni, para sa prinsipyo.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/uezuju/nag_jogging_ako_at_namigay_ng_lenikiko_merch_sa/,30 04 2022

Animal Shelters and Online 'Limos',"naglipana na ang mga iba't ibang animal shelters online, and i think it's a good thing since it's a worthy cause. they post pictures of their beloved rescues, may it be dogs or cats. some even make memes out of them, but sometimes i can't help but notice that some are using them to their advantage. magpopost sila ng picture ng rescue nila na mukhang nakakakaawa tas magcacaption na ""mag-donate na kayo, ubos na yung cat food ko - rescue."" pwede rin yung picture kung saan kita halos lahat na rescues na pinapakain tas ang caption ""ito na ang huling araw na may pagkain sila, baka pwede kayo magdonate para makabili at makakain sila bukas."" or simply, ""wala nang pagkain ang mga rescues namin, pwede kayo magdonate ng ₱200 para sa isang can ng cat food or pwede niyo rin ipadala sa aming bahay (insert address)."" para bagang responsibilidad ng kanilang followers or donators na buhayin yung mga rescues nila. i get it, mahal magpakain at bumuhay ng mga rescues, pero sana magrescue lang sila hangga't sa makakaya ng kanilang bulsa. paano na laamang kung bumaba ang engagements at donations nila to the point na hindi na sustainable yung pagpapatakbo ng shelter? hindi rin imposible na magsara yung shelter at yung mga rescues nila ay mapunta lang sa city pound to be killed. buti man lang kung maraming nagaadopt eh kakaunti na nga lang tas dadagdagan pa nila yung mga rescues para makapaglimos na naman sila ulit sa mga followers nila. hindi ba animal cruelty rin yung paggamit sa kanila para magkaroon ng awa 'effect' sa mga followers nila and minsan 'lowkey' guilt-tripping para magdonate sa mga rescues nila? i'm not saying na bawal na mag-solicit ng donations yung mga shelters kaso yung iba hindi na rin sumasapat yung donations bukod doon sa nilalabas na pera ng mga rescuers. yung ibang shelters nga personal account nila ang ginagamit para sa mga donations kaya mahirap din magkaroon ng transparency and accountability kasi sa bank secrecy laws ng ating bansa, in contrast, sa mga ngo (e.g. paws) or foundations na may sariling bank account nila. hindi ko naman sinasabi na lahat sila ay ill-intentioned but i think every donator intends to know if their donations are really going to the rescues and hindi sila naneneglect because it's going to rescuers instead. what's your take on this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/yo4exw/animal_shelters_and_online_limos/,6 11 2022

Story time: Uninformed News Edition,"a friend showed me a tiktok video of a supposed influencer sharing his thoughts on covid. the video (with embedded texts) went like this: ""storytime: covid 19 edition and then dinala sa hospital, dead on arrival. then sabi nung doctor sa mga kamag anak. kung papayag yung family na ang ilagay sa death cert nung namatay ay covid instead of heart attack 😱😱. so yun lang, idk what to do with that information kaya skl."" let me answer you, what you should do with that information is ask someone who is knowledgeable on the topic or at least someone who knows more than you do, cause you definitely don't know a lot. what you should not do though is post a video putting the hospital and medical professionals in a malicious light. for those of you who wants to be educated on the topic: anyone who is symptomatic, we can't mix with those who do not have the symptoms. ubo, sipon, lagnat, hirap sa paghinga, pananakit ng kasukasuan, pagsusuka, pagtatae or pagkawala ng pang-amoy at panlasa. you might be wondering, eh ang daming sakit with the same symptoms. yes, kaya nga po puno ang emergency rooms and covid floors. unless proven na negative ka sa covid (with rt-pcr), it is prudent that we don't place you with those without the symptoms. hospital protocols also dictates that anyone who arrives dead will be tagged as covid suspect (relating to the tiktok vid, paano nasabing heart attack? may ckmb ka? may trop i ka? may ecg ka ba???). covid also complicates underlying conditions like heart, brain problems which might have led to the demise of the patient. did the patient die of a heart problem? possible. did the patient die of covid? possible. hindi sya exclusive, and unless we do post-mortem swab, we will not know. the government ideally should fund more research centers and laboratories, to make testing more available kahit sa maralita. sayang yung mga inutang. hindi lahat ng tao afford ang 2-5k na rt-pcr swab na may 7 days validity lang. pag may rt-pcr ka na timely ang collection, you need not be tagged as suspect and can be treated sa covid negative area, therefore decongesting the covid suspect area, therefore freeing some resources that can be used for those in critical conditions. i am all for freedom of expression, but i also believe in responsible posting. supposed ~influencers~ should help us eradicate misinformation, use their platform for greater good. you also address your audience well. isang taon na tayong lockdown, ang dami nang dinagdag na letra sa cq. baka naman po? if you have any questions, if in any way i can explain things in simpler terms. i also urge people in the medical field to answer people the simplest way possible, to be ""patola"" na. our job extends way outside the corners of the hospital. di na lang covid ang kalaban, bad governance, ignorance and misinformation too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/mgihgq/story_time_uninformed_news_edition/,30 03 2021

Basketball Country gone wrong,"may nababasa akong mga nagagalit kase bakit basketball ang prioty sports sa pinas. lagi na lang daw basketball, paano naman ung ibang sports. medyo magulo kse ung tanong na yun, walang direktang pinatatamaan. tutal maraming mainit ang mata ngayon sa gilas. totoong nakakafrustrate ang fiba run ng gilas for the last couple of world cups. dito kse nila inuugnay yung statement about sa priority ng bansa sa sports. naisip ko bigla kung sino ba nagfufund sa gilas? under ang management ng gilas sa sbp or samahang basketbol ng pilipinas. pero ang mvp (at nasa transistion na sya sa smc) ang main sponsor ng programa. correct me if i'm wrong. malaking improvement ang sponsorship para makapag generate ng success ang isang sports team. halimbawa, ang mga schools sa uaap at ncaa na madalas nagkakampeon ay atleast may major sponsor galing sa malaking kumpanya. so ibig sabihin, sa tanong na bakit priority ang basketball sa pilipinas. ---- nagkataon lang na ang basketball ang napiling sponsoran ng malaking kumpanya. advertisement pa rin at the end of the day at pera nila yun. same goes sa volleyball natin na umaangat na rin. pwede ba nating sisihin yang malalaking kumpanya na sponsoran ang isang event/sports team/ atbp. kung doon sila makakabenefit sa pag advertise ng produkto nila. sa pangkalahatan, ang gobyerno pa rin ang dapat na naglalaan ng disenteng budget sa lahat ng sports sa bansa, pero hindi nga yun ung nangyayare, maraming atleta ang hindi naabot ang peak ng kanilang abilidad dahil sa kakulangan ng pondo. pasalamat na rin tayo sa mga sponsorship na nakukuha ng ilan sa kanila. &#x200b; &#x200b; &#x200b; &#x200b;",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/164zihc/basketball_country_gone_wrong/,30 08 2023

'ano naman to.' then dm sa akin 'anong pinagsasasabi mo? pinapahiya mo magulang mo. di ka nahihiya?' nagdilim na lang paningin ko. every time na binabara nila ako sa posts ko about bbm or sara, technically, pinapahiya nila ako. di ba sila nahihiya? sobrang daming naunpack after that. sa totoo lang, di naman sila ganyan kadouchebags. naging ganyan lang after the elections. parang every time na kinicriticise mo ang mga marcos, offended na offended sila. wala akong tinatawag na bobo or tanga. i accepted na yun binoto nila. never ko sila ininsulto, pero kinacall out ko ang gobyerno.

Some jeepney drivers don’t deserve their license.,"meron talagang mga jeepney drivers na mae-encounter ka na mapapaisip ka nalang, “paano kaya nakakuha ng lisensya to?”. sunod-sunod na traffic violations, mainit ang ulo na idadamay pa yung mga inosenteng pasahero, di nagbibigay ng sukli, etc. i don’t want this post na maging anti-poor. i know all of them just want to make a living and provide for their families but that doesn’t mean naman na they can just be reckless sa road, right? when you’re driving, especially a public vehicle, hindi lang life mo ang at risk, mga pasahero mo rin. last friday i encountered this extremely rude jeepney driver along alabang-zapote road. just to be clear hindi ako yung sinungitan nya but other pasahero pero i feel really bad for them because isipin mo sobrang init na ng panahon and pagod ka from work or school tapos ganyan pa ugali ng jeepney driver na masasakyan mo. like this one guy said “sa tabi lang po” and i’m guessing he assumed that the driver didn’t hear what he said so the pasahero said “para po” ng 2 times pa ulit. the driver got mad and shouted “sa susunod nga na nagmamadali kayo bumili kayo ng sarili nyong sasakyan ha”. nasa tabi ng driver ako nakaupo nun so rinig na rinig ko talaga and i was shookt. then meron pa na may nakasabay sya sa kabilang lane na friend nyang jeepney driver din and nag kwentuhan sila habang nag d-drive ng sobrang bagal it was causing traffic na sa likod, one driver behind him talagang nag b-beep na sa kanila and this caused him to explode again and shouted “putang ina mo kanina ka pa busina nang busina ha”. tapos one person said “para po” pero this time di talaga narinig ng driver kaya napahinto sya sa may bandang intersection and he got pissed again and shouted about how filipinos are pasaway daw and stuff na bakit ngayon lang daw bababa. gosh, the amount of times i rolled my eyes during the byahe talaga. then the driver stopped suddenly and said sa lahat ng pasahero “wala bang bababa dyan?” then no one responded but i noticed this one student slightly leaning forward to get a clear view of the road ahead, obvious naman na bababa sya malapit na. the driver ignored this and exclaimed “wala na bababa dyan ng alanganin ha” sabay harurot ng sobrang bilis, completely ignoring the poor student saying “para po” and di tumigil hanggang di nakarating sa next stop light. after that thing talaga i realized di ko na kaya tagalan yung driver na yun, bumababa nalang ako nung medyo malapit na sa destination ko. when i looked back pa nga i saw na he parked his jeepney na sa side ng road and got off, habang meron pang pasahero sa loob. he just decided that’s the end of his byahe and wala na magagawa yung ibang pasahero but bumaba nalang kahit malayo pa ang destination nila. buong byahe rin bigla bigla syang sumisingit sa ibang lane, nag overflow, di nag si-signal, etc. i was scared for my life. sorry for the long rant. this really just pissed me off. there’s so many things i wish i’ve done like take a picture of his plate number and file a report to ltfrb pero di ko rin nagawa because i was also slightly bothered by the thought na baka magalit sya sa akin if i even dare take a picture of his jeepney.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/17deymr/some_jeepney_drivers_dont_deserve_their_license/,21 10 2023

Halloween Inequality,"like most other subdivisions in metro manila, ours is an island of middle class comfort and tranquility amidst a sea of poverty. it's your typical village in the south na mas madami ang kotse kesa sa tao, at tuwing naglalakad ako sa labas, puro mga maid, driver at sekyu lang ang nakikita ko, with the exception of the usual senior citizen power-walking group. mas madami din ang matatanda (retired) vs mga households na may pamilya at mga anak. the halloween party was situated in the village clubhouse, which is within the grounds of the subdivision park. the park and the subdivision is separated from the village's main avenue by a chain-link fence, so you can see what's going on from the outside. sa loob, may clown, may magician, may catering, may mga pa-cocktail sa mga parents at matatanda. and on the outside, beyond the wire, may mga bata mula sa mga neighboring depressed areas na naghihintay at nakikinuod lang sa mga tao sa loob. this is where it got a little bit depressing. &#x200b; nung time na para mag ikot ikot sa mga bahay, we all filed into one line palabas ng clubhouse and binuksan yung mga gate para makaikot na kami sa bahay bahay - we were a lot, siguro mga 100 plus, pero mas madami ang mga matatanda like yayas and parents kesa sa mga bata. when we turned around the corner, dun namin nakita na ang daming mga bata kasama ng mga magulang nila na kanina pa daw nag iintay para makakahingi ng candy. sila yung mga galing depressed areas. the event started at 5 pm, and andun pa daw sila mga 3 pm palang. meron pa akong mga side comments na naririnig from fellow neighbors na wag daw papasukin yung mga badjao at mga free-loader. sabi nung isang guard dun sa pamilya na gusto pumasok sa village ""jan lang muna kayo. pwede na kayo bumisita sa bahay pagka may natira"" when we got back home after the dinner and the show, my stepsons got 3 full baskets of candies, chocolates and biscuits. tapos hindi magkasya so kelangan ko pa tumakbo sa bahay para kumuha ng ecobag. looking back, hindi din naman nila kayang ubusin lahat yan, and hindi ko din naman ipapaubos sa kanila yan because it's unhealthy. i'm not one to meddle with the rules and regulations, after all, it's a private event, pero ang awkward lang na habang naglalakad kami, naririnig namin , and ng mga kids ng homeowners yung mga galing sa laylayan na nakikihingi maski isang piraso lang. pakiramdam ko hindi lang ako ang nakaramdam ng awkwardness, but like myself, the others chose to remain silent and just enjoyed the entire thing. our household prepared 98 lootbags filled with tootsie rolls, timtams, kitkats, nerds, warheads and others. meron pa kaming 25 na natira, so which means the event was only roughly at 75% attendance. balak ko sana pumunta dun sa depressed area na malapit samin and ipamigay nalang on oct 31. &#x200b; if i were on the other side of the fence, i'd rather not know what they're doing rather than seeing everything, and yet, hanggang tingin lang ako. perhaps, in the future, mas okay na siguro kung gawin nalang nilang concreto yung bakod kesa wire. &#x200b;",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/17isokv/halloween_inequality/,29 10 2023
Asking for go to restroom,ask lang sa nakakaalam especially sa mga teacher may guidelines po ba kayo from deped regarding if nag paalam yung student niyo na gagamit ng restroom? yung kapatid kasi ng partner ko tumawag sa kadahilanan na hindi siya pinayagan mag cr kasi yun daw yung rules and regulations ng school once na nag umpisa na yung class bawal na daw umihi eh tatlong beses na daw siya nag paalam kasi nga ihing-ihi na siya pero hindi pa din siya pinapayagan kaya ang ginawa niya is umuwi na lang since masama yung pakiramdam niya and may uti din siya. mas lalo daw kasi sumama ng pakiramdam niya yung pinigilan niya ihi niya concern ko lang: health kasi ang nakasalalay sa mga student and affected din ang emotion ng tao kapag may nararamdaman tayo so hindi din makakafocus sa lesson plan ni teacher. and magkakasakit ang student if ganun nga gagawin nila.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/161cl72/asking_for_go_to_restroom/,25 08 2023

Teachers in PH who are Marcos Apologists are the worst.,"ako ay isa sa iilang natatanging kakampink sa aming department at majority ng mga guro dito na nasaksihan ko sa pampanga ay bbm supporters. hindi na ako magsasabi kung saang school. yung tipong mga former students nila nawawalan na ng respeto sa kanila upon discovering na marcos apologist sila pero hindi talaga sila natinag. kapag naman kausap namin regarding sa mga dahilan nila bakit hindi si leni, iilan lang ang mga ito sa sagot nila: 1. lutang daw siya (kasi tambay sila sa tiktok) 2. sinasakal daw siya ng mga oligarchs (hindi namin alam sino yung mga animal na oligarkong yan) 3. maayos daw buhay noong panahon ni marcos ayon sa lola nila. (seryoso, ito yung pinaka-napipikon akong makinig, kung buhay mama ko, pinalo na niya sila ng tukod niya.) 4. lastly, basta daw bbm wala daw kaming paki. (mataas pride nila) sa kauna-unahang pagkakataon, pakiramdam ko parang bumaba ang tingin ko sa kalidad nila. siguro may mastery of the subject sila sa itinuturo nila pero ang dali pa rin nilang maniwala sa misinformation at ang malala sila pa ang peddler nito. ang masaklap, gusto nilang turuan ang mga bata na mag-aral ng mabuti pero yung sinusuportahan nila ni walang diploma or credentials. nakakahiya, pakiramdam ko tuloy dawit ako sa mga kagagawan nila.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/umj7s1/teachers_in_ph_who_are_marcos_apologists_are_the/,10 05 2022

We all have that relative who refused to go to family gatherings. I'm slowly becoming one too.,"so i have this tito sa fatherside na hindi pumupunta sa mga gathering. when i was younger, i thought it was weird kaso close naman kami ni tito. some of my cousins also like him because they think he's cool. kaso wala, di mo talaga siya mapilit kahit sa mga noche buena man lang. nitong tumanda-tanda na ako ay saka ko lang naintindihan kung bakit. uso kasi ang yabangan sa pamilya ko. i recently found out about how my uncle felt kagabi lang. nagkaroon kasi ng father's day celebration sa kanila. um-attend daw siya saglit. then, he talked to me via messenger to ask where i was. sabi ko lang, nasa manila ako kaya di na ako makakabalik. then, i asked him kung bakit bigla yata siya um-attend. sabi niya, he's bored lang daw dahil nga sa tagal ng lockdown. even if he hates my family, he still likes social interaction to unwind. so iyon nga. dumating na kami sa topic kung bakit ayaw niyang dumadalo: he was harshly criticized before. sa kanilang magkakapatid kasi, siya lang ang di nakapag-college. bumagsak daw sa ncaa yata? basta yung requirement daw noon para makapag-college ka. he was shamed because of that, at sobra niyang dinala iyon hanggang sa tumanda na siya. funny dahil siya ang pinakamayaman sa kanilang magkakapatid. nakapag-australia kasi siya noon dahil sa welder siya, at nakapag-ipon siya. now, he owns a hardware/construction materials shop, at milyon-milyon ang kinikita niya. sabi pa niya sakin, natatawa na lang siya kapag tinatakbuhan siya ng mga kapatid na nagigipit. naalala kasi niya kung paano siya maliitin dahil hindi siya nakapag-college. after our talk, sa totoo lang, unti-unti ko na ring napag-iisip-isip na nagiging katulad na niya ako. it all started noong 2019. hindi ako dumalo sa mga gathering (except pasko/new year) the whole year. lagi kong katuwiran, busy ako sa work. pero kapag naman di ako nakakasama, i don't feel any regret. if anything, parang natutuwa pa nga akong di ko sila nakakasama. ang pressure naman sakin kasi is yung sa itsura ko. i used to have a misaligned jaw, which got fixed through a brace and surgery. dahil doon, nag-iba ang shape ng mukha ko. i have this uncle who makes fun of my face a lot, at noong natama na, di pa rin tumitigil. mamanahin daw ng anak ko yung misalignment ng panga ko. tapos, i got body shamed a lot din dahil tumaba ako bigla, and i recently found out na may hypothyroidism pala ako na naging dahilan kung bakit kahit di ako malakas kumain. naging laughingstock ako sa pamilya ko over something na wala naman akong kontrol, and i cannot even talk back dahil magmumukha akong bastos. i think itong ugali na ito ng mga kamag-anak nating ayaw nang magpakita ay nag-ugat doon sa pakiramdam na pinagtutulung-tulungan ka ng lahat. yung parang wala kang kakampi? it makes us feel pathetic and unwanted, and surely, nobody wants to be in that position, di ba? and we should be allowed to talk away from situations that hurt us.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/o4shud/we_all_have_that_relative_who_refused_to_go_to/,21 06 2021

a day in the life of a 88m supporter,"may kausap ako kahapon 88m supporter tungkol sa kwento ng buhay. nagki kwento cia sakin ng mga nangyayare sa bansa ngayon. hindi ako sumasagot. nakikinig lang ako. naka open ang facebook niya. kwento kwento lang siya tungkol sa kung ano ang nasa balita at buhay ng mga pinoy ngayon. ramdam ko gusto niyang maging masaya ung kwentuhan namin, parang may sense of pride ba. parang may feeling of victory or happy moments kasi para sa kanya nanalo nga. nakatutok siya sa comment section at iba’t ibang facebook groups, daig pa niya nanonood ng boxing sa gigil at excitement. pero sa tingin ko, alam naman niya na hindi 88m ang binoto ko. nakikinig lang ako. okay naman daw. kesa kay leni na lugaw. nakikinig lang ako. hanggang sa maya maya lumabas na ang totoo. ung kwento ng taas ng pamasahe, piso laban sa dolyar, presyo sa palengke, ang gastos dumoble pero ang sahod wala ng kwenta. nung una, umiikot sa ulo ko ung galit kasi hindi sila nakinig. nung bumoto ako kayo pinaglaban ko, pero kalaban pala ang tingin niyo sakin. pero kalaunan, awa na ung nararamdaman ko pag naririnig ko sila. nalagay sila sa isang sitwasyon na wala ng atrasan kasi andyan na. at gusto man nilang tumiwalag, wala na silang magawa kasi lutong luto na ang utak nila na wala ng ibang dapat mamuno sa bansa kundi ang manok nila at anoman ang kahihinatnan ng bansa sa kanila ay ayos lang, tatanggapin, pag titiisan kasi may diyos naman daw. na npa ka kasi kumokontra ka. isa kang terorista na walang ibang plano kundi sirain ang bansa. dilawan ka. na ang parang goal ay patumbahin ang mga kokontra. siraan kung kinakailangan at kasuhan ang mga nagsasabi ng totoo na para sa kanila ay paninira. maniwala sa kung sino-sino, mali daw ang sinasabi ng mga libro. na okay lang mag tiis kasi ganun daw talaga ang buhay at huwag umasa sa gobyerno. at kung ano ano pa. nakikinig lang ako, bilang respeto. kahit papaano, nasa isip ko maswerte pa rin pala ako. natalo lang ang laban at pinaglaban ko sa naganap eleksyon pero hindi nawala sa tama ang pag iisip ko. pag nakikita ko silang pabalik balik sa pila, nag aantay ng libreng masasakyan habang ako kahit papaano kumportable habag ung nararamdaman ko. pero kahit ganoon, nakikita ko rin naman sa kanila na masaya sila sa ganun kwento ng buhay at yun ang realidad. masakit na realidad na kailangan makita ng lahat. na may mga tao na masaya na sa ayuda na okay na sila sa ganun klase ng buhay at malaking bagay yun para sa kanila. so ano ang plano ko? wala. natauhan rin ako kasi hindi ko pala dapat sila iniintindi. na hindi ko obligasyon na isipin sila lagi dahil lang sa nakikita ko na nagkakaganyan sila. nabukasan ang isip ko na sanay na sila sa ganyan buhay. normal na yan sa kanila. pero hindi ko rin naman nakikita ang sarili ko na sasaya kasi ganyan sila. tao pa rin naman ako. siguro, oo, may paminsan minsan na papasok sa isip ko na “deserve” pero pipigilan ko. siguro hanggang dun lang muna ako. nararamdaman ko rin kasi na habang bumaba ang kalidad ng pagiging isang tao ngayon. na hindi na yata ang uso ang nag iisip, nagbabasa at gumagamit ng utak naamoy ko na matagal tagal tayong mapagsasamantalahan. siguro, oo. naisahan nila tayo. pero pakiramdam ko pinagbibigyan lang sila ng mga tao, inuunawa, kung paano natin tinatanggap at pinag papasensyahan ung mga mahal natin sa buhay na alam naman natin na wala talagang maasahan. pero nag uumpisa pa lang ang laban. bawat taon may mga uusbong na bagong botante. at sila ung bagong pag asa para sa bagong hinaharap. mga kabataan, kayo na ang bahala sa amin. sa inyo kami naka asa. imulat niyo ang mga mata niyo sa tama at mali dahil kapag nakapag desisyon kayo ng tama, kayo ang mas makikinabang sa mga desisyon niyo. at para sa mga kagaya namin na nandito na, malas lang namin talaga dahil samin natyempo ung ganitong klase ng sitwasyon. sa susunod na pagkakataon ang sarap sigurong itanong, “masaya po ba kayo sa sitwasyon natin lahat ngayon?!”",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/xlhqol/a_day_in_the_life_of_a_88m_supporter/,23 09 2022

We need to volunteer.,"it’s been two weeks since i joined the house to house talakayan for leni. we are targeting the class d and e sectors. honestly, never pa naman kami naka encounter ng hostile and angry mobs. polite naman sila pag nagdedecline, sasabihin nila busy sila, or may pupuntahan, etc. pero just like what tricia robredo said, ibang iba ang situation sa ground, lalo na sa mga class d and e communities. like sa isang bahay na may tarp ni leni, anim o pitong bahay ang kay baby m. don’t get me wrong, sobrang lakas ng sorties ni leni. pero the problem is, it’s becoming an echo chamber. mangilan ngilan lang ang nacoconvert ng sorties. we can’t also discount the fact na mostly class a to c ang nasa sorties. leni’s demographic weakness are class d and e people, which kung mag vovolunteer ka, makikita mo na that’s the reality right now. may nakausap kami na supporter kung bakit di siya pumunta sa pasig, sabi niya, “eh mukhang pang mayaman kasi yung lugar.” mararamdaman mo na they feel intimidated by other kakampinks. based lang naman yan sa experience namin sa house to house. also, napaka konti naming volunteers. parang sa sabado, 10 lang ata ang nag sign up. to think na nasa las piñas kami. sana kung pupunta tayo sa sorties, mag invite tayo ng isang tao mula sa class d and e, lalo na yung mga undecided. samahan natin silang makinig para di sila mailang. the problem kasi with other kakampinks, na di ko naman nilalahat, is they tend to feign moral, socio-economic, and intellectual superiority over others, kaya tuloy di tayo makahatak. alao, let’s do more solidarity walk rather than caravans. mostly naman siguro sa atin dito ay may sasakyn, pero yung ibang wala hindi makasama pag caravans. and please, talk to your local volunteers. they need help. kung nahihiya ka makipag usap, samahan mo lang sila. mainit, papawisan ka, mapapagod, pero sobrang worth it. so fellow redittors, 700k na ata tayo dito, please volunteer. huwag na tayo mag antay mg next sortie bago ipakita ang ating suporta. ps. i posted din sa fb ko and twitter, pero syempre, fb is a babym socmed, and twitter, well, they’re noisy, but they always side with convenience. pps. educate without insult. ppps. may solidarity walk po kami sa saturday dito sa las piñas. 6 am nga lang. pppps. yung mga volunteer groups from different areas, comment niyo dito, and contact person. edit: saturday po pala ang solidarity walk. pasensya po sa wrong info.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/tl37ja/we_need_to_volunteer/,23 03 2022

How Incompetent Polices are (S/O Cainta + Taytay),"warning: semi-long post. for context: incident was paghablot ng phone sa tapat ng bahay resulting to access to online bank and e-wallets unauthorized transactions. dumulog na kami sa tanggapan ng kapulisan, gabi nang nangyari ang insidente, sa kabisig cainta, ang sabi ng pulis 1 ay kung gusto raw namin, dumiretso kami sa cybercrime sa taytay. nanakawan kami pero hindi naalok na mag pablotter agad. thanks for entertaining us tho. kinabukasan, nagpunta kami sa cybercrime ng taytay, diversion road (as advised ni pulis 1). ang sabi doon ay dapat pinablotter ito sa unang police station na napuntahan dahil sa paghablot na naganap. ang inaaccomodate na kaso kadalasan sa cybercrime ay yung mga online transactions lang, meaning sa online din nagkakausap. machika ang mga pulis na to, gusto pa ako mag apply sa kanila. instead na mag focus sa story, inalam pa pati personals like university graduated, civil status. nag chika pa siya na, pupunta sila sa tagaytay later that day, masarap mag bulalo. fck. bumalik kami sa kabisig, cainta police station, ibang pulis ang nakaduty. sabi ni pulis 2, dahil sa mga kailangang signatory ng police report, sa munisipyo ng cainta raw kami mag complain at humingi siya ng pasensya. agad kaming nagtungo sa cainta police station katabi ng fire station sa munisipyo. habang kinakausap namin ang pulis 3, na tila walang interes sa sinasalaysay namin, tinatanong niya kung para saan ang police report. in short, sabi niya, hindi naman daw kailangan ang police report sa pagpa block or retrieve ng number sa globe or ntc. na parang ang dating ng sinabi niya samin ay, so kung hindi kailangan ng police report, hindi mo rin papakinggan yung complain namin? bakit hindi raw sa barangay nag pa blotter? nagsemi burst out na ko. una, hindi namin kilala yung suspects. paano kung armado pa sila? at anong mapapala sa pag pa blotter sa barangay? anong next action? napilitan siya mag pasagot ng incident report form, after non, sinalin niya sa log book (yung blue) in hand written. naka upo lang kami. sabi niya “okay na po. na blotter na” nagtaka ako wala man lang inabot na kung ano sa amin. ganun na siguro yung “blotter” na tinatawag. nagtanong ako kung “wala bang printed nito”. saka pa lamang nag paprint, ito na siguro yung police report. meron akong kausap sa call dahil sa kainipan ko kaya nasa labas ako. pagbalik ko sa loob nasa kasama ko na ang police report. umalis na kami. nag lunch muna. pinatingin ko sa iba yung police report via online. mali raw yung petsa. hindi na kasi namin check pag kakuha pag kalabas yung police report. naglagay sila ng info sa police report na ang petsa ay hindi pa nangyayari. 1pm palang noon, sa papel, 2pm daw ng araw na iyon nangyari. papaanong nakapagpa print kayo ng hindi niyo nirereview ang nakasulat or even ask us to review it? basta binigay lang? btw, may kasabay kaming nagrereport din, carnapping incident, pinahiram kami ng ballpen (thank you). nag-abot sila ng pera sa mga pulis pero verbally tumanggi sila, pero tinanggap ang pera. imagine, ang pakiramdam, na para kaming pinag pasa pasahan ng mga kapulisan. basta nag pa print ng police report na hindi tinitignan ng tama ang detalye. kahit may cctv, may dala kaming videos, ni-isa walang nag alok na tignan to. dahil din siguro sa pagnanakaw lang ito. napaka incompetent. kung hahalungkatin, maraming nagaganap sa area namin. i never thought how incompetent polices are, 'till i experience this with them, first hand. madada sila but their actions reflect their big tummies. i imagine paano nila hinahabol ang suspects with their dad bods. maybe, this is one of the reasons din why some people resorts na ilagay sa mga kamay nila ang batas. i understand them now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/17eb6ic/how_incompetent_polices_are_so_cainta_taytay/,23 10 2023

"In the Philippines, What's your most favorite overused Networking/MLM lines or quotes that they usually used when inviting a new member to join them?","i've been a part of **usana, frontrow, uno, emgoldex, kapa** and many more to mention. the only cult (group) that i had succeeded the most (in terms of financial gain) is kapa, probably because i joined them late 2017 nung hindi pa sila mainit sa mata ng government. by the time na na shutdown na sila nakuha ko na ng more than 10x yung ininvest ko. these are some of the things i can remember coming out of their mouth while inviting a newbie: 1.

hanggang ngayon ay wala pa rin kaming ideya kung bakit. magmula sa pagsigaw ni cecil ng, “anong nangyari?! anak, anong nangyari?!” sa tulalang alex na nakatitig sa dilat na mga mata ni joe, hanggang sa pagpunta namin dito sa aking opisina sa barangay, ay wala pa rin kaming makuhang rason mula sa bakit. sa isang maliit na kwarto sa aking opisina’y pinaupo ko muna si alex. tulala at sinusubukang burahin ang dugo sa kanyang mukha gamit ang duguan ring damit n’ya. hinainan ko ng isang bote ng softdrinks at tatlong pandesal mula pa sa agahan namin kanina si alex, na agad namang n’yang kinain ng walang pag-aalinlangan. dito na nagsimulang gumapang ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod. isang kilabot na hindi ko maipaliwanag, habang pinapanood ko si alex na walang awat sa pagkain, habang ako’y hindi ko pa rin magawang matakam sa masarap na lutong nag-aabang sa’kin sa bahay. “alex,” marahan kong sinabi. “ba’t mo ginawa ‘yun?” tumingin lamang sa’kin si alex, patay na mga mata, bibig na mabagal ang nguya. at sa kanyang paglunok ay walang mga salitang bumalik sa’kin. hindi ko alam kung bakit pero bigla kong naalala si jefferson, isang tricycle driver dito sa’min. dalawang taon na ang nakakalipas nang mapatay n’ya ang isang dayo na nakaaway n’ya sa kalsada. nangyari ‘to nang kamuntikan n’yang makasalpukan ang sasakyan ng dayo, at nang nahinto silang dalawa’y nagkasagutan muna sila bago mapikon si jefferson. hinampas n’ya ng bakal na tubo ang dayo. hindi na raw n’ya napigilan dahil sa mga mapanglait na mga salitang tinawag sa kanya. bobo, unggoy, uling, mababa. labing-isang beses paulit-ulit na hinampas ni jefferson sa ulo ang dayo, at sa sobrang lakas ng bawat hampas ay may parte na ng utak na lumabas dito. sa prisinto’y naalala ko si jefferson, iyak nang iyak at humihingi ng tawad dahil sa nangyari. hindi makakain, hindi rin makatulog. nilamon na s’ya ng konsensya n’ya, at ang konsensya n’ya ang tumulak sa kanya na agawin ang baril ng isa sa mga pulis na nagbabantay, at iputok sa kanyang sariling ulo. nasaktan si jefferson, nagalit, at di nakapagpigil. naintindihan ko ang kwento ‘nun. pero bakit hindi ko maintindihan ‘to? alam kong magkasundo ang magkapatid na ‘to. alam ko kung ga’no sila kalapit sa isa’t-isa. kaya pa’no nangyari ‘to? ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod ay gumagapang paakyat hanggang sa aking dibdib, tila ba kumakapit ng mahigpit. pasikip nang pasikip at medyo nahihirapan akong huminga. ang kakaibang pakiramdam na ‘to’y tumitindi habang nanatiling tahimik at nakatitig lamang sa’kin si alex. biglang iniabot ni alex ang kanyang kamay at dito tumalon na ang puso ko. napaatras ako sa aking kinauupuan, at mabilisan kong hinugot ang aking rosaryo mula sa pagkakatago nito sa aking damit. itinutok ko ito kay alex, na walang ibang kibo kun’di ang kunin ang bote ng softdrinks na nasa harapan n’ya. mas bumilis pa ang pagkatok sa aking dibdib, na para bang kamuntikan na kong mamatay. habang si alex nama’y pinapanood lang ako habang patuloy ang kanyang pag-inom. wala nga ata talagang mangyayari, at nang maramdaman ko kung gaano katahimik ang kwarto’y kumalma na ako. bakit sa dulo ng utak ko’y hinihiling ko na may sapi o di kaya’y isang demonyo talaga ang kaharap ko, at sa presensya ng aking rosaryo’y masasaktan s’ya. kahit anong kakaiba. kahit ano basta magkaroon lang ng eksplenasyon ang nangyari. pero siguro’y kakaiba na rin ang ikinikilos ng bata. at siguro nga’y mas dapat talaga akong matakot sa buhay kaysa sa patay. **cecil** “saan ba ko nagkulang?” tanong ni aling cecil sa mga kumare n’yang nakapalibot sa kanya sa masikip na opisina ni chairmain. napapaligiran din s’ya ng makukulay na mga pamaypay na hindi sabay-sabay ang pagaspas sa harap n’ya; nilulunod si aling cecil sa hangin. ang kanyang mukha nama’y tila ba isang rebulto ng santo kung punas-punasan ng mga panyo. “hindi ko pa rin maintindihan,” dugtong n’ya. “hindi naman ako nagkulang sa aruga. pareho ko namang pinapakita sa kanila na pantay ang pagmamahal ko sa kanila.” tuyo na ang mga mata ni aling cecil, ngunit tila ba hindi pa rin tapos ang kanyang pag-iyak. “hindi sila nag-aaway. hindi ko man lang narinig na nagtalo silang dalawa. o kung may pagtatalo man, malamang sa malamang maliit na bagay lang ‘yun. hindi yung ikakamatay mo!” isang labi ng lumapit sa tenga ni aling cecil, “alam mo tingin ko, baka inggit ‘yan. kasi si joe lang may trabaho sa kanilang dalawa, di ba? tapos si alex, wala pa rin sa kolehiyo. nag-aaral pa rin. sigurado akong ‘yun ang dahilan.” isa pang labi ang lumapit sa kabilang tenga naman ni aling cecil, “baka napikon na. kasi di ba halos s’ya na sa lahat ng gawaing bahay? baka pakiramdam n’ya porke’t mas malaki ambag ng kapatid n’ya , alila na s’ya neto.” isang labi naman na kaharap ni aling cecil ang nagsabing, “baka nagbabait-baitan lang kasi nga si joe ang halos sumasalo sa mga bayarin, pati sa pag-aaral n’ya. pero galit talaga s’ya, kasi baka naman may pagkakataong mas nabibigyang-atensyon si joe kahit hindi n’yo napapansin. kasi halimbawa uuwi s’yang pagod galing sa trabaho, syempre di n’yo maiwasang alagaan, pagsilbihan.” sa gitna ng mga labing ito’y si aling cecil, at ang ideyang unti-unting nabubuo dahil sa mga sinasabi ng mga labi sa kanya. “siguro,” sabi n’ya. “siguro nga.” **abbie** ang pangalan n’ya’y abbie. social worker daw s’ya. pagpasok n’ya’y agad bumungad sa’kin ang asul na bra sa ilalim ng dilaw na blouse nang tapatan ito ng liwanag mula sa bintanang katabi ko. sa kanyang pagtali ng buhok ay nakita kong basang-basa na ang kanyang kili-kili at kumikinang na sa pawis ang kanyang leeg. “alex?” sabi n’ya habang maya’t-mayang tinutulak ng kanyang daliri ang salamin n’yang dumudulas sa kanyang matangos na ilong. “bakit di mo ikwento muna sa’kin ang nangyari bago tayo umalis dito?” pasensya ka na, abbie. hindi ko nagawang sabihin kay chairman, na kilala pa mandin namin. hinding-hindi ko rin masasabi sa’yo. walang ibang maglalahad ng nangyari kun’di ang mga taong nais magbigay kahulugan dito, kasi kung ako tatanungin kung bakit, sa totoo lang, hindi ko rin alam ang isasagot. may nabasag akong bote sa kusina kanina, at sa pagpulot ko nito’y pumasok sa isip ko ang isang udyok. yung tipo ng udyok kapag nasa mataas kang lugar, at bigla mo na lang gustong itulak ang kasama mo. pero alam mong hindi ito dapat gawin, at kakapit ka pa nang mas mahigpit sa kanila para masiguro mong hindi ito mangyayari. ang udyok na ito’y nagsabi sa’kin na isaksak ko kay kuya ang basag na bote. at nalaman ko na lang na totoo na pala ang lahat nang dumapo sa aking balat ang mainit na dugo ni kuya. nahinto lang ako nang maramdaman ko ang buto sa leeg n’ya at nang marinig kong nabibilaukan na s’ya sa kanyang sariling dugo. hindi ko pa rin alam kung bakit. sana, tulad ng iniisip ni chairman, ay nasapian na nga lang ako. pero nakita ko ang lahat, andun ako. hindi ko lang alam na totoo pala ang lahat. namatay si kuya joe sa wala. at hindi ko matanggap na wala. normal lang sana ang sabado namin. tahimik. nanonood lang si kuya ng tv, naglilinis ako sa kusina. si nanay nama’y namamalengke ng pananghalian namin. bicol express daw ang lulutuin n’ya. puta, sinira ko ang araw. gusto kong umiyak dahil hindi na kami babalik sa salo-salo namin. “alex?” muling tawag ni abbie. “gusto kong malaman kung bakit. tayong dalawa lang. kaibigan mo ko dito. hinding-hindi ko ‘to sasabihin sa nanay mo, sa mga kapitbahay n’yo. may mga naririnig ako sa labas na dahil daw sa inggit? totoo ba ‘to? sa inggit nga? magmula nang dinala ako ni chairman dito sa maliit na kwartong ito’y napagpasyahan kong manahimik na lang sa nangyari. sa ngayo’y nilalabanan ko ang mga luha, nilalabanan ko ang panginginig ng aking bibig, at ang mga salitang gustong lumabas mula sa’kin. dapat mukhang hindi ko pinagsisisihan. dapat mukha akong galit. para naman mabigyang halaga, mabigyan ng ibig-sabihin ang pagkamatay ni kuya joe. dapat tinatatak ko sa utak ko na dapat lang! dapat lang sa kanya ang nangyari. dapat hindi ako bibigay. dahil kapag natalo ako, mamatay talaga sa wala si kuya. “sige, kung ayaw mong magkwento, ako muna. kasi naalala ko ‘tong isang batang babae at ang tatay n’yang abusado. tatay n’yang lasinggero. tatay n’yang isang beses s’yang hinipuan sa kanyang sariling kwarto at pinilit. ampon ang batang ‘yon, at tatay-tatayan n’ya lang etong umaabuso sa kanya. takot na takot ang bata dahil pakiramdam n’ya isang gabi’y papatayin na lang s’ya bigla neto. kaya naman isang gabi, nang bigla s’yang pinuntahan ng kanyang tatay upang pagsamantalahan ulit, sinasaksak ito ng bata gamit ang lapis sa mata, sa leeg, at sa dibdib.” kumuha ng panyo si abbie. sa kanyang paggalaw ay muling sumisilip ang kanyang bra sa likod ng blouse na parang mga batang naglalaro sa likod ng kurtina. “masarap sa pakiramdam, pero pumapatay pa rin s’ya ng tao. ilan taon n’yang dinibdib ‘yun. hanggang ngayon nararamdaman pa rin n’ya ang mga kamay ng tatay n’ya sa kanyang ari. sa kanyang dibdib. ilang taon bago n’ya matanggap ang ginawa n’ya. ngayon, medyo mahirap pa ring ikwento, pero kahit papaano’y kaya ko na. nangyari na kasi.” para bang may sumuntok sa aking dibdib nang marinig ko ‘to. bigla kong tinanggal ang aking paningin sa kanyang bra, at sa paggalaw ng aking mga mata’y bigla kong naramdaman ang pamumuo ng mga luha. “ayos lang, alex. pero andito lang ako. aalagaan ka muna namin. tapos pag handa ka na, makikinig ako. kahit pakonte-konte pa, ayos lang. aantayin kong mabuo ang kwento mo.” bumibilis bigla ang tibok ng puso ko. lalong nanginginig ang aking labi. at biglang pumasok si kuya sa isip ko, tumatakbo papalayo sa akin. mga bata pa kami, at hinahabol ko s’ya. “alex?” kuya wag kang lumayo! “alex?” kuya dito ka lang! kailangan kita dito! “sige, ayusin na natin pag-alis mo.” at parang isang batang nadapa sa semento, dito na walang awat na tumulo ang luha sa aking mga mata. “alex?” “hindi ko rin alam… hindi… ko rin alam. sorry, kuya! sorry! hindi ko rin alam kung bakit! patayin n’yo na lang ako! hindi ko alam anong nangyari! hindi ko na kaya!” lumalabo na ang aking paningin, pero kahit ga’no kalabo ang aking mga mata’y kitang-kita ko ang gulat at takot sa mukha ni abbie. pasensya ka na, kuya.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/nlygsa/alex_tanghaling_tapat_ng_sabado_2021/,27 05 2021

Tagalized Story.,"may story ako. ako lang ang nag-iisang babae sa pinag-tatrabahuhan kong kumpanya at alam ko na kung bakit. isa akong fresh graduate sa kolehiyo at gusto ko na talagang makapag-simula ng career agad-agad na walang kinalaman sa pagse-serve ng pagkain, pagpupunas ng mga gamit, o pag-dadala o timpla ng kape sa isang matandang negosyante. sa naka-sanayan nag-aapply ako sa trabaho na may anim na araw na trabaho at marami-rami na rin akong interview na napagdaanan. alam ko na ang tinapos kong hrm na kurso ay hindi gaanong makaka-kuha ng magandang oportunidad, pero naniniwala pa rin ako na may mas maganda pang trabaho na naghihintay sa akin. kaya naman nanatili akong positibo, matyaga, at nag-aapply lang sa mga office jobs na may magandang benipisyo. kahit halos wala na akong mapag-kunan ng makakain dahil sa magastos na mga interview, at least mapapag-tibay naman nito ang kakaunting pride na natitira sa akin. halos tatlong linggo na rin ang nakalipas, may isa akong phone interview sa isang internet security company. ang kumpanyang iyon ay maraming offices sa amin at naghahanap sila ng bagong customer support specialist para sa kanilang international department. ang mga requirements ay maganda o mahinahon na boses, good spoken and written grammar, kakaunting tech-knowledge, at may kakayahang mag-trabaho sa umaga at gabi. ang office ay dalawang sakay lang sa mula sa amin, at mayroon silang magandang offer sa health insurance. nag-aapply ako kahit lmitado lang din ang alam ko sa computer science. naging maayos naman ang phone interview at matapos ang dalawang meetings sa hr at sa management, binigyan nila ako ng isang napaka-gandang offer (kahit na wala pa talaga akong experience sa kahit anong trabaho). sa loob ng unang linggo ko, kailangan kong magtrabaho nang regular shift na 9-5 (am) para maging online ako kasabay ng manager ko, na nag-trabaho sa ibang branch ng kumpanya. pagkatapos noon ay kailangan kong magtrabaho para sa regular na schedule ko bilang support - ang schedule ko ay 6 na araw na pasok (09:00 am -05:00 pm (am) at may isang araw na night shift 09:00 pm - 05:00 am respectively). sa unang araw ko, ang suot ko ay isang loose na sweater at mahabang skirt. bilang sa kaalaman ko ay sa ganitong uri ng trabaho ay karamihan mga lalaki ang empleyado, ayaw ko naman mag-cause ng unnecessary attention dahil sa provocatively o inappropriately pag-susuot ng hindi naayon na attire. ang lalaki sa front desk ay mukha namang maayos na tao. pinakilala n'ya ang sarili n'ya bilang si andrew bago n'ya ako tulungang mag-fill out ng mga paperwork at sinamahan n'ya na ako sa aking mesa at sa isang open space na workspace. nakatitig lang ako sa tila walang katapusang mga desks habang naglalakad kami, napansin ko na halos hindi mo makikita ang mga mukha ng bawat taong nagta-trabaho na naka-upo sa bawat desks. wala man lang akong nakita o napansin na babae habang nag-lalakad kami sa tila baga'y walang katapusang workspace na iyon, na talaga namang hindi normal at nakaka-bahala. kahit ang kalmadong presensya ni andrew ay hindi kayang maiwaglit ang wari kakaibang pakiramdam na naka-tuon sa akin. halos maubusan ako ng hininga ng maramdaman ko ang mga presensya ng bagong kong co-workers na tila nagsasabi na ""hindi ka nababagay dito"". nagulat ako ng biglang huminto si andrew sa isang desk na napuno ng mga printed memes, floral stickers, at isang lumang keychain na naka-patong sa harap ng monitor. bukod pa doon ay natatakpan na rin ng makapal na alikabok ang keyboard, monitor at ang natitirang ispasyo ng desk. ""ahhh... anong nangyari..."" sabi ni andrew sa medyo upset na boses. ""pasensya ka na."" sabi nito habang nakatingin sa aking mga papeles. ""ah... aya. dapat matagal na 'tong nalinis. kailangan kong maka-usap ang custodian"". ""ok lang 'yun"", sagot ko. ""puwede ko namang punasan na lang 'yan, wala namang problema"". medyo asiwa na noon si andrew, pero habang ginagala ko ang aking paningin ay malinaw na wala ng ibang bakanteng desk maliban doon. mabilis na natapos ang araw na iyon. natutunan ko na ang mga dapat kung gawin na sumagot sa support related phone calls at gumawa ng bagong ticket para sa system. kailangan ko ring i-monitor ang lahat ng pumapasok na chats at written tickets at isaayos ito base sa level ng urgency at type nito. hindi naman ako required mag-bigay ng technical advice, pero dapat maging pamilyar ako sa aming product software. bilang wala pa namang mga tawag ay pinaki-alaman ko muna ang manual. halos wala akong maintindihan sa mga naroon kaya naman ginogle ko na lang ang karamihan na nasa manual. kinumusta ako noon ng manager ko at mukhang hindi s'ya masaya sa mga lapses ko sa mga materials. dahil pakiramdam ko wala akong matinong nagawa at gagawin sa mga oras na iyon ay panandalian akong nag-break para linisin ang mesa ko. tumayo ako para tanungin si andrew kung saan makaka-kuha ng basahan para sa mesa ko. agad-agad kong pinagsisihan ang desisyon kong iyon. ang bawat mata sa kwarto ay tila napako sa pagtayo ko sa aking kinauupuan. hindi ako sigurado pero maraming mga bulungan akong narinig habang papalayo ako sa aking mesa. ang kaninang maingay na mga keyboard ay pahina nang pahina na halos kainin na ako ng lupa sa sobrang hindi ko pagiging kumportable at self-conscious na rin at the same time. napansin ko na lang na halos halikan ko na ang dibdib ko sa pagyuko para lang hindi ako mapansin. bago ako maka-rating sa isang palikong daan patungo sa front desk ay buong-lakas kong tinignan ang isang tila walang hiyang lalaki na nakatitig sa akin. hindi ko alam kung ano ang inaasahan ko, pero 'yung overall appearance ng lalaking naka-hooding pang-asar na 'yun ay nagbigay ng matinding kilabot sa buong katawan ko. siguro mga ka-edad ko s'ya pero hindi man lang s'ya nahiya o natinag sa pagkaka-titig n'ya sa akin sa kabila ng pagtitig ko sa kanya na may halong pagka-bwisit at inis. isang kakila-kilabot na ngiti ang sumilaw sa mga labi nito habang naka-titig sa parteng bukong-bukong ng aking mga paa at dahan-dahan itong bumalik sa kanyang monitor. inisip ko kung anong magiging reaksyon n'ya kapag tinitigan ko rin ng kaparehong paraan ng pagtitig n'ya sa akin ang tinitigyawat n'yang leeg. parehong reaksyon pa rin ang nakuha ko habang naglalakad ako pabalik sa aking mesa kasama ang box ng computer wipes sa mga kamay ko. may maganda ring nangyari sa araw na iyon. habang nililinis ko ang mga drawer ng mesa ko ay may nakita akong half-used notebook mula sa nakaraang nagta-trabaho sa mesa ko. hindi n'ya nilagay ang first name n'ya, kundi initial lang at last name: j. espiritu. pero, base sa dekorasyon ng notebook, sigurado ako na babae rin s'ya kagaya ko. ang mga naiwan n'yang gamit ay nagbigay ng kapanatagan sa akin, pero 'yung notebook ang talagang pumukaw ng atensyon ko. doon ay sinabi nito ang pina-ikli at simpleng manual gamit ang easy-to-undertand terms at mga explenasyon sa nakaka-litong terminolohiya at komplikadong panuto sa manual. sa tulong n'ya ay nasurpresa ko ang aking manager sa aking product knowledge pagkatapos ng shift ko. matapos ang isang magandang araw ay buong tapang akong gumala sa office at nag-explore sa pantry. binenta ni andrew sa akin ang top-notch coffee machine at snacks sa nasabing pantry, tutal nagugutom na rin naman ako matapos ang isang emotionally, intellectually and productive na araw na 'yun. (ansabe). tsaka, medyo butas na rin 'yung bulsa at namumula na ang mga credit cards ko, kaya naman ayos na ako sa ilang pirasong masasarap na cookies. habang papalapit ako ay may narinig akong malakas na usapan at tawanan sa pantry. sa katangahan ko ay inisip ko na baka naman mas mainit, friendly o kahit maka-tao na sila sa akin. subalit ang maliit na pantry ay napuno ng katahimikan the moment na pumasok ako sa pantry. may limang lalaki doon na mag-kakaiba ang edad at lalaki na naka-upo sa palibot ng isang maliit na lamesa, at lahat sila ay naka-titig na direkta sa akin. ""panget na araw?"" - tugon ng isang pang-asar na boses. agad kong itinaas ang ulo ko mula sa pagkaka-titig sa sahig para hanapin ang pinag-mulan ng boses. hindi naging mahirap sa aking hanapin at malaman na mula iyon sa naka-hoodie na walang-hiyang tumitig sa akin nung nakaraan lang. ""siguro marami ka ng experience?"" - sambit pa nito sa nakaka-asar na tono at may-unting pag-taas ng kilay. ""para makakuha ng komportableng trabaho. siguro sikat ka?"". ""ano 'to, high-school?"" - sagot ko sa malakas na boses. hindi ko hilig kumompronta ng tao, pero sobra na 'to. hostility is one thing, social awkwardness is another, pero pakiramdam ko isa 'tong 80's na high-school drama na mga trenta anyos ang mga bida bilang mga teenagers. ""nandito lang ako para kumuha kape at kung may problema ka sa trabaho ko, puwede mong dalhin sa hr kung ano man ang issue mo"". nagpatuloy ako habang ine-enjoy ang namumutla at pahiyang mukha ng mga taong 'yun. mabuti naman, gusto kong maramdaman nila ang katiting na discomfort na buong araw kung kinakaharap. pinili kong lumayo sa aking mga co-workers, naglakad ako ng taas noo pabalik sa mesa ko na may hawak-hawak na tasa ng kape. bago pa ako maka-upo at enjoyin ang masarap na kape, napansin kong may isang mensahe galing sa hindi kilalang number: ""you have quite an attitude, don't you?"" nanigas ako habang hawak ang cell phone sa isa kong kamay at kape sa kabila. habang prino-proseso ko ang tila breach sa personal security ko, naka-tanggap ulit ako ng dalawa pang mensahe. isa ay ang hubo't-hubad kong katawan na sinend ko sa una kong serious college boyfriend. ang pangalawa: ""bakit hindi mo ngayon ibigay 'yang picture sa hr?"" sa totoo lang, sobrang naapektuhan ako sa invasion ng privacy ko. pumasok ang kahihiyan sa akin at sobrang naiinis ako for drawing so much unwanted attention sa sarili ko. kasalanan ko lahat 'to. pumasok ako sa isang office na puno ng ethical hackers na may pare-parehong pangalan ng aso bilang password. walang duda na ang litratong iyon ay umiikot na sa buong office at lahat ng iyon ay salamat sa walang hiyang ka-trabaho ko, at isa na akong kakatuwang tao sa loob ng office. hindi ko na ginalaw ang kape ko at umuwi na lang, habang pinipigilan ko ang bawat emosyon na bumuhos hanggang makarating ako sa safety ng bahay. halos hindi ako matigil sa kaiiyak nung gabing 'yun, iniisip ko na ang mga mukha ng mga ka-trabaho ko habang tigang na tigang na nakatitig sa hubad kong katawan. mga alas tres na ng madaling araw, doon ko lang na-realize na wala ng kwenta para pa magpaka-lunod ako sa kahihiyan. kailangan kong gumawa ng plano para maka-survive sa ganitong uri ng workplace. quitting is not an option kasi masyadong malaki ang pasweldo nila para tumigil ako. tsaka, halos tinapay na lang ang kaya kong bilhin sa araw-araw. ang pangalawa kong option ay pumunta sa hr, but there's no way i was going to open that can of worms. hindi ko mapapatunayan kong sino talaga ang nag-send ng mga mensahe na iyon. last option? stick with it, keep my head down, gawin ang trabaho na pinasukan ko at 'wag pansinin ang iba pang mga harassment na gagawin nila. 'yun nga ang ginawa ko. sa kabuuan ng isang linggong training ko ay pumapasok ako on time, hindi ako umaalis sa desk ko liban na lang kung pupunta sa palikuran. iniwasan ko rin ang kahit anong contact kanino man at pinanatili ko lang ang aking mga mata sa mga inanimate objects. salamat kay j. espiritu, palagi akong on top ng training ko. sa bawat bagong task na galing sa manager ko, laging may katumbas na entry sa kanyang notebook. wala ng nakaka-gagong texts at face-to-face na kumprontasyon, pero mayroong kakatuwang pakiramdam na panibagong sisira sa kalagayan ko. sa darating na biyernes na ang huling training ko, na nagdala sa akin sa huling entry sa notebook. night shift survival guide: - matulog sa buong umaga bago ang shift at 'wag na 'wag kang matutulog. - walang sino man ang dapat maka-pasok. - panatilihing may pepper spray na dala. (sa kahit anong sitwasyon). - i-check ang bawat aisle, meeting rooms. huwag kalimutang i-check ang ilalim ng lamesa, balkonahe, kitchen tables at kahit likod ng cooler. - laging mag-open ng skype na naka-ready sa emergency in case na hindi gumana ang mobile services. - panatilihing updated sa kaibigan/pamilya/lover kada oras. ang nasabing listahan ay medyo may kahulugan. una, sabi ng hr puwede naman akong matulog sa pagitan ng 2-5 am, basta malapit palagi sa akin ang office smartphone. mayroon nga silang pull out couch sa isang conference room para lang talaga sa ganitong sitwasyon. pangalawa, ang buong shift ay phone calls, kaya palaging may paraan para maka-tawag mula sa office phone, tama? lastly, ang mga naka-outlined sa ""guide"" ay parang o.a at paranoid. siguro 'yung listahan ay satirical? (ewan ko). siguro si espiritu parehas kami ng pakiramdam tungkol sa mga tila patay gutom na mga asong cold-blooded na co-workers? pero 'yung isip ko nag-tatrabaho ng sobra-sobra para makita ang logic sa likod ng mga pag-iingat na ito. may kakatuwa akong pakiramdam na may importanteng impormasyon akong hindi nalalaman. lahat 'yun iniisip ko habang paalis ako ng bahay nung biyernes na 'yun, last day ng training ko. ""andrew"", - dahan-dahan akong lumapit sa kanya. ""puwede ba mag-tanong?"" ""sure thing"", - sagot n'ya na may maaliwalas na ngiti sa kanyang mga labi. ""nagtataka lang ako, bakit wala akong nakikitang ibang support agents. i mean, 'di ba dapat merong at least lima pang tao para ma-cover 'yung six-day rotation cycle?"" ""kailangan mong tanungin ang manager mo tungkol d'yan. most likely naka-kalat sila sa iba pang branch sa syudad. normal lang naman 'yun sa ganoong kaso"", - sagot n'ya. pakiramdam ko tapos na kami sa diskusyon na 'yun matapos s'yang bumalik sa final tasks n'ya para sa linggong iyon. ""meron bang ibang agent na nag-trabaho dito liban sa akin?"" - pagpapatuloy ko, dahil ganun na lamang ang kagustuhan kong malaman ang iba pang detalye sa babaeng nag-fill out ng notebook na s'ya namang ginagamit ko sa buong linggong iyon. ""oo, may isang babae na humawak sa posisyon mo ng panandalian"", - ani ni andrew, habang naka-titig pa rin sa screen ng kanyang screen. pero napansin kong tumigil na s'ya sa pag-tatype o pag-galaw ng mouse. wari ko ay naka-titig lang s'ya sa iisang spot sa monitor n'ya. ""andrew"", - nag-salubong ang mga kilay ko. ""sino 'yung nag-trabaho malapit sa main working space na talagang nakaka-inis? maputla, medyo payat, maitim at kulot na buhok?"" - tanong ko, habang nagpapaikot ng daliri sa bandang ulunan ko para i-describe ang pagkaka-kulot ng nasabing lalake. ""ah... si michael"", - sagot nito, napansin nito ang pagiging iritable ng boses ko. ""may problema ba? ginugulo ka ba n'ya?"" ""hindi"" - sagot ko, pero sa isip-isip ko ay nagtatalo na ang emosyon at sarili ko. ""have a good weekend, andrew"" ""ikaw din"", - sagot nito, halata na may pagtataka sa boses nito habang papaalis ako. sa buong weekend na 'yun ay binabalik-balikan ko ang mga nangyari sa akin sa unang linggo ko. pakiramdam ko may hindi sinasabi si andrew sa akin na importante. wala namang rason para maging iretable s'ya nung nabanggit ko 'yung babaeng nag-trabaho bago ako. may nag-reklamo na kaya kay michael dati? pu-puwede kayang si j. espiritu? si michael ba ang dahilan ng survival guide sa notebook? bakit s'ya umalis? napaka-daming teorya ang bumagabag sa buong weekend ko. bago ko pa nalaman, oras na para bumalik sa trabaho. ito ang araw na talagang sobrang daming trabaho. kahapon ay lunes, ang unang regular day shift. mabilis lang dumaan ang nasabing araw, habang aligaga ako sa pag-sagot ng tawag, recording, sorting at assigning ng dose-dosenang customer complaints sa system namin. hindi sapat ang salitang nasanay na ako at pagkatapos ng araw na 'yun ay sobrang pagod at ubos na ako. saktong maglo-logout na ako, naka-tanggap na naman ako ng mensahe mula sa hindi kilalang number. ""ang sipag mo naman. hindi na ako makapag-hintay na mag night shift ka"" seryoso?! ito ang kauna-unahang mensahe na bumalot sa buong pagkatao ko ng takot. agad-agad kong ginala ang paningin ko kung nasa paligid ba si michael para kumprontahin ko s'ya sa pagse-send ng mensahe, pero kanina pa pala s'ya umalis. matapos kong pakalmahin ang sarili ko, umuwi na ako at sinusubukan kong hanapin si j. espiritu online. ang pinaka best bet ko noon ay sa linkedin, at doon nga ay sinusubukan kong galugarin ang buong listahan ng mga babae na may kinalaman sa proficient technologies na naka-lagay sa profile nila (halos kakaunti lang talaga sila). nung wala akong makita ay pumunta ako kay andrew at doon nga sa friend list n'ya ay sa wakas nakita ko na ang hinahanap ko. may babae na pangalan ay jennah espiritu at unemployed ang status. nag-send ako ng friend request na may mensahe na nag-papakilala at tinanong ko s'ya kung hinarass ba s'ya ng isa n'yang ka-trabaho. sa wakas, pakiramdam ko may patutunguhan na ako, natulog ako at inihanda ang sarili para sa bukas na event. naisip ko na baka may kakaibang mangyayari dahil sa pagbabago ng schedule nung natulog ako ng miyerkules. nag-check ako ng linkedin halos pagka-gising ko mga ala una. walang kahit anong sign kay jennah, kaya naman natulog ulit ako para makapag-handa sa night shift. medyo kinakabahan ako at excited at the same time kasi puwede ko ng mas malibot ang buong place of work ko intimately. dahil walang day crowd, malaya akong makaka-gala at ma-eenjoy ang cookies, dumura sa baso ni michael, kahit ano! may mga iilan pa ring mga nag-tatrabaho nung dumating ako para sa shift ko, pero hindi ko naman iyon pinansin at dahil sa nag-uumapaw na mga tawag at chats na aasikasuhin. makalipas ang dalawang oras, ang bugso ng mga tawag at chats pati mga tickets ay unti-unting bumagal hanggang tuluyan na nga itong tumigil ng sabay-sabay halos alas onse na ng gabi noon. sumandal ako sa kinauupuan ko at ginala-gala ang mga paningin sa aking workspace. wala ng tao noon sa office at least sa nakikita ko. naka-bukas ang lahat ng ilaw pero nung tinanggal ko ang headphones ko, may narinig akong mahinang jingling melody sa hindi kalayuan. para s'yang christmas carol, pero hirap akong tukuyin kong saan ito nangga-galing. wala namang dahilan para matakot ako sa pangyayari, pero pakiramdam ko ang mga nagtayuang balahibo sa mga kamay ko ay nagsilbing alarm. nang tumayo ako sa aking kinauupuan, nawala 'yung melody. well, naging paranoid na ako dati. minsan ko ng inisip na na may lalaking sumusunod sa akin isang gabi hanggang nilagpasan n'ya ako at nagtungo sa kalapit na tindahan sa 'di kalayuan. kahit mag-isa lang ako, lagi kong dino-double at triple check ang mga lock ng bahay bago matulog. aaminin ko na ang mga takot ko ay wala naman talagang basehan. mayroong naka-iwan ng headphones na konektado pa rin sa computer nito at naka-on ang music. o siguro may office party sa ibang kumpanya sa baba ng building. ang makarinig ng kanta ay nakaka-takot lamang sa mga kakatuwang horror movies, 'di ba? 'di ba?! para maka-siguro, hinalughog ko ang office para maka-siguro na mag-isa na nga lang ako. habang naglalakad sa gitna ng mga magkaka-dikit na desks, naisip ko kung gaano ako ka-swerte na mayroon akong sariling corner spot. hindi ko siguro kakayanin na mapalapit sa kahit sinong mga hindi kaaya-aya kong mga co-workers. matapos ko ma-check ang bawat rows ay dumiretcho ako sa front desk area at nagmamasid sa mga kagamitan ni andrew sa paghahanap ng clues. nung wala akong makitang clues ay bumalik ako sa main room ng pantry. unti-unti ng mas nagiging relaxed ang mga senses ko at tsaka ko lang napag-tanto na napasarap ata ang taste-testing ko sa mga cookies sa halip na mag-hanap ng mga kahina-hinalang mga bagay. kailangan ko ng tumigil sa kaka-kain ng cookies, pero dahil bumalik na naman ang kaninang tunog na naririnig ko, mas malakas s'ya ngayon. at the same time, ang work smartphone ko (na kinakailangan dala-dala namin kung aalis kami sa aming work station) tumunog at may mensahe mula sa hindi na namang kilalang number. so, nag-eenjoy ka ba sa cookies, ha? nanigas ang buong katawan ko habang prino-proseso ng utak ko ang mga pangyayari. siguro hindi talaga umalis ng office si michael at ngayon tinatakot ako. kinalikot ko ang tenga ko noon at nakinig ng maigi. walang kahit sino sa pantry as least sa nakikita at naririnig ko. tsaka, kung si michael ay nasa main workspace, hindi naman ganun kahirap na hulaan o sabihin na kumakain ako ng cookies. habang dahan-dahan akong humihinga, hindi ko muna pinansin ang tunog at nakinig ako ng maigi kung may iba pa akong tunog na maririnig. wala. dahan-dahan, naglakad ako sa may pantry drawers at doon may nakita akong malaking kutsilyo. alam ko bang gumamit ng kutsilyo? hindi. kaya ko kayang paalisin kung sino man ang unarmed na kalaban? syempre. papunta na sana ako pabalik sa aking work station ng biglang may tawag na pumasok mula sa work phone. ipinosisyon ko ang sarili ko ng kumportable sa pader ng pantry, kutsilyo sa kanang kamay, cell phone sa kabila, bago pa ako maka-sagot with the standard customer support greeting. nag static na sa kabilang linya at iba pang ingay sunod ang tuluyang pagka-putol ng linya at katahimikan. nung tinignan ko ang cell phone, nakita kong naka-patay na ito. sinubukan kong buksan ulit ito, pero hindi na ito gumagana. ok, ngayon kailangan ko ng bumalik sa computer ko in case na may pumasok pang mga tawag. naalala ko bigla ang isa sa mga guide na galing kay jennah habang isinusuksok ko ang walang kwentang cell phone sa bulsa ko. - laging mag-open ng skype na naka-ready sa emergency in case na hindi gumana ang mobile services. nangyari rin kaya 'to sa kanya? ang mga instructions sa notebook ay unti-unti ng nagkaroon ng kahulugan, at minumura ko ang sarili ko dahil sa pagiging tanga. sa oras na lumabas ang mga salita sa bibig ko ay may isa na namang mensahe ang dumating sa cell phone. kinuha ko iyon at sinubukang i-unlock, pero 'yung regular home screen ay hindi lumalabas. ang lumabas lang ay isang white screen na may maikling text. putang ina. ang mga babae dapat hindi ginagamit ng ganung mga uri ng salita. matapos kong mabasa 'yun ay nawala na ito sa screen at may panibagong text ang lumabas. bakit hindi ka lumabas at makipag-laro? huwag mo ng isiping bitbitin pa 'yang kutsilyong hawak mo. wala ring magagawa 'yan sa hawak kong baril. tinapon ko ang cell phone ko sa lapag at agad-agad ay nagtungo ako sa aking computer. ang tunog ay mas lalong lumakas habang papalapit ako sa aking lamesa, doon ay nakita kong may isang baboy na stuffed toy. may fabric button ito sa bandang paanan at music note na kasama. dito nagmumula ang tunog at nagpapatunay lamang na hindi ako mag-isa at may kung sino akong kasama. ang malala pa, pinapanood nila ang bawat galaw ko at sinusubukang takutin gamit ang mga laruang pambata. unti-unti ng dumadaloy ang pagpapanic sa aking buong katawan at naghahanda na sa fight or flight scenario. huminga ako ng malalim, sinusubukan kong pakalmahin ang buong katawan ko. so far wala pa naman akong naririnig ng kahit anong palatandaan na may ibang tao sa loob ng office. may mga background noises galing sa syudad sa labas at ang mga ingay mula sa naka-limutang patayin na computer ng isang employee. kung sino man ang gumagawa nito sa akin, kailangan kong malaman ang kanilang eksaktong lokasyon para maplano ko ng maayos ang pag-takas ko. isa pa, kailangan kong maka-kuha ng tulong sa lalong mas madaling panahon. habang iginigilid ko ang laruan ay umupo na ako sa aking upuan at pinull-up ang skype for business application. mabilis akong nag-dial ng 911, habang naka-loudspeaker ang telepono. tumunog na nga ang dial tone at agad-agad ay may live operator na sa kabilang linya. ibibigay ko na sana ang mga hindi kanais-nais na pangyayari sa akin ng mga oras na iyon ng may biglang humawak sa bukong-bukong ko mula sa ilalim ng lamesa. halos maubos ang buong lakas ko sa pagsigaw habang nagpu-pumiglas ang mga paa at mabilis na tumakbo sa abot ng aking makakaya sa bilis na hindi ko akaling kaya ko. may narinig akong kung anong kumusyon sa aking likuran habang tumakbo, kasunod ng isang malakas ng putok, na inisip ko na lamang na galing sa kung ano o sino man ang humahabol sa akin. bago ko pa malaman ay halos nasa ground floor na ako papunta sa pinto lagpas sa gwardiya na halatang nagulat sa mga nangyayari. ang malamig na hangin ay mabilis na pumasok sa manipis kong sweater habang papalapit ako sa isang malapit na pedestrian para humingi ng tulong. tumawag sila ng 911 at ang mga pulis ay agad namang dumating wala pang sampung minuto. habang naghihintay ako kasama ang gwardiya para sa kanilang pag-dating, hindi maalis sa isip ko ang sinulat ni jennah na warning, at kung gaano ako ka-tanga para ipagsa walang bahala ang mga ito. - i-check ang ang bawat aisle, meeting room. huwag kalimutang i-check ang ilalim ng lamesa, balkonahe, kitchen tables at kahit likod ng cooler. agad-agad namang sinulat ng pulis ang mga nangyari sa akin at iniwan ako kasama ang isang pulis officer, umakyat s'ya para i-check ang office. wala namang naka-labas-masok sa building mula nung tumakbo ako palabas, kaya malaki ang posibilidad na naroroon pa rin ang salarin at nagtatago sa loob. sa pag-iisip ay halos bumaliktad ang buong sikmura ko at mas lalo akong lumapit sa may armas kong kasama. maya-maya pa matapos kaming iwanan ng mga pulis, ang kasama kong pulis ay nag-radyo at isa-isa may mga boses na nagpapa-palit-palit sa radyo na humingi ng backup at nga mga codes na hindi ko maintindihan. mabilis na nag-escalate ang mga sumunod na pangyayari. imbis na pauwi ay dinala nila ako sa police station at doon ay nanatili ako sa isang interrogation room ng halos 2 oras bago pa sa wakas may dalawang pulis officer ang kumausap sa akin. pagod na ako noon, miserable ang kalagayan at higit sa lahat litong-lito sa kung papaano naganap ang mga pangyayari. gusto ko ng umuwi pero nanatili pa ako ng ilang oras para i-kuwento ang mga pangyayari sa dalawang pulis officer. 'ahh... meron kang kutsilyong hawak habang tumakbo ka galing sa pantry papunta sa lamesa mo? sigurado ka ba?' tanong ng isang nakaka-tandang officer na nagpakilala bilang senior investigator manlapig. 'ah. ah... oo.' pautal-utal kong sagot sa kanya. 'naniniwala akong meron. nag-papanic na ako noon, kaya mahirap sabihin. tapos may baboy na stuffed toy, ' sabi ko, habang tila baga'y nawawalan ako ng abilidad na mag-isip ng tama. 'at naniniwala ka na ang taong humaharass sa'yo ay si michael villareal?' sabi ng isa pang officer, hindi ko maalala 'yung pangalan n'ya. wala s'yang badge. 'hindi ko alam buong pangalan n'ya, pero wala na akong ibang kilala na iba pang responsable.' 'at sa huling pagkakataon, just for the record, anong nangyari matapos mong mag-dial ng 911?' tanong ni manlapig sa ika-apat na pagkakataon sa gabing 'yun. 'may kung sino ang humawak sa binti ko. bukong-bukong, actually. nangyari 'yun bago pa ako magkaroon ng pagkakataong ipaliwanag ang sitwasyon sa operator. nagsusumigaw at piglas ang mga paa ko tapos tumakbo hanggang may makita akong tao sa labas na pina-tawag ako sa 911 para sa tulong.' sagot ko, habang pagod na pagod sa paulit-ulit at paikot-ikot na pagtatanong. 'si michael villareal ay natagpuang patay sa hindi kalayuan ng iyong lamesa nung pumunta ang officer namin sa pinang-yarihan ng insidente. nakita mo ba ang kanyang katawan nung tumakbo ka palabas ng office?' tanong ng isang officer. halos malaglag ang panga ko sa mga narinig ko at tumitig sa dalawang pulis habang balisa at nanginginig sa takot. 'hi.. hi.. hindi,' pabulong akong nag-salita, 'hindi ko maintindihan,' 'sinaksak s'ya hanggang sa mamatay gamit ang malaking kutsilyo. ang katawan n'ya ay balot ng dalawampu't-tatlong saksak,' paliwanag ni manlapig. 'at nakita namin ang kutsilyo ay nakabaon sa bibig nito, dahilan para dumikit ito sa sahig diretcho sa lalamunan,' 'may rason kami para pagsuspetyahan na ito rin ang sinasabi mong kutsilyo,' dagdag pa ng pangalawang officer. nakatitig ako sa dalawang pulis officer ng tahimik, hirap akong intindihin ang mga pangyayari lalo na't ang utak ko ay halos mawala na sa ulirat. 'ang mga sinabi mo ay nagpapatunay lamang sa mga natagpuaan namin sa cell phone ni michael villareal. nalaman namin na may roon siyang hacking apps,' pagpapatuloy ng senior officer. 'natagpuan din naman ang ilan mo pang mga hubong larawan at ang mga mensahe na iyong nabanggit. mayroon s'yang baril at nakita rin naman ang basyo ng bala nung binaril ka n'ya habang papatakas ka.' 'ang hindi namin maintindihan ay kung papaano s'ya namatay.' dagdag pa ng pangalawang officer, halatang hindi s'ya naniniwala sa aking reaksyon. 'ok lang kung napatay mo s'ya dahil sa self-defense, aya. may balak s'yang masama sa'yo.' 'hindi,' pautal-utal kong sagot. 'pangako, wala akong ideya... oh, oh my god.' naiyak na ako dahil sa mga nangyayari. 'ibig kong sabihin, nung nakaraang buwan lang may nag-report sa kanya galing sa isa n'yang co-worker,' sabi ni manlapig. 'jennah,' bulong ko. 'kilala mo si miss espiritu?' tanong ng pangalawang officer, at ng suspetya sa kanyang mga mats. 'hindi,' ako ang pumalit sa lamesa n'ya at nakuha ko ang notebook n'ya. dapat sinabi ko na 'to kanina pa. anong sabi sa report? doon nga ay nagtitigan ang dalawang pulis at maka-lipas ang ilang sandali ay inilatag at ipinaliwanag ni manlapig ang mga hindi magandang nangyari kay jennah na halos mangyari na sa akin. si jennah espiritu ay dumiretcho sa pinaka-malapit na hospital mula sa kanyang unang night shift tatlong buwan na ang nakakaraan. sobrang bugbog ng katawan n'ya at sugatan, at gustong mag-file ng anonymous rape kit. ang natanong damage n'ya sa kanyang puwerta ay sobrang severe na kinailangan n'yang sumailalim sa operasyon at magpatahi. nag-file s'ya ng police report makalipas ang dalawang buwan matapos s'yang hindi pumasa sa probationary period sa inyong kumpanya, ng nawala s'ya sa trabaho (ang nagiisang paraan para mabayaran ang kanyang utang sa hospital). ang nangyari ay ang kanyang aligasyon kontra kay michael villareal, na gumastos s'ya ng malaki sama mo pa ang hindi mabilang na kanyang mga co-workers na kumontra sa kanya laban sa magalang at kaaya-ayang katangian ni michael. 'pero kahapon lang ay iniurong na n'ya lahat ng mga isinampa n'yang kaso kay michael,' sabi ng walang badge na pulis. 'kasalukuyan naming inaalam ang kinaroroonan ni espiritu para ma-interview namin s'ya. sigurado ako na ngayon malinaw na kung bakit may suspetya kami sa iyo bilang nakikilala mo espiritu.' nagpatuloy ang mga tanong ng dalawang pulis hanggang may isang lalaki na nag-abot sa kanya ng isang sobre. natukoy na ng forensics ang fingerprint na nakita sa kutsilyo at ang blood-spatter patterns. kinailangan ko ring mag-submit ng dna samples para maka-tulong sa imbestigasyon at sa wakas ay pina-uwi na nila ako. sa bahay, dahil sa sobrang pagod, hindi ako maka-tulog. wala akong gamit na naiuwi. bag, cell phone at kahit ang jacket ko ay kinailangan i-submit bilang ebidensya. kaya naman napilitan akong gamitin ang luma kong laptop, umaasa na malibang sa internet. ang browser ko ay naka-login pa rin sa linkedin account ko mula sa nakaraang login, at nirefreshed ko ang page bilang naka-sanayan. isang maliit na red icon ang lumitaw na mayroon akong bagong mensahe. jennah. nagre-reply na s'ya sa akin. don't worry, sis. i took care of it. ❤️",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/t77k69/tagalized_story/,5 03 2022

"Naniniwala ba kayo sa mga maligno, engkanto, kaluluwa, atbp.","i had this experience recently. around 9 pm na ako nakarating mula sa amin sa cubao to our subdivision kung saan ako nagboboarding sa san jose city, nueva ecija ,(doon kasi ako nag-aaral sa clsu) then sa isang street may isang bahay na tinatayo pa lang na sobrang madilim dahil walang ilaw. as i passed the house, may narinig ako na umiiyak, in-ignore ko lang kasi baka nga may sanggol talaga doon. after few meters, may puno at grassy part, iba naman ang naririnig ko, tumatawa naman. medyo creepy at tumindig talaga ang balahibo ko. tapos pag dating ko sa boarding, wala yung caretaker sa kabila at yung ilaw sa cr ay patay-sindi. then after few days umuwi na ako samin sa qc. sa 5th floor kami nakatira, sumakay ako sa elevator, mag-isa lang ako. pinindot ko ang number 5. after few seconds, umilaw ang 4. hindi ko naman pinindot. nang tumapat na sa 4th floor, bumakas ang elevator pero walang pumasok, pero may narinig ako na tumatawa. inignore ko na lang. baka kako may batang nagpindot sa labas ng floor. pero imposible e. sa loob umilaw. then nito lang ay nagkasakit ako, ilang araw din na masama ang pakiramdam ko. nagbakasakali ako na baka connected to sa experience ko nung nakaraan. ilang beses na rin kasi ako nagkasakit dahil mga ""hindi nakikita"" na yan. since bata pa ako madalas may ganyan nang karanasan. sabi ko sa nanay ko na ipatawas ako (nasa laguna siya). ayon sa tawas, may babaeng kaluluwa daw na nagkakagusto sa akin. sa puno nakatira. lagi raw nakasunod sa akin at inaadvise-an ako nung nagtawas na magsuot palagi ng pula. nakita rin niya sa tawas na nakadagan sakin yung multo. sobrang creepy talaga. may isa rin akong nakilala na student na doon din nagdodorm sa subdivision na yon. lalaking maligno naman ang nagkakagusto sa kanya. ilang araw din nagkasakit yon. i know na hindi para sa lahat ang story na to. kahit ako dati e. di naman naniniwala. di naman pwedeng mamilit. hehe sa mga naniniwala. may mga similar experiences ba kayo?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ypbv38/naniniwala_ba_kayo_sa_mga_maligno_engkanto/,8 11 2022

Do you remember the late great Haydee Yorac?,"ito si haydee yorac. kilala siya ng iilan. sayang, dahil ang galing niya bilang abogado at integridad bilang lingkod bayan ay dapat alam ng mas marami. haydee yorac. matigas. matatag. top 8 sa bar exams ng 1962. human rights lawyer at bantog na kritiko ng martial law regime ni haydee. ikinulong siya ng militar nang tatlong (3) buwan pero nanatili pa rin si haydee sa adbokasiya niya sa tulong ng flag o ng free legal assistance group na inorganisa ng nasirang senador ka pepe diokno. si haydee ay assistant vice president ng up diliman at isa ring law professor. pagkatapos ng edsa 1, itinalaga si haydee sa comelec, at ipinakita niya bilang isang commissioner na wala siyang kinatatakutan, kahit na ang mga “warlords” sa mindanao. inayos ni haydee ang mga magugulong eleksyon sa malalayong lugar ng bansa. walang pagod niyang itinuloy ang misyon niyang magkaroon ng malinis na eleksyon. dahil dito, kinilala at iginagalang si haydee ng kanyang mga katrabaho, gayundin ng mga pulitikong kanyang nakakasagupa. commissioner siya sa comelec mula 1986 hanggang 1991, at naging hepe ng comelec noong 1989. walang bahid. ni isa. kinikilala ang katapatan ng comelec, hanggang ito ay nabahiran ng “hello garci” scandal ng 2004 – kung kailan matagal nang wala sa comelec si haydee. itinalaga si haydee sa national unification commission noong 1992 kung saan dinadalayogo ang mga militanteng grupo sa bansa para makipayapa na. dahil sa kanyang mga unang pag-aaral at pananaliksik, nabuo ang istilo ng mga prosesong pangkapayapaan. kinatatakutan si haydee dahil sa kanyang walang sawang paghahanap sa katotohanan, ngunit minamahal dahil sa kanyang sense of humor, mainit na pagtanggap sa iba, at sa kanyang malalim na malasakit sa mga hindi makakuha ng hustisya. noong 1998, tumakbo sa senado si haydee pero natalo sa mga sikat na pangalang tito sotto, ramon revilla sr. at robert jaworski. ngunit ang kanyang pinakamaningning na mga panahon bilang lingkodbayan ay dumating noong 2001 – itinalaga si haydee na commissioner ng pcgg (philippine commission on good governance). nag-recruit siya ng mga dating empleyado ng up, mga bata at aktibong mga abogado para magsilbi sa pcgg, at siniguro at inipon ang mga records ng litigasyon. sa ilalim ng pamunuan ni haydee sa pcgg ay naibalik sa gobyerno ang $683 milyon mula sa mga marcos swiss bank accounts. siya din ang tumulong mabawi ang mga coconut levy funds, nang maipanalo ang kaso sa korte suprema laban sa marcos crony na si danding cojuangco, kung saan isinauli ang mga pera sa 3.4 milyong magsasaka noong martial law. nagretiro siya sa pcgg nang siya ay magka-kanser noong 2005. pumanaw siya ilang buwan ang nakalipas. sa pambihirang pagkakataon, nagsama-sama mula sa iba’t ibang partido ang mga miyembro ng senado para ibotong ilibing si haydee sa libingan ng mga bayani. ito ay marapat lamang na gantimpala. hindi siya isang pekeng bayani. ayon nga kay shiela coronel ng columbia university, “may utak siyang klarong-klaro dahil hindi nagugulo ng ambisyon, o ng uhaw sa pera o kapangyarihan. ito ay isip na may kalayaan dahil hindi nakakabit sa personal, pulitikal, or ideyolohikal na agenda.” haydee yorac. tandaan ang pangalan. walang kinakatakutan. hindi takot kay marcos. hindi takot sa warlords. hindi takot sa cronies. nasaan na ba ang mga matatapang na haydee yorac? napatahimik na ba?",https://i.redd.it/v3vb7np8wyha1.jpg,13 02 2023

Dookki Gateway Mall 2 branch - From bad food experience to Gateway Admin Office to Barangay Hall!,"&#x200b; pa rant lang po, d lang talaga fair sa kung paano na handle ng dookki yung situation at kung san pa kami dinala at napunta. specifically gateway mall 2 branch. franchise daw sila, meaning iba iba may ari ng dookki, hindi iisa, so baka dito lang sa branch na to panget yung food and service. d ko nilalahat yung dookki, eto lang talagang branch na to. hays. &#x200b; p.s. pwede ba ako mag post ng honest food review sa fb ng hindi ako hahabulin ng dookii legally? thank you sa mga sasagot! &#x200b; warning: long post :( may short at long version po, pili na lang kayo kung ano pasok sa time nyo huhu. \------------------ short version (yes short na talaga yan eh) \-------------------- \-brought my parents sa recently opened dookki korean buffet. we were 3. \- ""kumain"" ng 5-10 minutes. wala nga kaming naubos na isang buong kahit ano. \-nagreklamo kasi malamig food, wala lasa pagkain, at may mga langaw. \- imbes na mahanapan ng resolution na both parties agreed to, manager and owner(whom he talked to on the phone) decided to call guards and bring us to gateway admin office instead without informing us. nagmuka kaming eat and run. d nga kami lumabas mismo ng buffet. sumama si manager. \- dun sa admin office, after they heard both sides, manager offered a resolution. wala pa daw sagot si owner sa phone, pero 1 person na lang daw bayaran. sagot na lang daw nya yung 2 na tao. then we agreed. \- after going out for a while, returned and retracted his resolution. d daw pumayag owner. ano kaya yun. pwde naman nya d na lang sabihin sa owner na kami yung nagbayad sa part na sasagutin nya kung genuine sya sa sinabi nya before dba. eh ayun d nagkasundo ulit. was escorted next to barangay hall. \- after barangay heard both sides, they fairly judged that to make both parties happy, we should at least pay half. the bill was 550 each, total of 1650 for 3. so mga 800 na lang babayran namin. \- but owner (manager called again) decided to sue us, kasuhan na lang daw kami. mas gusto ni owner magsampa ng kaso na pwede mas malaki pa ilalabas nyang pera sa lawyer, sa papers, etc. , instead of giving any discount. \-barangay knows that this case was too small and too hassle, and nakakahiya na iakyat pa yung ganitong klaseng kaso sa isang gov. agency (3 letters d ko na matandaan) kasi maliit na bagay lang. \-barangay offered to shoulder half of the payment (800), wag na lang daw ituloy yung kaso. kasi yun nga una, nakakahiya daw, pangalawa, hassle rin kasi maliit na bagay pwede pag usapan. \- pumayag kami para lang matapos na. 3-4 hours lumipas , tapos parents ko at ako gutom pa rin. kaya nga dapat d kami pumayag na maglabas ng kahit magkano eh. tsaka magmumuka kaming hindi cooperative kung inayawan pa namin yung half half na settlement. ending: \- owner gets the full amount and wins (ayaw talaga kasi asikasuhin ng barangay kasi nakakahiya at hassle talaga para sa maliit na bagay mag sampa ng kaso sa gantong amount and klase.) \-nawalan 800 pesos kasi d naman kami kumain talaga. \- gutom pa rin kami pagkatapos -\_\_- &#x200b; &#x200b; \------------------------------------ long version \-------------------------------- bagong bukas yung dooki korean buffet dun sa bagong gateway, so nag plan ako dalin parents ko dun para ma experience namin, we haven't tried any other branches yet. pumunta kami ng mga bandang 1-2pm. nung pakuha na ako ng sarili kong food, may langaw sa maki/sushi, pero d ko na lang pinansin binugaw ko na lang. so eto yung mga reklamo ko sa food by order of consumption: &#x200b; sushi/maki \- cold, below room temperature, hindi lang yung hindi mainit, malamig talaga. \- matigas yung kanin parang lumang kanin or parang yung sa bahay lang galing na d maganda pagkakasaing. sabi ko baka makabawi sa chicken... \- malamig rin. mas malapit sa matigas kesa sa malambot. &#x200b; parang nawawalan na ako ng gana. sana masarap naman tong chapchae nila.. \- malamig \- walang lasa, literal walang asin or kahit anong flavor akong matikan, noodles na malamig lang. (mas may lasa pa yung chapchae ng bon chon) &#x200b; tinanong ko parents ko naman kung nag eenjoy ba sila baka ako lang kasi maarte. ayun sabi rin nila hindi masarap food. &#x200b; so mga 10 min lang kami kumain sa table, hindi kasama yung time na paghahanap ng food na mga 10-15 minutes. parang wala na rin kasi mapili masyadong food eh. konti lang compared sa ibang buffet, parang d sya considered na buffet sakin. mali ko lang d muna ako umikot sa food, kasi inassume ko na pag buffet marami talaga pagpipilian. so kesa makahanap pa kami ng ibang food para makabawi dun sa mga malalamig na food, wala na masyado pagpipilian talaga. so ayun, kesa sa pilitin namin na ienjoy yung food kahit d naman talaga, nag decide na ako magreklamo, and sana full refund, kasi parang yung kinain naman mga worth 100 lang, tapos yung food na d nagalaw nasa tancha ko mga 200-300 pesos lang. pero okay na rin ako sakali kung d pumayag, kahit 1 person na lang bayararan namin. ayun eto na mga ganap. &#x200b; sabi ko sa parents ko wag na sila kumain, then called a manager. we expressed our concerns, na saglit pa lang kami kumakain, na malamig pagkain, etc. umalis saglit, d ko alam san nagpunta. tapos bumalik, sabi nya bawi na lang daw sila next time. ano yun? panong bawi eh ano gagastos ulit kami diun eh ayaw na nga namin kumain ulit dun. tapos pagbabayarin pa kami dun sa kinain naming kokonti? ano kaya yun. sabi ko hindi naman pwede ganun lang. ayun umalis ulit. nung bumalik samin, yung leftover daw d na daw ichacharge samin (meaning neto need pa rin namin mag pay ng full amount.) eh magkano lang yung charge na yun 250, tsaka babayaran mo lang talag yun kung may tira eh. eh mismong yung pagkain nga d namin gusto kaya naging tira. ayun umalis ulit. kung iisipin, pwede naman ding ang ginawa nya is mag sorry at mag offer ng new food na mainit, pero hindi eh. eto sana pwede nyang sinuggest samin nung una pa lang, kaso mainit na ulo ko nung time na yun kasi d maayos pagkakahandle nung manager, tsaka late ko na naisip, nung nasa barangay hall na kami. oops lumaktaw na ako haha, balik ako sa kwento. bumalik samin, nag spill ng script si manager! halata na medyo kinakabahan, tapos scripted yung sinasabi nya. na parang wala silang magagawa ganun chu chu pero sa english syempre. eh alam naman nila na kakapasok lang rin namin. bakit d magawan ng paraan to? ayun biglang umalis sa kalagitnaan ng script nya, baka may tumawag sa kanya sa labas. so ayun, napansin na namin kaya pala sya umaalis is para tawagan yung boss nya, which is yung mismong owner nung franchise. i learned na franchise lang sila, at hindi iisang big food company, which means hindi iisa may ari, iba iba per franchise. i learned this nung nasa barangay hall na lang rin. &#x200b; nagantay kami ng mga 20-30 min, pero wala pa ring sagot pa daw si owner. we suggested to pay at least for 1 person for 550 kahit sa totoo lang hindi aabot ng 200 pesos yung dinala naming food sa table. ang tagal kasi gawan ng paraan naiininip na kami, d naman namin pwede galawin yung pagkain kasi nga syempre nagrereklamo kami sa food. nakatunganga na lang kami bale. ang tagal talaga eh. so ayun sasabihin daw nya sa owner kung pwedeng 1 person na lang bayaran. &#x200b; may napansin mom ko sa buffet, ang daming langaw. sabi ko sa kanya picturan nya in case, kung ayaw nilang pumayag magparefund, pakita na lang natin na may mga langaw food nila. which is totoo naman. kaso nung kukuha na ng picture mom ko, nagsialisan, kaya wala tuloy kaming kuha. ang kuha ko lang is may video ng 1-2 langaw, pero nasa table lang, d ko lang alam kung pwede magamit sa kanila yun in any case, kung counted pa rin ganun. &#x200b; so nag antay ulit kami. maya maya, napapansin ko na may mga guard na sa labas ng dookki. weird lang kasi medyo marami, mga 3-5? tapos d lang sa iisang lugar, parang nakakalat sila sa labas. d ko na lang muna pinansin. pero maya maya pinuntahan nakami tapos dinala kami sa mga guard, tsaka lang nya sinabi na sa admin office ng gateway na lang daw namin i settle yung problema. eh para samin, bakit pa idadamay mismong gateway kung kaya naman pag usapan to within the 2 parties? ang lala naman ng ganun, nagmuka tuloy kaming eat and run. d bale kung naka eat nga eh. tsaka kung nag run, mismong d nga kami lumabas ng buffet. sino ba d maiinis? yung pwede pag usapan, pinalala pa at dinamay yung gateway? d ko magets ano nangyayare. ayun, dinala na kami sa admin office, kasama yung manager. &#x200b; pagdating dun sa office, nag explain kami ng sides dun sa admin. may iba ring tao, mga security ata mga 3-4 sila. sinabi lang rin namin ulit yung reklamo dun sa food ng buffet, at wala kami masyado nakain, etc. sinabi namin dinala na lang kami dito ng d namin alam, na ayun nga d pa nga namin alam feedback ni owner dun sa offer naming payment na 1 na tao. sino ba d maiinis sa ganung outcome eh. maya maya, pagkatapos mag explain both sides, si manager wala pa ring sariling desisyon, labas ulit ng office para tawagan si owner. &#x200b; after a while, bumalik sya, sabi nya wala pa raw reply, pero sasagutin na lang daw nya yung 2 persons para lang matapos yung issue. &#x200b; edi ayun ""dapat"" tapos na yung issue, nagsalita na kasi sya eh. pumayag na kami, 550 yung babayaran. wala akong barya, binigay ko 1k. balik na lang daw sya sa dookki para suklian at bigyan kami ng resibo. narinig lahat ng tao dun sa kwarto pati admin at security sa usapan. &#x200b; ayan happy mood na ulit ako kasi tapos na yung problema eh. nakipag kwentuhan na rin kina admin, etc. mabait rin sila kahit mukang nakakatakot, kasi security iba dun eh, nakakaintimidate lang, share lang. so lumipas 20 minutes, ayan nakabalik na rin sya sa wakas. kaso nung pagpasok, parang 1k pa rin hawak nya. ayan na nga. sabi samin, d daw pumayag si owner na sya magbayad, dapat daw kami... kung nasa kanya naman daw, walang problema sagutin nya yung 2 na tao. &#x200b; ahm... eh kung d na lang nya sinabi sa owner na sya yung magbabayad at sinabing kami yung nagbayad para tapos na? parang d naman naging valid at genuine yung pagiging makatao nya sa rason nya. kung nasa kanya? eh kung nasa kanya naman pala, eh di di na lang nya sana sinabi na sya magbabayad, para matapos na. so ano? ang hipokrito naman nun. lumalabas na insincere syang tao. gusto nya lang lumabas na genuine sya, pero d naman siguro halata na nagbago lang isip nya? may nakausap siguro pagbalik nya sa dookki, kaya nagbago isip. &#x200b; eto, d na ulit nagkasundo, sabi ni admin, dalin na daw eto sa barangay. ayun na nga. daming eme. &#x200b; sabi namin sige, ganun lang rin naman mangyayari ulit, kung ano nangyare ngayon. &#x200b; ganun pa rin ganap, pagdating sa barangay hall ng cubao, nag explain both sides. pero ang pinagkaiba lang sa side nila, meron silang picture na nung pagkain namin, na before wala. pinapamuka nila na kung d naman daw kami nag enjoy bakit andaming food sa table. eh malamang kinuha yun nung una pa lang. d naman ibig sabihin nun nag enjoy na agad. tapos kwento 30-40 minutes daw kami nandun, kasi may timer daw yung induction stove nila dun sa ginamit namin dun sa soup. nag- iba na panig nila, pinapalabas na nila na kumain kami tapos gusto naming tumakbo. hay kaloka. &#x200b; nakakapagod mag kwento ang haba, pero patapos na. &#x200b; paigsiin ko na kasi paulit ulit na yung iba dun sa sinabi namin sa admin office. so ayun, nag intervene ang barangay. para walang away daw, kalahti na lang bayaran namin. pero sinabi namin sa barangay , kahit anong discount ayaw naman bigay ng dookki. tinanong nila ulit si manager para matapos na, ayun. labas ulit. call owner. bumalik. ayaw pa rin daw ng owner. magsasampa na lang daw sila ng kaso... &#x200b; sabi namin sige lang, magsampa kayo ng kaso. alam kasi ni dad na mas mahal pa magagastos nila sa lawyer at sa iba pa, para lang asikasuhin yung kaso para sa 1650, kaya d rin kami natatakot, tsaka sincere naman talaga kami sa reklamo namin, d naman kami eat and run. ayun, medyo nasisiraan na rin ng ulo mga barangay sa side ng dookkii, kasi d man lang mag adjust kahit konti. &#x200b; pero kung gusto daw talaga nila magsampa ng kaso, need daw nila ng spa. si manager daw mag aasikaso nun. by that time, medyo halata na napapagod na si manager, kasi d sya makakilos, wala syang sariling desisyon, tapos d nya na alam gagawin pagdating sa mga legal stuff. eh wala eh sabi sa kanya ng owner nya na magsampa, so wala syang choice talaga. &#x200b; pero sa totoo lang, ayaw rin ipatuloy ng barangay yung kaso, kasi nakakahiya daw i escalate pa daw to dun sa gov ageny na nabanggit, 3 letters yun d ko na maalala sorry d talaga familiar sakin, parang ngayon ko lang narinig. nakakahiya daw kasi maliit na bagay lang tsaka maliit na halaga, na kaya naman daw pag usapan, pero pinaabot pa sa kaso. tingin ko rin medyo may hassle rin sa side nila, d ko lang alam ano mga gagawin nila talaga. masasabihan rin siguro sila na simpleng issue d nila maayos, kaya ayun ayaw nila magkaron ng record. &#x200b; so kesa daw ituloy yung kaso, sabi ng barangay, sagot na daw nila yung kalahati. bayaran na lang daw namin yung 800. &#x200b; para sakin lang, d dapat kami pumayag kasi sa dulo kami panalo eh, kasi mangyayare d rin matutuloy kaso kasi una, oras na magagamit nila, pangalwa, yung gastos nilan sa lawyer, etc. . para magdemanda ng 1650 pesos. &#x200b; pero ayun pumayag na lang rin kami sa half. para tapos na. pumayag kami kasi: \- magaling magsalita yung barangay, persuasive, people person, kaya mapapaoo ka na talaga \- pag kumontra pa kami dun, lalabas lang rin na ayaw rin namin makipag cooperate \- ayoko na rin ma stress parents ko. &#x200b; so ano nangyare sa huli \- nakuha nila full amount, 800 samin, 800 galing barangay \- gumastos ng 800 para sa food worth 100-200 \- at pinaka nakakainis sa lahat, gutom. pa rin. kami. &#x200b; so kumain na lang kami sa iba. so gastos is 800 + 500 = 1300 para sa simpleng pagkain lang. &#x200b; ayun salamat sa pakikinig. nakakainis lang talaga eh. pera is pera. may right naman tayo umayaw sa food kung d naman talaga masarap, at alam mo sa sarili mo na d ka umabuso. &#x200b; &#x200b; &#x200b; &#x200b; &#x200b; &#x200b; &#x200b; &#x200b; &#x200b; &#x200b;",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/17iomjd/dookki_gateway_mall_2_branch_from_bad_food/,28 10 2023

&nbsp; paglilinaw: ang hindrance sa ating progress na humihila sa'tin pababa ay hindi ang criticism o pagpuna sa'ting government officials, kundi ang ating intolerance at galit sa criticism. maganda ang sinabi sa [article na ito](https://www.manilatimes.net/2020/03/19/opinion/columnists/topanalysis/criticizing-as-a-form-of-civic-duty/704176). habang hindi naman tayo gumagawa ng threats o nagdudulot ng harm sa'ting kapuwa, walang masama sa pag-express ng frustrations o konting humor sa mga mali sa ating lipunan at gobyerno. mas ok pa rin yung aware tayo kesa magpikit mata tayo na parang mas mahal na natin ang isang public servant kaysa sa bayan. balansihin din natin. hindi ito pagrebelde o pakikipaglaban sa gobyerno, kundi pag-call out ng inefficiencies at incompetence, at pagsuporta na rin sa checks and balances ng ating lipunan para hindi maabuso ang kapangyarihan. at hindi komo nagrereklamo, hindi ibig sabihin wala tayong ibang ginagawa. si leni nga andaming reklamo ng lugaw na yan, pero halos araw-araw ring nagtrabaho simula day 1. ang gusto lang namin kay leni, kahit kailan hindi siya pagalit mag-voice out ng criticism at malumanay siyang nagbibigay ng suggestions for improvement. kaya marami rin ang akala ay mahina at walang political will si leni kasi malumanay siya. pero hindi siya mahina kundi matapang. isipin mo, presidente na mismo ang pinupuna niya, kahit alam niya ang negative effect sa image at popularity niya dahil alam naman niya ang kultura nating mga pinoy na napaka-allergic sa criticism. kita naman natin ang backlash sa facebook posts niya na flooded ng laugh reacts at toxic comments. pero bakit ba talaga si leni nagvo-voice out? ramdam niya ang mga hinanakit ng taong bayan kasi andun siya mismo parati sa ground at may kamalayan siya sa kalagayan ng mga tao. like yung pag-una pa sa dolomite sand, sabi niya ito raw ay [insensitive](https://mb.com.ph/2020/09/08/manila-bay-white-beach-an-insensitive-plan-in-time-of-pandemic-solon/) kasi magbuhos sana dapat muna ng lahat ng resources at attention sa pandemic, which is a valid point 'di ba? dahil alam niyang kapag mas mabilis maka-return to normal ang labor force natin, mas mabilis aangat muli ang ekonomiya natin. &nbsp; ##2. puppet si leni ng oligarchs! &nbsp; paglilinaw: unlike sa panahon ni cory na may injustices laban sa mga magsasaka, kahit bago pa si leni tumakbo for any public office, no political plans or agenda, bilang lawyer ay mahusay niyang ipinagtanggol na pro bono (walang bayad) ang maraming marginalized sectors. halimbawa ay ang paglaban niya para sa mga lupa ng sumilao farmers against sa conglomerate by the name of san miguel corporation. naipanalo nila ang kaso laban sa mga elite. kaya hindi nakakapagtaka kung bakit todo ang suporta sa kaniya ng mga [sumilao farmers](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/779322/sumilao-farmers-to-march-not-for-land-but-for-robredo). iba iba rin ang ugali ng individual na members ng mga partido, hindi lahat masama o lahat mabuti. halimbawa, sina cory at duterte ay parehas na kabilang sa pdp-laban, na sinimulan naman ni ninoy. kakapalit lang din ni sara recently. makikita rin natin sa saln ni leni na hindi siya kasing yaman ng most politicians, kaya noong sinampahan siya ng kaso ni bbm, may volunteers na nagbuo ng [crowdfunding campaign](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/803171/piso-para-kay-leni) to support her legal fees. anong ginawa niya? at her own personal risk, she politely declined to avoid graft at ipinamahagi lahat ng funds sa angat buhay program, especially sa housing projects sa marawi. see [here](https://gogetfunding.com/piso-para-sa-laban-ni-leni/) for more details. also search for ""jeanette concepcion patindol piso para kay leni"" on facebook. this speaks volumes about her integrity. isa pa, her office consistently received the highest audit rating from coa for [3 straight years](https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2021/6/29/ovp-highest-audit-rating-coa-third-straight-year-.html). ilang beses na tayong umasa sa mga napakagandang pangako ng mga politiko, so it might help if i-apply natin ito sa **lahat** ng ating candidates: kahit gaano kaganda ang mga pangako, plano, at plataporma ng kahit sinong candidate, kahit gaano kagaling siyang magsalita, ka-inspiring ang kaniyang vision, at katindi ng kaniyang political will, ang mas reliable indicator ng kanilang totoong character ay hindi ang kanilang words, hindi rin ang words para sa kanila ng naging allies nila or ng sikat na vloggers or influencers, kundi ang kanilang **past actions**. she takes quick actions. at ang lahat ng ginawa niya bilang vp ay **initiatives** lang niya o kusang loob—hindi part ng mandates ng ovp—dahil siya ay isang servant leader. &nbsp; ##3. history is written by the victors! &nbsp; *""napakarami namang infrastructures ang ginawa noon. binenta ng mga dilawan ang mga pagmamayari ng bayan!""* paglilinaw: ang ""history is written by the victors"" and ""corrupt naman lahat, at least may nagawa"" ay tinatawag na fallacious generalizations o mga logical fallacy dahil sa insufficient evidence at overreliance on observations o panlabas na nakikita. kailangan natin makita ang bigger picture para malinawan tayo. graduate ako ng economics sa up kaya kahit nasa 30s na ako at nakalimutan ko na most of my lectures on development economics, kahit papaano ay may kamalayan pa rin ako at paggamit ng critical thinking para ma-separate kung ano ang propaganda at hindi, at kung ano ang nangyari sa ekonomiya natin. oo, napakaraming ginawang infrastructures. walang mali dito kung careful at proper ang pag-spend. ang problema ay maraming cases ng overspending dahil sa cronies at mga rushed projects. read more [here](https://newslab.philstar.com/31-years-of-amnesia/building-spree). meron namang magagandang projects gaya ng san juanico bridge, philippine heart center, lung center of the philippines, dams, at napakarami pang iba. 2 dekada ba naman e. kaya lang napakalaking spending din sa failed investments gaya ng controversial bataan nuclear power plant na ang cost sana sa contract ay $0.65 billion pero biglang naging $2.2 billion. read [here](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2017/ph241/camacho2/). ang malala pa ay ang napakalaking ginastos din sa tinatawag na edifices para magmukhang may progress pero in the long run ay hindi masyadong nakatulong sa ating economic growth gaya ng ccp at manila film center. ang problema, ito ay debt-driven o puro galing sa utang sa world bank. mula around $0.6 billion utang bago maluklok si marcos, naging $26.7b pagkatapos. read [here](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/774774/well-pay-marcos-debt-until-2025). paano natin malalaman kung **overall** ay maganda ang investments natin sa infrastructure? ito ay kung lumago nga ang ating economy. matapos ang 2 dekadang pamumuno niya, anong nangyari sa economy natin? do marcos apologists give you any economic data, kahit ano gaya ng yearly gdp growth rate, o sinasabi lang nila na ""naramdaman at nakita"" nila ang progress at prosperity noon? oo, maganda naman talaga ang simula, pero tignan natin ang long-term effects. tinatawag nila itong ""golden age"" kahit nag-collapse ang economy natin sa early 1980s dahil hindi na tayo makabayad ng utang sa world bank at nagka-recession during his term. see [this image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ekhz98nz5fx8pzqe8306y7-csjhawppy/view) (verifiable at the psa website) sa gdp growth rate ng economy natin under marcos and a more detailed analysis [here](https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/money/content/172779/martial-law-costly-lessons-in-economic-development/story/). ang problema kasi, pinagbabasihan lang nila ang mga nakita nila at own experiences lang. oo, maganda at payapa ang buhay nila, pero hindi nila nire-represent ang buong bansa. bagsak ang economy leading to massive **inflation**, tapos isisisi nila lahat sa next admins. sobrang negative din ng tingin ng marami sa privatization o pagbenta ng government firms kaya isisisi nila lahat sa aquinos, pero may times na mas efficient pa mag-manage ng business ang private sector, kasi nag-invest sila mismo, kumpira sa government na may inefficiencies and red tape. halimbawa, ang bangui windmill farm ay owned and managed by a private corporation. hindi ako dilawan dahil wala naman talagang perfect na adminstration—may injustices din under the aquinos—pero sana aware tayo na iniwan ni marcos na sobrang lubog ang bansa sa utang or [high debt-to-gdp ratio](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gbnetxycvytwzr2_sd_7jod2qdv7klda/view?usp=drivesdk) at bagsak ang ekonomiya. ang privatization ay kahit papaano nakatulong ma-manage ang ating utang. sana wag magbase lang sa outward appearances or facades of progress. tignan natin ang mas malawak na konteksto kung bakit talagang napag-iwanan tayo. at kahit gaano kagaling ang isang leader (kahit pa may photographic memory siya), kagaling siyang magsalita, ka-inspiring ang kaniyang vision, o katindi ng kaniyang political will, ito ang hard lesson sa atin: competence is important but not as important as character. &nbsp; ##4. puro charity lang yan si leni! band-aid solution. di yan para sa long-term progress ng bansa natin! &nbsp; paglilinaw: hindi naman dahil nag-take siya ng initiatives na tumulong ay ibig sabihin noon ay wala siyang kamalayan sa long-term na makakatulong sa economic growth. hindi vp ang nagco-control ng spending natin sa infrastructure. pero graduate si leni ng economics sa up diliman. alam niya ang kahalagahan ng infrastructure kaya itutuloy niya ang [build, build, build](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2021/10/29/2137559/robredo-says-continue-anti-drug-campaign-build-build-build-tweaks?fbclid=iwar12u_l5gubhl7f35bzxzqyu3esc2t965enw7pwpvyxzyhdzq_zfjhiff6s) pero makikinig din siya sa ating best civil engineers para ma-address for example ang ating traffic and congestion sa urban areas. nakita rin natin ang kaniyang efficient management of resources at [achievements](https://www.reddit.com/r/leni2022/comments/qkl0wk/megathread_achievements_and_statements_of_maria/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) as vp kahit relatively maliit ang budget na inilaan sa ovp. at makikinig din siya sa mga experts and our best economists. ang kaibahan sa kaniya, mas confident tayo na hindi niya nanakawan ang kaban ng bayan. alam din natin na maglalagay siya ng professional leaders na nararapat sa bawat department, hindi yung nilagay lang dahil sa pabor o para ma-enforce ang kapangyarihan. &nbsp; ##5. bayaran ang media! &nbsp; paglilinaw: oo, hindi perfect ang media, pero unlike most vloggers na clearly biased, ang media ay much more under threat na mahabla o maaaring makulong kung lumabag ito sa batas. let me illustrate: in case lang naman na sobra kang amazed o hanga kay bbm for ""his"" bangui windmill farm, let's get the facts right. oo, ina-acknowledge natin na he eagerly permitted, facilitated, and inaugurated its construction according to [this opinion piece](https://manilastandard.net/mobile/article/367795). similar to his parents, alam niya kung gaano kalakas ng hatak ng votes ng sights of [big infrastructures](https://opinion.inquirer.net/145027/our-infrastructure-fetish). gamit na gamit nga sa campaign niya halos lahat ng videos ay may kasamang windmill animation. pero tandaan din na ito ay initiated, constructed, and financed not by the government but by the **private sector**. for complete details, see [here](https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=assvkrokksyc&pg=pa83&hl=en&sa=x&ved=2ahukewjdv8ywinvzahuugkykhfugabcq6af6baggeai#v=onepage&q&f=false). pag binasa natin 'yon, si **ferdinand dumlao** ang isa sa nag-initiate ng bangui windmill farm. ngayon itong si **thinking pinoy** inaakusahan niya na mali mag fact-check si rappler. ang claim kasi ni tp ay yung bangui windmill farm ay initiated by bbm dahil si dumlao daw kasi ang ""ilocos norte's provincial special projects manager"" ni bbm. watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bghpacxoxh4&t=14m00s&feature=youtu.be) at the 14:00 mark. pero magkaibang dumlao kasi 'yon. ang under ni bbm ay **hindi** si ferdinand dumlao kundi si **chito** dumlao. read [here](https://www.manilatimes.net/2004/11/23/news/regions/bongbong-furious-at-ilocos-norte-killing-spree/683199). at ang daming naloloko. tandaan, **hindi** reliable source ang napakaraming facebook, youtube, and tiktok videos dahil punong puno ito ng propaganda, ilang taon na. wala sila madalas na reference na binibigay, puro accusation at stories. at kung may reference gaya ni thinking pinoy, mina-manipulate nila to fit their narratives. hindi naman masyadong mahirap pag-isipan kung saan nanggaling ang makinarya ng propaganda. tsaka yung iba rin ay nare-reinforce nalang ng positive feedback ng community nila at ng [dunning kruger effect](https://www.britannica.com/science/dunning-kruger-effect#:~:text=dunning%2dkruger%20effect%2c%20in%20psychology,or%20of%20people%20in%20general). tapos magke-claim ang mga apologist na bayaran ang rappler at abs-cbn na nag-report din naman sa katiwalian under the aquinos at previous admins gaya ng sa mendiola—see this [report by rappler](https://www.rappler.com/nation/mendiola-massacre-anniversary-same-injustices). *hmm... sino kayang candidate na kabaliktaran ni cory at [ipinagtanggol](https://www.manilatimes.net/2016/04/13/news/top-stories/sumilao-farmers-choose-leni/255921) ang mga farmers at mga mahihirap laban sa mga elite?* since they cannot attack the evidence, their tactic is to target the sources (media) at siraan sila. kaya wag naman tayo masyado padala sa mga sikat na influencers gaya ni ka tunying, yung inc na vlogger. ok sana kung mag-cite siya ng sources, kaya lang kadalasan ay chismis style lang. pero mabait naman siya, misinformed nga lang din at feel niya pinagtutulungan siya kaya para sa kaniya, masama tayong lahat. valid naman ang point niya, wag dapat ipairal ang galit. &nbsp; ##edit: i had an idea. what if ang volunteer animators natin ay bumuo ng inspiring video animation, na may nagna-narrate using this explanation? kahit yung 1st, 2nd, at 4th misconceptions lang. para pati yung mga tinatamad magbasa ay ma-enlighten. baka may ma-contact kayo. yung with inspiring music gaya ng kay william capistrano et al. tapos gawing ad. suggestion lang naman. 🙂 &nbsp; **sa counterarguments:** feel free to comment your criticisms and counterarguments. please include suggestions so we can engage in civil discourse at ma-edit and improve pa natin itong mga paglilinaw. &nbsp; **sa gustong mag-contribute ng sarili nilang paglilinaw sa comments:** use this format. *misconception:* *paglilinaw:* &nbsp; **sa mga bukas ang mata:** alam nating she is facing an uphill battle for our nation. kaya nananawagan ako na habang may oras pa, tumindig tayo at humakbang para sa bayan. sa kabila ng takot, sa gitna ng magulong politika at malakas na ingay ng propaganda, let us amplify [the voice of reason](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/mobile/folders/19vdfrfqgfboq0kwqcdiuqydtn_dsoaal?usp=drive_fs) at ating patunayan ang ating malasakit sa bayan.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/qx82zk/replying_to_misinformation_against_leni/,19 11 2021

Di ko alam paano mag “move-on”,"sorry at mejo late na pero di talaga ako makapag move-on. di ko kasi maintindihan. nalulungkot ako. i can’t make sense of whats happening. my parents met in college noong ‘83, aktibista sila. and growing up, palagi nilang kinukwento paano sila noon, yung mga kaibigan nila na bigla nalang nawala, mga na detain, etc. mahirap daw talaga ang buhay noong bata sila kaya sabi ng tatay ko, nagsumikap sila to give us a better future. kahit na may pagkakataon noon na umalis sa pinas, ayaw ng tatay ko. mahal nya ang pilipinas at sabi nya doon lang daw siya. during campaign period, nag h2h sila. pero sabi ng tatay ko, “we are trying our best but just prepare yourself because it looks like we’re outnumbered” kasi ang dami nya daw talaga nakakausap na lbm fanatics talaga. nung nanalo na, sobrang lungkot namin. isang linggo ako umiiyak (even now kapag naririnig ko yung rosas, lol) then i asked my dad at sabi nya lang “tayo nalang muna isipin natin”. pero ang bigat pa rin sa pakiramdam besh. paano ba ako magmomove on? ofw ako ngayon at plano ko na talaga umuwi this year. but i’m scared of the future in the philippines. alam mo yung ayaw ko na isipin at gusto ko sana bigyan ng chance ang bagong administration pero bigla akong may makikitang comment or statement or whatever from them na nakakapang-init ng ulo. naiinis ako. pero i feel helpless and its not good for my mental health na ito nalang pagali ko iniisip. i get headaches na kasi i can’t find a way how to move past this. paano ba?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/v3d9f5/di_ko_alam_paano_mag_moveon/,2 06 2022
Nahihiyang Kakampink,"minsan pag tinatanong ako ng mga tao kung 88m ako ang sinasagot ko, “hindi cia ang binoto ko.” pero pag nararamdaman nilang pink ako, hindi na ako umimiik. parang deep inside may sense of embarassment kasi kung sasabihin ko pa, kasi nga truth be told hindi naman talaga nanalo. at tinatawanan lang ang isang talunan. pero minsan pag mag isa ako, napapaisip ako. “bakit ba hindi ko kayang sabihin sa lahat na kakampink ako? mapapahiya ba ako?” kasabay ng mas nandidiri ako pag iniisip ng mga tao na yung anak ng apo ang sinuportahan ko. pero minsan naiisip ko, baka kaya hindi ko kayang sabihin na “kakampink ako” kasi sa mga ganitong panahon si leni ang image bearer ng kakampink movement, na para bang siya standard ng lahat. hindi ko kasi nakikita ang sarili ko sa kanya. pero sa pinaglalaban ng partido niya, oo andun ako. na oo kakampink ako. pero hindi si mama leni ung image na kaya kong irepresent bilang isang kakampink sa ngayon. kasi di ba, totoo naman eh kung sino ang kandidato mo cia ang anino mo. pakiramdam ko, hinahanda pa ng karanasan ung taong susuportahan ko bilang isang kakampink. hinahanda pa siya ng panahon para sa maraming pagsubok at paghihirap na dapat niyang ayusin para sa bansang pilipinas. siguro sa ngayon, isa akong nahihiyang kakampink. pero pagkaharap ko ang mga kasalungat, nakikita ko na handa silang makinig sakin pag ako ang nagpapaliwanag. nakikita ko na marami silang hindi alam. at hanggang facebook posts lang ang kaya nilang panghawakan. hindi pa nga lang ito ung tamang panahon para makumbinse ko sila na may pagkakataon pa para sa isang masaya at malayang buhay kung pipiliin nila tayo. pero mas tinatatak ko sa sarili ko na “tahimik na kakampink” muna ako. nag mamatyag. nakikisimpatya. nakikishare ng nalalaman niya para sa ikabubuti ng lahat. dadaan lang yang mga yan, pero hindi tayo mapapagod sumama sa laban. ung mga kilala nating kasalungat, pakitaan natin ng maganda. ung hindi kayang iprovide sa kanila ng pinili nila, tayo ang magbigay. may utak at damdamin pa rin maman ang mga tao. hindi man sila sumama sa atin, atleast hindi tayo nag kulang. at sa hinaharap unti unti ko ng ioovercome ang pagiging “nahihiyang kakampink” na ito kasi baka meron iba, may tiwala sakin pagdating sa iboboto ko, pero dahil hindi ako nagpaparamdam wala silang guiding light na nakikita. mahaba habang laban pa ito. sana makapag plano tayo ng maayos at garantisado. higit sa lahat, para sa bansa. para sa kapwa pilipino.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/xyn3mb/nahihiyang_kakampink/,8 10 2022

"Take any job until you find yout dream job, Pride won't buy you bread.","""take any job until you find you dream job, pride won't buy you bread."" — i just wanna share this. take the lesson you think you learn. i wrote this wholeheartedly. when i was studying, my family was not well off. hindi ko afford bumili ng bagay na gusto ko, mahirap lang kasi kami. i graduated highschool and it's time for college— alam kong hindi afford ng magulang ko na paaralin ako. so nag start ako as workinh student, nag apply ako sa jollibee as service crew. naalala ko na one time nakita ako doon ng mga kaklase ko ng highschool na hindi ko naman kaibigan at pinag tatawanan nila ko. ( sabi ko sa isip ko, wow. ang baba ng tingin nila sa service crew?) all around ako sa jb, taga hugas , taga map, taga ligpit, taga serve ng order — gusto ko maging cashier pero dahil baguhan ako, hindi pwede. dun ko din na experience ang salbahing katrabaho. fast forward, naging awake ako sa hirap ng buhay at hirap kumita. habang nag aaral nag trtrabaho ako. nakakapagod, nakakaiyak — may time na gusto ko na mag suicide. medical course ang inaaral ko noon, sobrang stressful. 10 hrs sa isang major subject tapos kinabukasan trabaho. hindi ko alam kung paano ko kinakaya. may time na habang nag tratrabaho bigla na lang akong lumuluha. na over come ko yun, nag trabaho ako sa mcdonald's bilang crew, sa city hall bilang assistant, lahat ng pwedeng diskarte habang nag aaral. ar'yan ang pangkukutsa ng kakilala dahil di naman nila alam ang sitwasyon o dahilan bakit mo ginagawa iyon. but i kept going. pa graduate na sana ako, nasa 4th na ako ng kolehiyo. ngunit may hindi magandang nangyari. kinailangan ko huminto at nag apply ako sa bpo/call centers. (sabi ng ilan na walang alam ay bagsakan ng mga walang tinapos, which is a stereotype dahil hindi totoo. hindi ka makakapasok sa bpo kung wala kang skills at utak.) kinailangan ko suportahan ang pamilya ko at kumita ng mas malaking pera dahil nagkasakit noon ang lola ko. sa makatuwid, mula ng mag umpisa akong magtrabaho, hindi ko na natapos ang kurso ko. (back story: sa college, binubully ako ng professor dahil loner ako, pano lahat ng kaibigan ko noon ay nagibang kurso na at hindi kinaya ang medical course) so masasabi ko nung panahon na ito, nasa kasagsagan ako ng depression. ito talaga ang panahon na umiiyak ako gabi gabi sa sakit ng mga nararamdaman ko sa buhay. i was a mess. 3 years later — yung mga kaibigan at ilang kaklase ko na naka tapos ng kolehiyo, wala silang trabaho. ""hard work pays off"". hindi ko akalain na magiging itaas akk. kung noon na ako ang inuutusan, ako na ang nag uutos. laking pasasalamat ko sa panginoon sa mga nangyari sa buhay ko. kasalukuyan akong nag tr'trabaho bilang manager ng isang kilalang center sa pinas. may ilang beses na nag mensahe sakin ang ilan kong naging kaklase noon, na binully at tinawanan ako , nagpapa tulong silang makapasok. — tinulungan ko naman sila kaya lang hindi kaya. hindi nila maipasa ang exam para makapag trabaho sa center. bakit kaya? nakatapos naman sila at ang yayabang nila noon? ( nakarma ba sila dahil sa pambubully nila sakin at pangmamata nila sa kapwa? ) upang lumawak pa ang aking kaalaman, habang nagtratrabaho pa din, nag aaral ng kursong related sa business, online nga lang pero sa isang unibersidad na. mga bagay na hindi ko kaya bilin noon, ngayon na kaya ko na, mga lugar na hindi ko kaya puntahan noon, ngayon napupuntahan ko na. ngunit nandun pa din ang pakiramdam na kailangan may ma accomplish ako, hindi para sa iba kundi para sa sarili ko. na kahit nasa itaas na ako, hindi ako titigil matuto, hindi ko itetenga ang aking sarili. saludo ako sa lahat ng breadwinners na madaming sinakrepisyo para lang sa pamilya nila. you win this life. life is too short to have regrets, live in the present moment and do your best with this one life given to you. maraming salamat sa pagbabasa.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/117rkjo/take_any_job_until_you_find_yout_dream_job_pride/,21 02 2023
Is it still worth it to take the board exam?

ManiPopCon,"wala na. nangyari na eh. wala akong idea how was the other activities sa ibang floors pero ito yung naranasan ko/namin. marami pang rants sa post ng manipopcon page. day 2: mackenyu solo panel nandun na kami bago mag-open yung mall para kahit na vip kami, sure na nasa harapan kami. pagkapasok ng mall, may table dun for strapping. nagtanong kami kung saan yung pila para makapasok sa main stage. ang sabi lang “just go in this area because people are also waiting for the organized line to start”. edi sobrang kalat kung nasaan yung mga tao sa area na sinasabi nila. walang queue number or idk baka nasanay lang kami sa ibang events(?) banda 11am, pinapila na kami sa may strapping area. sobrang gulo at unahan. dun din pala sa pinagtanungan ko, edi sana pinapila na nila agad. yung iba akala nila 2 lines for vip. di sinabi na yung left line ay para sa free tickets at yung right ay para sa vip. yung mga nasa unahan sa left line na may vip tickets, pumila ulit tuloy sa bandang likod na ng right line. wala man lang label. pagkapasok…. expected 11:45am yung start ng gma artists pero namove hanggang 1pm at nauna yung pagames nila na dapat after pa ni macken. after that, short break daw muna na bago si mackenyu hanggang umabot ng 3pm. nagpawarm up pa yung host eh tatlong oras na kaming naghihintay sana ang ginawa nyo cooldown kasi mainit na ulo namin. wala silang sinabing dahilan bakit nadelay. solo panel started and ended. ganyan lang kabilis hahahahaha! you can literally see the disappointment of everyone nung sinabi na tapos na. ilang minutes? 10-15mins. lang. kung naging on time siguro sila, mas mahaba pa ang solo panel ni macken na kahit sya ay nagulat na natapos na agad. after this solo panel, we purchased the add-on na digital copy kasi sabi ng staff sa 1st floor at sa fb page nila, di raw kasama yun sa vip premium experience. (will connect this story kinabukasan and see how their staffs had lack of communication and poor planning) day 3: mackenyu photo-op & autograph session nakita namin sa twitter and fb yung gap between macken and fans sa photo-op. jusko kasya pa si lord. mukha rin syang standee wtf na parang isa nga lang pose pero ganun talaga sya sa lahat ng m&g overseas. may tape sa floor para di mo lapitan. understandable pero di naman namin yan iuuwi or yayakapin if the artist don’t want to. sabi bc of japanese management daw, well now i know bakit wala masyadong jap artists na nagagawi rito. super strict. nagpunta na ako sa strapping sa 5th floor at pinakita yung qr ko for vip and add-on na digital copy. sabi ng staff sa booth, i can refund yung digital copy kasi kasama na raw dapat yun sa vip. i was like huh? kala ko yung express lane lang. sabi nya di raw, so i messaged the main fb page for refund. (continuation at the end) smooth naman yung experience ko sa loob ng photo op, yun lang yung gap talaga tho medyo malapit na yung batch namin compared kahapon (meron ding photo op kahapon). autograph time. sobrang weird ng atmosphere lol. konti na lang yung tao pero pagkapasok ko, nasa sulok si macken tapos madilim (theater eh pero alam ko pwede pang buksan yung ilaw hello???). pagkalapit ko sa table nya, para syang preso na pinagigitnaan ng dalawang pulis. ganon. ang lungkot. i know he wants to do more for his fans but something is stopping and controlling him. nagmukha tuloy masungit si macken kqgaya ng mga sinasabi sa twt lol, but being macken’s fan for years, i don’t believe on those hear-says. continuing the add-on refund story (pauwi na ako nito kaya ito yung last lol), lumapit ako dun sa booth sa 1st floor para sabihin na bakit di nya sinabi na kasama na yun sa vip tapos pinagbayad pa kami. nagulat din sya kasi hindi raw kasama. kanino ko raw nakuha yun. like???? di ba kayo nag-uusap ng staffs nyo? wala kayong gc? bakit yun ang sinasabi nila sa 5th floor? buti di na ako pinaakyat ulit no kaloka. narefund naman sakin pero yun lang parang di sila nag-uusap lol",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/17zasz1/manipopcon/,19 11 2023
Programs for Ex-convicts,"meron ba dito na may family na ex-convict? how did you help them start again? meron ba silang pabahay or job/work program para sa kanila? my tito (50m), nakulong sya (arson) noong 1998 at supposedly 2005 lang dapat makakalaya na sya pero wala sa mga kapatid nya yung nakatulong sa kanya para ayusin mga papeles. including my tatay, never kinwento ng tatay ko pero alam ko guilty sya di nya natulungan kapatid n‘ya - di nakatapos hs tatay ko at construction worker sya nung mga panahon na yun. nasa kulungan pa tito ko, binenta na ng mga kapatid nila yung bahay nila which is dapat sa kanya. ngayon, wala na sya mapuntahan. wala sya trabaho, pasideline sideline lang. nagpapalipat lipat sya sa mga kamag-anak namin for four years. now nandito sya samin, nauutus utusan at tumutulong sa gawaing bahay. gusto ko sana sya tulungan para makatayo sa sarili nya, nung lumaya kasi siya 500 lang daw binigay as pamasahe tapos bahala na. wala na kasi tumatanggap sa kanya as formal employee, he was only 24 nung nakulong sya. wala din sya mga papeles. ang alam nya gawin ay magconstruction at magtinda tinda. inaalok ko sya na baka gusto nya magtinda fishball or proben, ako sasagot lahat ng need para makastart sya pero ayaw daw nya at nahihiya sya baka di nya mapanindigan. baka may alam kayong way how to help them? may coop or programs ba to support them? thank you so much. minsan nagkekwento sya sakin, “nak, sana pala di na lang ako pinalabas sa munti. mas maganda buhay ko dun, may sarili akong kwarto. nagtatanim ako gulay, nabebenta ko.” naaawa ako kasi pakiramdam ko his life was robbed from him. 😔 p.s. background sa case nya is lola ko ang nagkaso. sinunog ng tito ko yung gitna ng bahay nila - sya yung nagpatayo pero gusto ibenta ng lola ko. ito din yung same house na binenta ng mga kapatid nya kalaunan.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/14kjok7/programs_for_exconvicts/,27 06 2023
"The people antagonizing BBM and the whole UniTeam party should really lessen the direct attacks. We're trying to win the votes over, not make them look stupid.","okay some context like - i come from a household dominantly voting for bbm and the whole uniteam, when i tried asking family members bakit ayun yung naging choice nila, their answer has some hard truths in it: ""kaya ayaw namin kay leni, kasi masiado siyang mapag malinis. yung mga boboto sakanya akala mo kung sinong self-righteous."" at first glance, kung titignan mo naman nga kasi character ng mga nasa uniteam, may track record talaga ng pag nananakaw/pag patay/tax evasion etc. pero at the end of the day, when we engage kasi in arguments with the people that are voting for this party, naiintindihan ko rin kasi side nila na ramdam nila sila yung masama eh. alam niyo yun? pano ka ba naman gaganahan mag switch over kung pine-paint lang ng mga tao yung election as black and white. may masamang kampo - may mabait, nawawala yung purpose ng pag dedebate rin kung sino ba yung leader na sa tingin natin makakapag ayos ng direction ng bansa natin. personally, ngayon ko lang din na realize na mali rin yung approach ng karamihan when it comes to winning over the favors of people that we consider ""bobotante"", marami rin naman sakanila critical thinkers and many many more know na may bahid rin ng korapsyon yung pinipili nila, kaya ang nagiging frame of mind: ""kung boboto nalang ako ng kandidato, doon ako sa kandidato na hindi nag mamalinis."" kasi kung titignan mo rin campaign nila leni, isko, manny and ping, parang may pinapahiwatig rin sila na wala silang kinalaman sa korapsyon, which may or may not be true - pero sa mata ng maraming tao na naranasan mismo epekto ng korapsyon, syempre parang na invalidate mo experience nila. nakakahusga rin sila kung sino yung nag tatago lang ng ambisyon. kaya sa tingin ko lang din, the best course of action right now is to stop antagonizing anyone. mas lalo lang sila tumitibay na panindigan desisyon nila kasi nakukumpirma din nila sa pag uugali mo - as a supporter of other candidates, na parang maling mali lahat ng alam nila. syempre alam mo naman din mga pilipino, ma pride din yan at marami pa satin mainit na mainit pa ulo kapag nilatagan mo ng actual facts and credible sources - kasi sa karanasan ng marami, most filipinos are distrustful of government institutions/the government as a whole. and to be honest, sa tingin ko rin kasi dapat piliin rin natin kung sino sa tingin natin yung mapapa-switch over sa candidate mo. plenty of them are already locked in, mga ride and die na talaga in the end kasi sa isip nila na far too deep in na sila para mag back out. so i think the best course of action talaga sa ganito yung humanap nalang ng iba na open minded and skeptic din. also just to add, based on human behavior din kasi, i think the easiest way to start a civil discussion is finding common ground muna. ayan yung mas magandang panimula kung makikipag talo ka man sa kahit sinong supporter ng political candidate. finding common ground lets you talk kung ano yung nakita nilang errors at tska strengths ng kada kandidato. kung dyan palang mismo sarado na isip ng mga boboto, eh sa tingin ko hindi pa nila nasuri talaga yung mga plataporma ng bawat isang kandidato and just basing their vote on the personalities/backgrounds of the presidentiables. let's try to start conversations with ""alam mo sana ayusin nila agrikultura sa pilipinas."" general statement at tska magandang panimula para mag simula kayo ng usapan kung ano na ba yung mga alam nilang proyekto o plataporma don sa kandidatong boboto nila. kung dyan palang na engage mo na sila, i don't think its outside the realm of possibility na isipin rin nila yung plataporma nung kandidato mo. let's say for example, nagusuthan nila plataporma ng kandidato mo, dun niyo ngayon subukan ipag kumpara yung plataporma ng kandidato niyong napili, pero syempre, hold back on personal biases muna at tska wag mo rin i-sales talk sakanila agad yung kandidato mo. based on that, sa tingin ko marami na agad na taong mamumulat din at tska mapapaisip kung sigurado na ba sila sa iboboto nilang kandidato.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/st1cej/the_people_antagonizing_bbm_and_the_whole_uniteam/,15 02 2022

Hello mananakot muna ako ngayong palapit na ang November,"""bintana"" - a spooky/creepy story witnessed by a 9-year old me share ko lang yung isa sa mga pinaka nakaka kilabot na nasaksihan ko. nangyari ito nung 9 years old palang ako. namatay noon ang lola ko (tita ni mama) at burol nya ng panahong yun. umalis sila mama at papa nung gabing iyon para pumunta at mag bantay sa funeraria, kaya naiwan kami ng ate ko sa bahay kasama yung pinsan ni mama na si tita jeng. buong araw ay naglaro lang kami at nilutuan lang kami ni tita jeng ng mga pagkain, at nagkwentuhan din kami ng mga bagay tungkol kay lola. ka-close namin si tita jeng at madalas namin syang nakakalaro kapag bumibisita sya sa bahay dati. malas lang namin at nag brownout pa sa lugar namin nung hapon at sinabi na bukas pa ng umaga babalik ang kuryente. alam ni tita jeng na hindi kami nakaka tulog nang mainit kaya sinabi nya ay papaypayan nya kami hanggang makatulog kami. kinagabihan, nagsindi nalang si tita jeng ng lampara at naghanda na sya ng hapunan namin. pagkatapos namin kumain ng hapunan ay pinatulog na kami ni tita. kalagitnaan na ako noon ng pagtulog ko nang magising ako bigla ng madaling araw dahil sa naririnig kong tunog ng jalousie sa bintana namin na tila binubuksan ito mula sa labas ng bahay namin. akala ko ay naalimpungatan lang ako pero nang marinig ko ang sigaw ng tita ko na ""mamay?? mamay??"" ay nagising ako nang tuluyan. nagising rin ang ate ko nun dahil sa sigaw ni tita jeng. bumangon ako at una kong tinignan si tita jeng, na paluha nang naka tingin at naka turo sa bintana. dali dali ay tumingin ako sa bintana at kitang kita ko ang tila kamay na naka hawak sa jalousie ng bintana namin at unti unti nitong binubuksan ang bintana. grabe ang kilabot na naramdaman ko dahil kitang kita ng aking dalawang mata at dinig na dinig ko rin yung matandang babae na naka ngiti at sumisitsit ng paulit ulit na naka tingin sa tita ko. lahat kami ay hindi na naka galaw sa takot at kilabot na naramdaman namin. wala na kaming ibang nagawa kundi titigan sya habang tumatawang sumasayaw palayo ng bahay namin. hinding hindi ko makakalimutan kung paano gumalaw ang matandang iyon habang papalayo sya sa bintana namin. tila parang sayaw ng isang baliw at hindi iyon magagawa ng kahit sinong matanda. labis pa ang takot na naramdaman ko nang biglang sinabi saamin ni tita na ""hindi nyo ba nakilala yon?"". bigla kong naalala yung mukha nung matanda na naaninag ko lang sa tulong nung lampara na sinindi ni tita jeng nung gabi. si lola yun. pero sinabi ni tita jeng na hindi si lola ang nakita namin, kundi isang masamang espiritu. kinabukasan ay kinwento namin kila mama at papa ang nangyari at mismong sila ay kinilabutan din sa kwento namin. simula noon ay natatakot na akong tumingin sa bintana na iyon, dahil naaalala ko parin hanggang ngayon kung gaano nakaka kilabot yung nakita ko.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/yf9509/hello_mananakot_muna_ako_ngayong_palapit_na_ang/,28 10 2022

Worth Reading and Contemplating to,"tanda ko no'n, may student akong g na g sa mga raliyista. naratibo niya lagi- ""sumunod na lang kasi kayo, 'wag puro angal! mas matalino pa kayo sa gobyerno"" dahil diyan, may isang lesson akong tinuro sa kanya, na sa tingin ko'y di niya makakalimutan. isang araw, pumasok ako sa klase nila. tapos nag-announce ako na ngayon ako magpapa-midterm. so siyempre, expected ko ng makakatanggap ako ng negatibong reaksyon mula sa kanila, at isa na siya roon. ang sabi niya- : sir, base sa academic calendar po, next week pa po ang midterm. kaya di po kami handa ngayon. tapos base rito sa saklaw ng exam niyo, iyong iba po rito, di niyo pa po naituturo. -mr. ****, klase ko ito kaya ako mausunod. huwag ka ng puro angal diyan. : pero kasi sir... - sumunod ka na lang! mas marunong ka pa sa akin! tandaan mo, ako ang prof dito. habang nagi-eksam siya, kita kong namumugto na mga mata niya. ramdam ko iyong takot niyang bumagsak. siguro may scholarship siyang need alagaan. sa kalagitaan ng exam, pinahinto ko sila. at ipinaliwanag ko kung bakit iyon ang inasal ko kanina. ipinaunawa ko sa kanila ang kahalagahan ng pagkakaroon ng boses sa mga injustice na nakikita nila sa kanilang paligid, lalo na kung ang gobyerno ay bingi at bulag dito...na ang pagpuna sa kanila ay hindi na ngangahulugang paglaban. kundi isang uri ng pagpapaalala sa kanilang mandato- ang maglingkod at mangalaga. ang pagpuna sa mga nakaluklok ay hindi nangangahulugang pagpapakita na mas magaling tayo sa kanila, na sasagutin ng pabalang na- ""e di ikaw na maging presidente!"". kasi sa totoo lang, hindi mo naman kailangang maging matalino at magkaroon pa ng phd degree para mapansin mo ang katiwalian, kabuktutan at lanta-lantarang pananamantala.. ang kailangan mo lamang ay magkaroon ng pakiramdam at maging mulat sa nangyayari sa bansa mo. aaminin ko, may mga pagkilos at rally na wala minsan sa konteksto at hulog. pero wag sana nating i-generalize na lahat ng rally ay ganito. na hindi pa rin nito mapagtatakpan ang katotohanang marami tayong prebilihiyong natamasa na utang natin sa mga taong sumigaw para isakatuparan ito. night differential pay, 13th month pay, at mismong free tuition fee sa mga state u, iilan lamang iyan sa napakaraming benepisyong natamasa natin dahil mayroong sumigaw para sa atin. uulitin ko, ang pagpuna sa gobyerno ay hindi nangangahulugang gusto mo mag-fail ang gobyerno. nagsasalita ka kasi may malasakit ka sa bayan mo. lalo na kung nakakaligtaan ng gobyerno iyong mga pangako niya sa sambayanang pilipino. totoo, walang perpektong gobyerno, kaya nga nandito tayo para laging magpaalala sa mandato nila. by: kaide anggot (fb)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/une47i/worth_reading_and_contemplating_to/,11 05 2022

Truth why children struggles for reading comprehension in my POV,"i have worked part time as an assistant for my late mother when she was a teacher until she became a principal so i think i'm qualified to post this at least. so bakit nga nagiistruggle ung mga bata especially reading comprehension, what's happening within the school system and this is what i observed for 8 years i have worked in deped. 1. teachers are being worked for community services like feeding programs. imo dapat lgu services ang gumagawa nito not teachers. isa ito sa mga matrabahong ginagawa nila kaya nababawasan ang attention sa bata. pinakahassle dito ung liquidation which really drains the life out of you. 2. teachers are being worked for data reports instead of adding an employee for the task. isa ito sa mga pinakaiinisan ng mga teachers. not just time consuming, nakakalito pa sa dami ng data kailangang ipasa sa deped within a short period of time. the higher-ups mentality: kung ayaw mo humanap ka ng ibang trabaho (what a nice way to motivate teachers amiright?!). this job causes teachers para tamarin ng magturo, imbes na lesson plan ang inaatupag nasa data reports na, kaya paggawa ang grades ng bata dinaig pa na galing sa rekto para hindi na sakit sa ulo. also teachers have a hard time adjusting to technology especially yung mga nagstart pang nagturo since 90's era na nasanay na sa papel kaya madaming pinaparework na reports which again causes them to advert their attention from the students. 3. ito masakit: deped really doesnt give a fuck about children performances. totoo naman eh, they only care about the data they demand from the schools wether it is invented or not basta napirmahan at naaprubahan bahala na yung bata kung marunong o hindi. ang bottom line ng mga teachers kung bakit imbento na yung grading especially sa reading comprehension dahil sa reasons 1 & 2 (dagdag mo pa yung mga bata na ayaw matuto). also matrabaho ang magparemedial reading at apektado din grades mo as a teacher dahil mababa ung grado ng reading comprehension ng bata habang naghahabol ka ng data reports ng deped(o diba ang dami). so anong solusyon? ipasa mo nalang kahit hindi marunong. wala man lang akong nakitang employee na nagveverify ng reading comprehension ng mga students. basta ang kalakaran as long as papers goes it goes. 4. corruption in deped and broken promises. my mother (school principal) and her teachers are always promised laptops since 2017 pero walang dumadating. during their seminars laging pinagmamalaki ng regional supervisor for this annual budget at magkakaroon sila ng makabagong gamit. welp never happened, outdated parin laptops ng mga teachers, i think 2015 pa ata ung models na ginagamit ng mga teachers dito ofc im not going to disclose the location. this mostly started during duterte's term pero nung kay pnoy madami laging bagong learning materials at libro hindi pa masyado uso laptops noon. demanding ang deped pero hindi progressive yan ang katotohan sadly. out of touch ang higher-ups sa mga front liners kaya tayo umabot sa ganito. teachers works are overloaded and demanding yet underpaid. so kung may opinions pa kayo just comment down below.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/wsv9x2/truth_why_children_struggles_for_reading/,20 08 2022

My thanksgiving dinner experience with a BBM family.,"so eto nga guys, nag-punta kami (me (f), my wife (f) my sister and her bf) reluctantly sa invitation ng ilocano-bbm tita na kapit-bahay namin. may pinag-samahan naman yung family kahit papano, before elections super ganda ng communication namin sa kanila kasi kapitbahay namin dito sa canada. saktong usapan lang, nag-dasal kami bago kumain. to be honest, ang ganda nung prayer. as an agnostic, na-appreciate ko naman siya. pero gagi, yung kapatid ko brining-up yung pag-unfriend ko sa tito ko na misogynistic bbm supporter din tapos sabi sakin bigla nung bbm na tita: ""kayo kasi maka-leni kayong lahat diba? dapat di na kayo nagpapa-niwala sa kwento kwento lang. dapat sa totoong news sources lang."" mind you, binigyan ko lang siya nuon ng heads-up na fake yung website source niya (halatang fake kasi no actual sources from credible organizations, news sites, people, also the ones she sent me usually walang https:// (unsecure-doesnt mean all with https:// are legit as well) tapos yung design nung buong site, parang cult na may agila, illuminati sht - web designer and dev ako) tapos kinimkim pala niya yun. di ko nalang tinuloy yung pag-rebut ko kasi yung wife ko natatakot na magalit ako. i was very polite about it kasi mas matanda siya sakin and i was just looking out for her. then na-bring up nanaman ng kapatid ko about yung recently nangyari kay leila de lima. gagi nagulat ako sabi ng panganay niyang babae, ""dapat pinatay na nila yun. tinuluyan na dapat sinaksak."" sabay silang pamilyang tumawa (aside sa bunso na awkward sa situation) i felt chills. paanong nakakapag-dasal ng ganun kaganda tapos without any hesitations, would wish harm on other people just like that. ps. sinabihan din nung bbm tita yung mom ko directly bakit ako nag-cocomment and nag-popost na kumakalaban sa views niya. tas sabi ni bbm tita ""isang post mo nalang eh sasampalin na kita."" sabay tawa. eto din isang kinagalit ko sila yung traditional toxis filipino family. lakas nilang i-body shame yung asawa ko sa harap ko? muntik na talaga nag-liparan ang mga lumpia. anyways, officially cut ties with them na. may bbm supporter akong mga kakilala pero not that extreme (madalas dahil lang kasi ilocano. &nbsp; &nbsp; (edit) just to answer some questions. &nbsp; > quote q1. why was politics bough up nung dinner? i did not want to talk about politics because i knew it was going to be a mess, pero my sister thought our casual arguments sa fb nuon nung tita is civil and casual. she thought wrong. she had no idea the tita was extremely pro-marcos. she tried to change the topic but we decided na umalis bago magka-gulo (because i get really unpleasant pag nasimulan ko nang magalit and isa yun sa puna ng wife ko sakin kaya ayaw ko siya lalo ma-stress) anywho, lesson learned sa kapatid ko lol &nbsp; >quote q2. di bako sumagot or stoop up for what i believe in? i tried. di sa pag-tanggol sa pagkatalo or sa binoto ko, pero sa misinformation na nagbblur sa totoo at hindi. ang sagot sakin ""naniniwala ka kasi sa fake news. dun ka sa totoong balita lang. wag sa kwento kwento sa facebook at tiktok."" can't argue with people who always things they're right. siya nag-banggit na kay leni kami nag-vote last election and my side of the family all nodded (said ""yes. syempre tita."") then she proceeded to complain about the philippines being poor right now and then overcompensating sa pag-puri kay bbm after niya magreklamo. lol also i don't ever want to stoop low para makipag-sampalan at murahan sa harap nung bunso nila (na awkwardly listening to her mom talk about marcos. i guess she's the ""odd"" one in the family.) &nbsp; >quote q3. but they body-shamed your wife? di ka pumatol? as mentioned i can become harsh pag galit ako. my wife doesn't like me when i'm at that point of anger kaya we just looked at each other and signaled na umalis na. although i told them my wife is building strength kasi nag-ddeadlift siya. di nila alam ata kung ano yun. tbh nung tumahimik ako, napansin nung bf ng sister ko and akala daw nila may gagawin ako. i'm honestly surprised i held it in like that. i'm quite proud of myself. charot &nbsp; >quote q4. important ba sila sa inyo? nung bago-bago palang kami sa canada isa yung tita na nagshashare ng food niya samin sa work, nag-lolook out for us and genuinely concerned if we were okay. kaya masakit din na this happened. &nbsp; >quote q5. anong nangyari sa fresh lumpia? binigyan kami ng pa-take home pero wala na gusto kumain. binalik ko yung plate nila kahapon pero di ko na kinausap. iniwan ko nalang sa pinto nila. &nbsp; &nbsp; >quote edit: clarified that not all websites with ""https://"" are legit din.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/y1fwdi/my_thanksgiving_dinner_experience_with_a_bbm/,11 10 2022

Root Canal Inquiry,"under going kasi ako ng root canal. gusto ko lang magtanong regarding pricing ng root canal and the prices ng bawat proseso. sinabi kasi ng dentist ko na 5k per canal. tapos may sinabi pa ata about sa pricing ng filler which is 7k which is di ko kinuwestiyon initially kasi first timer ako. tapos finally, the crown ranging from 6.5k to 20k pesos. so ang quote sa akin is, since two canals sya: 5k x 2 (root canal itself), 7k x 2 (for filler??), and then the crown kung ang kukunin is yung pinakamahal (20k). in total, around 44k na sya. ngayon nagtanong-tanong ako sa ibang clinic: 3.k php per canal, 700php filler per canal, and crown ranging from 6k to 20k din. ang laki nung gap ng pricing nila especially sa filler na yan na mas mahal pa sa root canal mismo. kaya i opted na magtanong na rin sa community to make sense out of this. kung tama ba yung mga info na nakukuha ko. bale naumpisahan na sya, under cleaning and inu-obserbahan pa kung meron pang pain. pero pagdating sa filler procedure, binabalak kong magpull out then ipagawa sa iba na mas fair yung pricing. medyo masakit kasi the other day yung tooth, and gusto ko sya isalba/maibsan yung pain agad that time kaya pinaumpisahan ko na rin agad yung procedure. location ko pala is sa province around north luzon. salamat po sa magrereply.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/14p93h0/root_canal_inquiry/,3 07 2023

The 6th Stage: Defiance,"so, ayun na nga. ibang mundo na ang ating gigisingan. the dragon has fully reared its head. duterte coming into power in 2016 was but a tendril of smoke heralding the return of a marcos-with an all new cast of cronies! super. ngayon, sabay sabay natin matututunan ang totoong ibig sabihin ng pagtindig laban sa karimarimarim na dilim. tulad ng paglaban ng mga lolo’t lola, nanay, at tatay natin nung 1972. training wheels are off. totoo nga na papunta na tayo sa exciting part. nakakatakot. nakakapangilabot na yung dating mga binabasa mo lang, napapanuod mo lang sa dokyumentaryo, baka makita mo na sa mundong ginagalawan mo. nung una, i did not know how to cope, so lahat ng brand ng copium tinikman ko. hagulgol. galit. ang bobobo, ang tatanga! nangangako ng aalis na. alexa, show me afams in my area. but curiously, as the most turbulent of the emotions eased, something remained. tahimik lang siya habang inuubos ng kaluluwa ko ang kalungkutan. ngayon na humihina na, mas naririnig ko siya, unflinching and steadfast. i feel defiant, *in a way that i have never felt like in my life*. baka ang tadhana ni vp leni ay hindi ang manalo noong may 9, kundi sindihan ang totoong kilusan. marami satin, siguro parang namatayan ngayon. pero may nabuhay rin. it’s new, tentative. pero it is a force that cannot be denied. rivulets of water that will eventually cleave apart solid stone. yung grit ng mga tao na nanatili hanggang 6:30am para lang makaboto. this anger? this movement? it is ours. it is *us*. there is no taking it away. sabi nga ni vp leni, ang mulat, hindi na muli mapipikit. pretty words if heard a week ago. ngayon, habang hindi makatulog at makapigil sa pagluha ang marami satin, siguro mas naiintindihan natin ang bigat ng ibig niyang sabihin. it is painful because you know. i believe it is that pain and grief that will keep us moving. masakit maging mulat. masakit hindi bumitaw. madalas ko isipin kung paano ba ako magsusurvive sa rehimen na ganito. hindi ko alam ang lahat ng sagot, pero may apat ako na suggestion na pwede pagsimulan: first: alagaan ang sarili. mahaba pa ang gabi. kailangan maganda't gwapo tayo hanggang mag-umaga. eat well, exercise, hydrate, meditate, stay centered, cry if you need to, know when you need to step away. you will need all of yourself during the coming years. second: mag-ingat online. alam naman natin na kasama sa technique ang red-tagging and troll farms. ingatan ang sensitive and personal information. don’t give them anything to work with. third: digital budd(ies) system. kung ang social media ay tool na ginamit para ilubog tayo, that means we can also use it to work in our favor. gamitin para bumunot ng lakas sa isa’t isa. now is not the time to isolate yourself. if you’re not already doing so, follow inspirational folks like chel diokno and walden bello. kahit hindi lang para sa balita, kahit paalala lang na hindi ka nag-iisa. fourth: do not forget who is really at fault. may magandang video si atty luke espiritu sa page niya sa fb (bawal maglink, pero madaling mahanap) explaining why it is not the masses who are to blame. we gain *nothing* from alienating and attacking each other, while evil counts on us staying divided. yung mga nagsasabi na stop helping para mapressure yung gobyerno, i do not think that will work. this is a government that will not care. we will be punishing the wrong people, and their oppressors will twist the truth to turn us even harder against each other. kung vp leni supporter ka, tulad ng marami satin dito, you would be betraying the principles she stands for. kahit yung mga nakain ng fake news and misinformation, biktima lahat yan. hindi natin alam ilang taon unti-unting binabago ng propaganda ang perception nila ng katotohan. the machinery has been hard at work for years. palagay ko, ngayon palang natin totoong sisimulan ang pagrehabilitate. the real evil are the people who willfully and deliberately voted because they had power to gain. the real evil are the structures and elites who produced marcos jr. yakap. mahal kita at ipaglalaban kita, sa kung paano ko man kakayanin. stay safe, stay defiant, folks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/unpff9/the_6th_stage_defiance/,12 05 2022

""i have to protect my family"". at bago niyo sabihin na magmove-on nalang, andaming mga biktima ng martial law na hindi pa nabibigyan ng reparations. ni hindi pa nga tayo nakakarinig ng sorry man lang mula sa pamilya nila. ni hindi pa nga natin nababayaran lahat ng utang natin mula sa panahon ng ama niya habang sila, ang yaman yaman na. at masakit isipin na basta nalang makakalimutan ang kauna-unahang beses sa kasaysayan natin na ang nagpahirap ng sobra sa bansa natin ay isang pilipino. sige, pwede naman natin tanggapin ang pagkapanalo ni marcos. madali naman 'yun, mapagpatawad naman ang pilipino. pero sa bawat araw na hinahayaan nating bumalik sa kapangyarihan ang pamilyang 'to, unti-unti naring mababaon sa limot ang hinaing ng mga biktima. unti-unti naring mawawala ang pag-asa na maibalik ang ninakaw ng pamilya nila. unti-unti naring mawawala ang hustisya. at kung mangyari man na hihingi ng tawad at mabibigyan ng hustisya ni bbm ang mga biktima ng kanyang ama, at i-angat niya ang pilipinas, edi sige, handa akong ibigay ang respeto ko sakanya. patunayan niya na hindi talaga kasalanan ng anak ang kasalanan ng ama. alam kong nakakainis at nakakapikon na hindi nalang hinahayaan ang resulta ng eleksyon, pero sana alam natin na ang pasakit na ito ay bunga ng malasakit para sa bayan. p.s. pasensya na, just had to let this out of my chest kasi andaming annoying na tao. lol",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/uoh21a/bakit_nga_ba_galit_ang_tao_sa_unofficial/,13 05 2022

Hindi na ulit ako magse-serve next Election,"una sa lahat.. tangina nyo comelec! nag-serve ako as support staff last may 9, 2022 election. ang siste... may pa-virtual training si comelec 3 weeks before election day. which is okay naman para prepared din yung mga magse-serve. 1 week before election, nagkaroon naman ng bigalaang f2f orientation (as in 3 hr notice), specific for support staff. medyo nakapagtataka lang, kasi after kami ma-assign as support staff, pinakitaan kami ng masterlist kung ilan at sino sino kami, pero nung nandoon na sa venue, may naabutan ako na group (6 na lalaki) na nag-a-attendance gamit ang name ng school namin. itinanong ko yun sa deso namin, ang sabi nya lahat ng nai-provide na personnel ng comelec ay kasama sa masterlist na ipinakita sa'min, so saan nanggaling yung anim, at sino magpapa-sweldo sa kanila? 5 days before orientation, may virtual training ulit (na hindi ko na alam kung ano ang purpose, at bakit pa kami nire-require um-attend, e pare-pareho lang naman sinasabi). 1 day before election may 8, pinapunta lahat sa school ang magse-serve sa election in preparation for the following day. 1pm kami pinapunta, pero 3pm na dineliver ang mga election paraphernalia (ballots, indelible ink, edcvl, etc..). tapos nire-require pa kami pumasok ng 4am the following day para daw masigurado na maaga kami makapag-start sa election. election day may 9, 2022. smooth naman transition sa school, sa tulong na din ng principal & other school personnel. pero around 7am, nagsimula magloko yung isang vcm, by 7:30 4 vcms na ang defective. 8:45am. naayos yung dalawang vcms, pero yung iba, walang update. 9:15am. nagkakagulo na sa 2 precincts dahil sa sirang vcm. hindi ma-contact ang comelec. nagsuggest ang eb na mag-waiver ang mga botante na gusto na makaboto, para iwanan na lang yung mga na-fill out na balora, at i-batch feed na lang sa harap ng watchers. 10:30am sabi ng comelec bawal daw yun. 10:45am. napalitan ang mga vcms pero sira naman ang sd cards. ang sinabi lang ng tech ni comelec, either aayusin or papalitan ng bago ang sirang sd card. pero parehonh sa laguna pa manggagaling. 3pm. nag-advise ang comelec na maghintay lang dahil sa laguna pa kukunin yung mga inayos sa sd cards. 7pm. end ng election. walang update si comelec may 10, 2022 12:30am. may mga nakapila na teachers sa bonifacio shrine para magsauli ng election paraphernalia 3:30am. nakapagsauli na ang mga teachers namin ng election paraphernalia sa comelec. ang masakit lang, yung pinakainiingatan na sd cards, literal na box lang ng sigarilyo ang storage. 5:00am. wala pa din update sa mga naiwang presinto sa school kung kailan ang delivery ng mga fixed sd cards nila. 9:00am. ide-deliver daw ng comelec ang sd cards before lunch. 5:30pm. dun pa lang dumating ang sd cards, at nakapag-start mag-batch feed ng balota ang mga teachers. (marami ang hindi nakaboto dahil ayaw pumirma ng waiver & natatakot na baka ma-tamper yung ballots nila kapag iniwan lang sa presinto) may 11, 2022 12:45am. nakatapos na mag-batch feed at papunta pa lang ng comelec ang mga staff para makapagsauli ng election paraphernalia. may 12, 2022 sinabi ng comelec na hindi sila makakapag-provide ng ot pay para sa mga staff na inabot ng 2 days sa presinto dahil hindi naman daw sila empleyado ng comelec. ang idinadahilan pa nila, alam naman daw ng mga teachers na possible mag-extend ng oras pag election, at ""konting sakripisyo"" lang naman daw yun para sa bayan. nakakagalit lang dahil teachers ang sobrang nahihirapan sa election, sila ang sumasalo ng frustrations ng mga botante. pero kung tutuusin, lahat ng problema sa election ay dahil sa incompetence ni comelec. napag-uusapan na namin sa school ngayon kung pwede mahikayat lahat ng school staff (teachers & admin) na wag mag-serve para sa next election (barangay election on dec. 2022).",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/upkx4v/hindi_na_ulit_ako_magseserve_next_election/,14 05 2022

Philippines - Reproductive & Contraceptive Methods Discussion,"ang hirap pala talaga mag avail nang contraceptives dito sa pinas no? i have been planning for a long time now already to consider using contraceptive methods since my bf and i have been living together for almost a year now. nung una pa lang, i already noticed na knowledge and guidance for the common people about this is very limited. there are no proper ways na accessible to learn the abcs of this. it's so hard for people like me who grew up without a family doctor to try and avail any healthcare extravaganzas. mangagapa ka talaga sa dilim. and now that i'm 23 yrs old na, it did not get easier. i tried to visit some websites, hopeful that i could find something or someone to help me with this case but to no avail. i ended up relying on random people's comments nalang and hearsay about it so i decided to give it a try. i first went to our local barangay health center to inquire about it. turns out, they would not entertain a childless individual na mag aavail ng contraceptives. i understand naman if priority nila yung mga patients na madami talagang anak. but instead of educating me about it, they instead replied using a degrading tone kung bakit ako mag aavail kung wala pa naman daw akong anak. di naman daw kailangan mag control pag wala pang anak. they even went as far as to be surprised when i said that my period lasts 7 days (which alarmed me since they work at a health center, they should know that women's period normally lasts between 2 to 7 days, right?) . when i got up to go, i even heard them mocking and laughing at me. days passed, i decided to try sa public local hospital since i have heard may services available sila dun. i must've been cursed kase it's the same thing. even worse because i got shamed and humiliated in front of other patients as the personnel who catered me got mad kung bakit ako nag aavail na dalaga pa naman daw ako. i tried to ask calmly then kung asan nya ko pwede ma refer na pwede mag cater sa mga childless individual seeking for contraceptives pero sinagot lang ako nang padabog na ""ewan ko basta hindi dito. family planning to eh tas wala kang pamilya. ba't mag co control ka pa wala ka naman palang anak?!"". i would understand if they would refuse me any services if that's their policy, masakit lang kase i am trying to do the right thing pero pinapahiya pa sa ibang tao. i am trying to find my way din naman kase wala talaga akong alam sa ganyan. nakaka disappoint lang.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/15by9f0/philippines_reproductive_contraceptive_methods/,28 07 2023
"""Hopefully, one day, we will be ready to walk where Leni goes""","my wife's would-be reply to a facebook post if she didn't delete it: so, if not radical love, ano? balik sa bardagulan era? balik sa pagsasara ng mga puso? kaya lang magmahal in the good times? nakalimutan na natin ung imahe ng mga robredo sisters na nakikipagkamay sa mga hindi naman boboto sa nanay nila? if there's anything i've learned from the campaign, it's the value to go out there and be with people na iba sa akin. hindi para burahin sila pero para magsimulang makipagkapwa, tao-sa-tao, puso-sa-puso. nakaka-frustrate yun kasi ang ganung relationship takes time. and for that to work, both parties dapat willing and open to make a connection. mind you, inis na inis din ako sa ugaling maka-marcos/duterte pero what can i expect sa mga taong puno na ng kasinungalingan ang mga utak at puso? and then i ask, so what kind of person will i be knowing na ganun sila? and the answer is situational. all i am sure of is, ayoko maging katulad ng kaaway ko. ayokong hayaan na lamunin ako ng poot at galit sa kapwa. gusto kong patuloy na tumindig para sa tama. gusto kong patuloy na magmahal sa abot ng aking makakaya. at the end of the day, hindi naman kasi tungkol sa akin ang movement na ito. hindi ako nandito para ipagsigawan sa mundo na tama ako, mali sila. nandito ako para manilbihan. at alam kong mahirap yun kasi mahirap mahalin ang iba sa akin at mas madali na lang to mind my own business. and for that, i give myself time to grow into a bigger person. well, i guess, we are not ready for leni. we are not ready to walk where she goes. hopefully, one day, we will be. kasi our strength only comes from being together. power of friendship, as they say. now that we are falling apart, masakit din. at mas humihirap din.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/uwhire/hopefully_one_day_we_will_be_ready_to_walk_where/,24 05 2022
My personal story of sadness and hope.,"gusto ko lang ishare tong experience ko kanina. bumisita ako sa 3rd month bday ng pamangkin ko. a family of 7 or 10(including yung mga asawa ng mga pinsan ko). habang nakain kami kinausap ako ng tita ko who i'm going to vote. syempre proud kong sinabi na leni dahil naniniwala ako na kaya niya. binalik ko yung tanong ang sabi niya bbm dahil si leni daw di niya gusto magsalit. tinanong ko siya san niya nadinig magsalita si leni? di niya ko masagot ng straight kasi tingin ko fb or tiktok niya yun nakita which is talamak ang fake news. then binanggit niya bigla yung luisita and other shits (sorry sa term). ang masakit sakin, sinabi ng tita ko na di siya tiwala kay leni at ok pang mangurakot si 88m basta kaya niyang pamahalaan at may magawa siya sa bansa. bumanat ako na, ""bakit tita? alam mo ba yung mga nagawa ni leni during this pandemic para matulungan ang taong bayan?) di niya ako masagot ng derecho at dinaan nalang namin sa tawa. close ko din mga pinsan ko sakanila. i was able to talk ng one on one dun sa isa kong pinsan that i know 88m noon na napapaisip kanina sa mga sineshare ko sakanya about what leni has done on my knowledge. i believe, he will shade number 10 tomorrow. and the glimpse of hope is my die hard uncle na 88m fan noon na tumabi sakin. sabi niya ""don't worry parehas tayo ng iboboto."" kaya na shook ako tas niyakap ko siya ng tumatawa ako in front of other members na will vote 88m. hoping na this 1 or 2 votes that i was able to gain helped leni tomorrow.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ul5cy6/my_personal_story_of_sadness_and_hope/,8 05 2022

Sabi sa akin ng Ante ko ay hindi ako tunay na Engineer dahil walang board exam yung couse ko.,"(***aita for arguing with my boomer aunt over the fact that she claimed i wasn't a true engineer and devalued my nearly three years of work experience in the logistics and supply chain industry by indicating it wasn't profitable****)*. &#x200b; minsan na rin ba kayong binansagang '**bastos**' ng mga nakakatanda na sarado ang isipan sa mga bagay-bagay dahil nagbibigay ka ng mga punto patungkol sa mga karanasan na **mas** alam mo dahil hindi nila naranasan? ako kasi, oo. si ante (**auntie**) ay kilala naming relihiyoso, palasimba at masasabi mo na kapag gumuho ang mundo ay talagang malabo na mapunta sa impyerno dahil halos tatlong beses sa isang araw kung magrosaryo. isa siyang dh sa hong kong at isa namang assistant sa isang simbahang katoliko kada rest day niya. mataas ang respeto ko kay ante dahil sa hirap ng buhay ay nagawa nila ni tatay (nakababatang kapatid ni ante) noon na makapunta sa abroad para magtrabaho. marami na ring naipundar at nakapagpagawa ng bahay. ako naman ay isang simpleng tao lang, nagtapos ako ng kursong **industrial engineer** sa isang kilalang unibersidad sa luzon. bata pa lang kasi ako noon, sobrang naeengganyo ako magbyahe-byahe at maghahatid ng pagkain ng tatay at kuya ko kapag sila ay nasa bukid - masasabi ko na isa ito sa konsepto kung bakit ko pinili manatili at magtrabaho sa industriya ng logistics at supply chain. at noong nagtapos ako sa kolehiyo, ang una kong trabaho ay qc (quality control) engineer sa isang manufacturing company sa valenzuela. ngunit sa sobrang boring ng trabaho ay napilitan ako magresign at pinilit maghanap ng logistics o supply chain company at sa awa ng diyos ay nakahanap naman. dito, masasabi kong masakit sa ulo kasi madami kang kakausaping tao, dapat marunong ka magmando ng operations, magbigay ng tamang update kada oras at magbigay ng assurance sa mga business partners para mapanatili ang maayos na samahan. **maliit ang sahod?** oo. **masaya ba ako?** sobra. nagumpisa ang pangyayari sa pagtawag ko sa ante ko dahil gusto ko siya kumustahin. labis-labis ang pagkamiss ko sa kanya dahil mula ng 2020 ay hindi na siya nakauwi pa ng pilipinas dulot ng covid-19. bandang alas-siyete ng gabi noong october 30 ay napatawag ako. pagkasagot ng tawag, iniisip ko na bubungad sa akin yung linya niya lagi na ""hello, how are you?"" pero hindi, sermon kaagad. mga limang minuto ng paguusap namin ay patungkol sa pinsan ko na nakapag-abroad na at nagtapos bilang nurse at sa isang kakilala namin na masasabi kong marami ng work experience bilang mechanical engineer at 'board passer'. pagkwento niya ay hindi ko maiwasan na hindi maging komportable lalo na't palaging binabanggit na walang board exam ang ie o di kaya maliit lang daw ang sahod ng mga ie. ang tawag pa nga niya sa akin minsan ay **rider** o **delivery boy** kasi ang madalas kong sabihin ay nagtatrabaho ako sa industriya ng logistics at supply chain - at dahil hindi niya alam ang sinasabi ko, ginamit ko ang katagang '*nagpapadedeliver ng mga produkto sa mga mall, tindahan o warehouse*' para madali niya maintindihan yung konspeto ng trabaho ko. nabanggit pa nga na walang pera sa trabaho ko kahit pa pausbong pa lang ako sa sa professional career (almost 3 years work experience) ko at hindi ko nagustuhan ang mga sinabi - na hindi ako tunay na engineer dahil wala akong board exam. pinupunto ko sa kanya na kahit wala kang board exam ay pwede ka pa ring maging engineer. dito pa lang ay nagtataasan na kami ng boses. pinipilit pa rin na pumunta lang daw ako sa ie na course dahil takot ako sa board exam. nabanggit pa niya na hindi siya gaanong proud kasi hindi kilala yung course at hindi ganon katunog. binigyan ko ulit ng isa pang punto na sobrang importante ng mge ie sa mga kumpanya dahil kami ang nagaayos ng mga proseso. makaraang sinabi ko ito, binansagang na akong 'bastos', 'palasumbat' ni ante sabay binabaan ng tawag. sa tawag din ay kinukumpara niya ako dun sa kakilala namin na marami ng nabiling lupa, sasakyan. take note, almost 25 years na nagtatrabaho iyon compare sa akin na magtatatlong taon pa lang. ang iniisip ko ngayon, ako nga ba talaga itong bastos o palasumbat dahil pinili ko magreason-out regarding sa course ko at maging sa trabaho ko?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/yjcckq/sabi_sa_akin_ng_ante_ko_ay_hindi_ako_tunay_na/,1 11 2022
Sino ang mas kawawa? Magulang o Anak?,"i agree: 1. both biktima ng sistema ng lipunan o ng kultura ng kahirapan 2. both pwedeng magkamali sa desisyon sa buhay 3. both biktima ng pagpapasa ng kultura 4. both merong utak at puso na pwedeng magkamali. i cannot put it into words dahil sobrang personal sa akin neto pero tanong ko lang sa magulang dito o magbabalak mag anak sino ba ang mas kawawa ang magulang or anak? kapag nag desisyon na bumuhay ng bata ang isang couple, automatically magulang na sila, whether they are capable or not, they decided to have a child. pero sa lipunan nating ito, laging talo ang anak. wala namang kamuwang muwang ang bata at higit sa lahat hindi namilit na buhayin sa mundong ito, magulang ang nag desisyon na mag anak pero bakit sila pa din ang kawawa? kawawa sila palagi lalo na sa media portrayal kaya lahat tayo na condition na ganon, laging superior ang magulang sa lahat ng bagay, lagi silang kawawa, lagi silang dapat intindihin, lagi sila dapat bigyan ng pagmamahal, hindi ko maintindihan. nakaka awa lang na hanggang ngayon hindi pa rin mabago yan, example na lang sa mini miss u, may mga bata na naaawa sa magulang nila dahil napapagod magtrabaho, gusto na nilang magtrabaho para makatulong sa magulang nila, hindi ba nakaka gago yun na ipinapakita nila sa anak nila na napapagod sila dahil sa anak nila??? na iniisip ng bata na pabigat sila sa magulang nila??? eh hindi naman ang bata ang nag desisyon na mabuhay siya sa mundong ito kundi ang magulang niya? oo na sige na, sistema na may problema pero maaayos ba agad yan? wala bang mga utak o puso ang mga magulang na ito para maisip nila na desisyon nila mag anak pero pinaparamdam o pinapakita nila sa anak nila na mahirap mabuhay dahil sa anak nila? ang anak laging masama ang edit kapag ka humiwalay, nag decide magpamilya , inuna ang sarili, laging susumbatan ng magulang na pinakain, pinalaki sila neto , pinag aral — eh aba dapat lang kasi responsibilidad mo yun bilang magulang? bakit ganyan yung ibang magulang parang nag anak lang para pagkakitaan o para may mag alaga sa kanila sa pag tanda. hindi ba may buhay din yang mga anak? bakit laging kawawa ang mga magulang??? in the first place naman sila nag decide na bumuhay ng bata, kung nahihirapan sila consequence na yun ng desisyon nila? para sa akin, tama na yang paawa edit, kasalanan mo yan kasi nag anak ka?? hindi ko magets yung edit sa media, na parang utang na loob pa ng bata na nabuhay siya, na parang pinilit niya yung magulang na ipanganak siya?? nag anak lang ba ang mga magulang kasi wala silang pangarap sa buhay? nag anak lang ba sila para may mag alaga sa kanila? nag anak lang ba sila dahil sa pressure ng lipunan? pero isa pa rin yang desisyon? at kung ano mang consequence niyan e own up to it?? hindi yung papaawa ka sa ibang tao, sa tv shows, sa radio shows at maski sa harap ng anak mo para magkaroon ng utang na loob sayo at maawa sayo? hindi ko siya maput into words dahil nga personal kong na experience to e , yung pag mamanipula ng magulang, yung pagpaparamdam sa akin na kasalanan ko kung bakit nahihirapan sila, kasalanan ko kung bakit wala kaming makaen, pisikal at verbal abuse ang naranasan ko masakit man o hindi abuso yun para sa akin , at naranasan ko lahat ito mula bata hanggang sa paglaki, nakwento ko na din to sa mga close friends ko pero para sa kanila normal lang daw yun kaya naisantabi ko yung feelings ko. normal na pala na matawag na palamunin kahit bata ka palang. kaya nung nagkatrabaho ako, sobrang saya ko na makatulong pero nung may nabasa ako somewhere dun ako nagising sa katotohanan na, hindi ko dapat naranasan yun kasi bata lang ako that time. umiiyak ako habang tinatype to, si oa pala to eh haha. tumigil sa pagtatrabaho yung tatay ko nung nagkatrabaho na ako, edi malamang ako na naging breadwinner malamang sa malamang di lang ako nakakaranas neto, kaya nung nagising ako dun na bumalik lahat ng alaala ko nung bata ako, na akala ko normal lang yun pala hindi. hindi dapat. tumutulong ako kasi walang choice, kung hindi ako tutulong walang tutulong sa kanila kasi hindi na bila kaya tulungan sarili nila. o diba kawawa na naman sila. pero kelan magiging kawawa ang mga anak na nagsantabi ng pangarap sa buhay, ng oras, ng pamumuhay magisa, ng pagkakaroon ng karanasan katulad ng mga taong may matitinong magulang, kelannn??? hindi lang ako nakaranas neto dahil sigurado ako marami ding naging forced na maging breadwinner sila pero lagi pa ding kawawa edit ang mga magulang sa media portrayal, maski sa lipunan natin, kelan magkakaroon ng narrative na ""ayan anak pa more, alam mong hindi mo kaya nag anak ka pa, ngayon papa awa kang nahihirapan"" like.... hindi pa ba abuso na bubuo ka ng anak knowing na hindi mo kaya?... sa lipunang ito, sa ekonomiyang ito? nakakasawa na at lubos na nakakalungkot makarinig sa mga bata sa tv na kaya sila sumasali sa contest para makatulong sa magulang. hindi ba nahiya tong mga magulang na pinapakita nila sa mga bata yung paghihirap nila? fcking fake it. maawa ka sa bata, ipinaparamdam mo na mahirap ang buhay dahil sa kanya, at kelangan ka bigyan ng award dahil sa paghihirap mo, eh kung pwede namang hindi ka mahirapan kung hindi ka nag decide mag anak. gets ko na may problema sa sistema, pero maaayos banagad yan? hindi talaga pwede sisihin yung magulang sa desisyon nila? nakakainis yung ibang pa woke sa twitter na sasabihin na problema sa sistema yan kaya ganyan ang mga magulang? like so okay lang mang abuso kasi kasalanan ng sistema, hindi talaga sila pwede sisihin sa katangahang desisyon na ginawa nila???? ewan ko, mapa media, mapa woke. laging kawawa ang magulang , laging kelangan may bigger understanding ang mga anak sa magulang ""hindi mo maiintindihan kasi hindi ka pa nagiging magulang"" like bitch may utak ako and i'm in the right mind not to have a child knowing na im not financially capable para buhayin sila i can only speak for myself, for what i experienced, kung ano nakikita ko sa tv at kung ano response ng kaibigan ko sa karanasan ko, and by all of that, it only means na normal lang to pero hindi talaga dapat siya normal. tl;dr media portrayal affects the thinking of filipinos na nakaka awa ang magulang and it is love to be abusive towards children na forced sila to be a breadwinner and maging caregiver sa magulang dahil sa reponsibilities ng magulang masked as sacrifices. this normalizes the abusive culture at dynamics ng magulang at ng anak. hindi nakaka awa ang mga magulang, desisyon nilang mag anak kaya kung mahirapan man sila dapat di sila mag pa awa. mas nakaka awa ang mga anak na hindi naman nila desisyong mabuhay pero mag susuffer sila sa lipunang ito dahil sa desisyon ng magulang nila. knowing this, sino ang mas nakaka awa?

Recalibrating the Pink campaign.,"it is exhausting and emotionally draining, i know. okay let me dump all my thoughts here for all of the pinks who wish to turn the tide. * **intensify content creation.** we are doing decently on facebook and just need to keep on going. s**hare caravan moments, debate highlights, anecdotes, pink tiktoks, etc.** on tiktok we are doing fine but still not enough, so i am pleading to the pink tiktokers to vigorously combat the algorithm. on youtube, we are losing. compare the amount of pink content to the myriad of fringe conspiracies and fake news propagated with it's clickbait (and oftentimes tacky) thumbnails and titles on the site, it is tough. dahil mas matrabaho ang gumawa ng 3+ min yt content kaysa mga 1 min (average) tiktoks. * **continue the show of force.** if you can go to a caravan near you, **go** (with safety in mind). always challenge the bandwagon. we are a race of sore losers kaya mahilig tayong tumaya sa mananalo at matindi magreact pag hindi. beauty contests, basketball, boxing, you name some event that involves a ton of pride. **stay unbothered and be yourself in these caravans.** utilize the fomo feeling to break the bandwagon by having fun while being a civic participant. * **take surveys as it is, snapshots.** not implying causation here, but survey releases often coincides with the ""victories"" of the pink camp. never dismiss the survey without checking its credibility and time frame and learning what we can from the results. this is a psych war, given how many of us are emotionally invested with making our candidate emerge as the winner. kaya when these results come to rain on our parade, **bend but never break**. * **begin engaging on the ground with common unities.** the elections are very polarizing and we lose the listener kapag nauna agad yung personality. **be a calm, collected, respectful, listener when we engage with non-supporters**. ask them ano ba ang hinahanap nila sa lider, ano yung mga issue na gusto mong pagtuunan ng kandidato, and then proceed kung may plano ba yung napipisil niya. use the clearbook method if you will. we know napakahirap magconvert ng bbm to leni, but possible siya with persistence. however, if you can sense the misogyny, use that to our advantage (it's wrong i know, but again its a psych war din) by shifting them away from bbm to isko. * **when online, know your battles.** unlike sa ground, mas capable tayo of behaving badly due to the anonymity. **stay on the line of reason and truth.** trolls can be either extremely rabid (threats) or extremely passive (i was a leni eme but now i am bbm). ilugar ang approach sa mga ito but **never shame them (kahit repleksyon ng moralidad ang kanilang choice)**. very misplaced ang anger nila, thus the boogeyman dilawan and the red-tagging tendency. never use academic credentials to immediately dismiss the other. masakit masabihan ka ng mali dahil ugali natin ay may tendency maging mapagmataas. feel free to add more here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/t3cph8/recalibrating_the_pink_campaign/,28 02 2022

Wala na akong ibang magawa kundi magmahal nalang.,"alam kong masakit isipin na hindi natin nakamit ang nag-iisang liwanag sa lahat ng naglalakihang mga haligi na tumatakip sa sinag ng araw. pero hindi ko magawang magalit sa mga bagay na pinapayagan na ito ay mangyari. bayan ko. bayan kong minamahal. bakit ang hirap mong ipaglaban? uhaw na uhaw na tayo sa magandang kinabukasan ngunit tayo mismo ang naghahadlang sa ating sarili. lahat tayo ay naghahanap ng magandang kinabukasan, pero sana naman yung kinabukasan na tinatanaw natin ay para sa lahat at hindi para sa sariling interes lamang. bayan ko. bigo na naman tayo, at sigurado ako na sa susunod na labanan ay bigo pa rin tayo pangkat katangian natin ang pumapanig sa matatamis na kasinungalingan at hindi sa masasakit na katotohanan. mahirap na, mahirap na ipagmamalaki ang pagiging isang pilipino, ngunit sa lahat na ito hindi ko pa magawa na magalit at mag-iipon ng poot. pumapanig ako noon sa pinuno na gumagamit ng dahas at kalupitan. galit ang naging puhunan upang ako ay mapunta sa maling kaisipan. sinusuportahan ko ang mga tao na naging dahilan kung bakit tayo ay nananatiling bagsak sa kabila ng lahat ng lahat ng pagsisikap. ako mismo ang naging instrumento at galit ang naging sandata. kung saan sila galit, ako ay galit din. panatiko, nakakadiri ngunit ipinagmalaki ko na ako'y galit para sa kanila. hindi ako nararapat na mapatawad sa mga pag-iisip ko noon, ngunit sisikapin ko na ang mga huling dugtong ng buhay ko ay puno ng kabutihan. hindi pa ako sigurado noon na ang nag-iisang babae ay nararapat na maupo bilang susunod na pinuno. ngunit nang nakita ko ang pagmamahal na dala niya ay ako'y naakit. hindi ko inaasahan na dito ko mismo makikita ang bayanihan na pinagmamalaki natin mga pilipino ngunit hindi ko kailanman nakikita sa labas ng libro. hindi ko inaasahan na tayo ay nagtulong-tulongan bilang isang bansa para sa bansa. hindi ko inaasahan na dito ko makikita ang pagmamahal pilipino sa pilipino na hindi ko man lang nararanasan sa sarili kong pamilya. ang pagtindig natin ay pinaka importanteng ganap sa buhay ko. dahil dito alam ko na. alam ko na ang gagawin ko. bigo man makatangap ng matamis na tagumpay, ngunit sa pagtindig natin ay nakikita ko ang kislap ng pag-asa. at sigurado ako, ito palang ang simula. may magandang pagtingin sa hinaharap. ayaw ko nang magalit, kahit anong gawin ko hindi ako nagagalit sa resulta ng pagpili ng mga pilipino. ayaw ko nang magalit, ayaw ko na balikan ang galit ng aking nakaraan. bayan. bayan ko. bayan kong minamahal. ang hirap mong ipaglaban. bayan ko. kung ayaw mo pa ngayon, balang araw ako ay haharap.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/um5n08/wala_na_akong_ibang_magawa_kundi_magmahal_nalang/,10 05 2022
Deeply hurt and disappointed,"long rant ahead. sorry, just had to get this off my chest. i've never been invested in politics until this election season. isa ako sa mga walang pake dati. this was until nagannounce si vp na tatakbo siya. di ko alam bakit pero ilang beses ako naiyak while watching her speech. mas naiyak pa ko lalo nung nakita ko yung overwhelming support that poured online that day. nagulat ako kasi i'm aware of how much she's been vilified for the past years. so it was a pleasant surprise to see suddenly almost everyone i know expressing support. tapos nagtuloy tuloy na. dumami ng dumami yung mga tumitindig. padami ng padami yung mga sumasali sa rallies. yung mga kilala kong apolitical din started to make a stand. sobrang saya ko nun kasi akala ko finally, natauhan na tayo lahat. ayaw na natin sa nakasanayan natin na hirap, gusto na natin ng tunay na pagbabago. i trust the science of the surveys pero naniniwala ako na may milagro pa na pwede mangyari to make vp win. after all, ngayon lang natin nakita ung ganitong level of engagement from the common filipino. kumilos ang mga tao on a scale na hindi pa natin nakita before. nagsipag din naman ang team nila vp. ginawa nila lahat ng pwede. so for me, napakaunfair ng mundo naman if at the end of it all, all the hard work, passion and dedication, those efforts won't be rewarded, especially if it's for the good of everyone. pero sadly, that's not how the world works. ang sakit. nakakatakot. nakakabahala. it's very selfish to say but i feel i've been betrayed by my fellow countrymen. ako at lahat ng tumindig para sa bansa at para din naman sa kanila. basta masakit hahaha anyway, as vp (but to me, the president) said during her mda speech, ""ang minsan nang namulat, hinding-hindi na ulit mapipikit "", this election has changed me forever. and for that, i'm very grateful. i'm sure i'm not the only one. sana lahat tayo handa pa rin ipaglaban ang mga dapat ipaglaban sa mga susunod na taon.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ulsk0e/deeply_hurt_and_disappointed/,9 05 2022
A Love Letter to BBM Supporters- something we can try?,"base sa survey data, the only way for vp leni to win is to get voters from bbm. konti na lang ang undecided at konti rin lang ang macoconvert from the rest of the candidates. can't emphasize this enough but we really need bbm supporters, even the hardcore ones, on our side. so can we make our campaign directed towards bbm supporters? not by showcasing vp leni's gazillion accomplishments, they're not gonna want to see that, but a campaign that feels like a love letter to them? of course, it can be only successful if we actually manage to understand them. otherwise, magiging cringe yan like other politicians' attempts to seem like they understand their voters. dapat genuine talaga. pag may konting bahid ng condescension, ekis agad yan. pag may parang sinasabing mali ang napupusuan nila or nabiktima lang sila ng fake news o ng corrupt sistema, ekis din agad yan. masakit na masabihan na mali ka kahit sa anong paraan sinabi. pwedeng may message din galing mismo kay vp leni for them. something that a parent would lovingly say to their children. at dahil genuine naman talaga si vp leni, i think she can pull this off. the goal is not to make them realize that they were wrong but only to make them feel understood. duterte managed to do that in 2016 with the millions of filipinos underserved by the aquino administration na hindi naman maramdaman yung taon-taong gdp growth. kahit yun lang. maramdaman lang nila na totoong naiintindihan sila ni vp leni. walang cliche na mga statements, good example is how duterte managed to appear genuine kasi iba siya magsalita sa mga nakasanayan ng pulitiko that time. that'd be a good start already for them to go seek vp leni of their own accord, as opposed to tinambakan lang ng facts at mga resibo. they should take the first step themselves towards vp leni themselves. ayaw natin ng pinapangunahan tayo. hope we can also refrain from making posts/comments mocking bbm kasi yung mga supporters ang nasasaktan, not bbm. instead of seeing that they're wrong they feel insulted kasi we have insulted their choice/decision-making process so nagiging defensive sila. hindi naman lahat ng kakampinks ang gumagawa niyan, yung iba lang, kasali na ako dun. nalinawan lang ako after having a long pero medyo maayos na facebook comments sagutan with a bbm supporter. hindi ko rin alam kung paano gagawin yan, pero buti na lang, maraming creative at magagaling na mga kakampinks. we really need bbm supporters on our side. buti na lang din at halos lahat naman siguro ng bbm supporters, gusto lang din maging maayos ang pilipinas, iba nga lang ang nakitaan nila ng solusyon. meaning, may pag-asang mag-shift sila to vp leni. patunay diyan ang maraming-maraming mga ex-dds or ex-bbm supporters na lumipat na kay vp leni. may pag-asa pa talaga pero kailangan natin itong pagtrabahuhan. remember, the truth is on our side and leni robredo is the real deal. mas mahirap ang ginagawa ng kalaban trying to bend reality and selling a defective product pero they have a highly paid, focused team working on it. pero together, united, we can do things they can never do kahit gaano pa karaming pera ang itapal nila which we proved with our big and getting even bigger rallies. pero kulang yun, kasi may counterattack na ang kalaban by spreading even more lies about the rallies. we need to do more if we want to win. kaya magtipon, mag-usap, at kumilos na tayo.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/tkd4sq/a_love_letter_to_bbm_supporters_something_we_can/,22 03 2022

Kwentong Covid ni Lanie Magdurulan,"“ako po si lani magdurulan. may apat akong anak. dalawa na lang ang natira. masakit sa akin iyon, lalo na ngayong pandemic, wala na yung isa kong anak na babae. noong october 4, dinala ko siya sa ospital pero nag-aagaw-buhay na siya. ayaw siyang tanggapin sa ospital kasi raw may covid. matagal kami sa labas ng ospital. kasama niya yung asawa niya noon. ayaw siyang tanggapin. eh, wala naming covid yung anak ko kasi nga, nabinat ata yon o lumaki yung puso. pero wala yong covid. . . nagtitinda ako ng biscuits dito sa cavite, kasi gusto kong malibang. kasi pag nandito ako sa bahay, lagi na lang akong umiiyak. gusto kong malibang yung sarili ko. kahit nga umuulan, naglalakad ako, nagpapayong ako, nagdedeliver ako. andami ngang naaawa sakin, sabi nila, “wag na po kayong lumabas, kami na po ang pupunta sa bahay niyo, kasi kawawa naman kayo. nababasa na nga kayo ng ulan, puro putik pa.” sagot ko naman sa kanila, “masaya naman ako sa ginagawa ko. kasi nga, dito ako lumiligaya na naglalakad, nalilibang ko ang sarili ko kaysa naman andito ako sa bahay, umiiyak ako. lagi akong umiiyak, luhaan, kasi maiisip ko yung nawala kong anak. dalawang buwan pa lang siyang nawawala. . . ang mga anak ko ang kinikuhanan ko ng lakas ng loob. laging anak. yun ang pampatibay saking loob na maging strong ako. pati mga apo. gusto ko pang mabuhay nang dahil sa kanila. ang sabi ko nga, “sama-sama na lang tayo kasi konti na lang kami. ang gusto ko sa nalalabing araw ng buhay ko, sama-sama na lang kami.” ayaw ko ng hiwa-hiwalay dahil ang lungkot ng buhay. malungkot mag-isa. masakit. wala ka man lang makaramay, matanungan, o masabihan pag may problema ka. wala. kaya pinapauwi ko na siya para sama-sama na kami, kaya nakiusap ako sa manager na lipat nalang siya sa manila para mas malapit. para sama-sama kami. . . mahirap ang buhay. mahirap kumilos kasi mahirap lumabas dahil sa covid. mahirap magtrabaho. mahirap maghanapbuhay. kaya sa lahat, sumunod sa patakaran ng gobyerno. magsuot ng mask para iwas sa covid. at unang una rin, magpray lagi kay god. lahat ng tao ay may pag-asa talaga. pero sa gaya naming mahihirap, kailangang magsumikap para mabuhay sa mundo para may pambili ng pangangailangan, lalong lalo na ng pagkain. lumaban lang tayo sa buhay.” ""ikaw, ano'ng kwentong covid mo?"" #kwentongcovid",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/jti3kx/kwentong_covid_ni_lanie_magdurulan/,13 11 2020

Seriously.,"#1) robin premise i've seen people criticize the choice of robin padilla, which is understandable. and no way am i a simp for this guy (i hate machismo culture), but his [platforms](https://votepilipinas.com/candidate/padilla-robin.html) in the given site are actually more comprehensive than 88m's lmao. a lot of them are broad statements, but it's going to be *very effective*. why? because he's a celebrity. one thing this election has taught us is **filipinos love celebrities**, likely even more than actual policies. they recognize a name and they *will* vote for them and their whole family. robin padilla gained a lot of votes even from leni supporters based from the transparency votes. let not the echo chambers convince you that people didn't vote for him because they thought he would be a legit good candidate. mabait, gwapo, may dating, astig, ~~seeeeegggsss~~... all of these aspects are *appealing* and most of all, **charismatic**. you know who capitalized on that very well? duterte. no way is robin going to be another duterte, but he's another icon of the masses, and you would be coping at this point if you disagree. #2) influence of celebrities take the previously mentioned platforms of robin padilla. ^(seriously, look at it. you're a redditor, you can read articles out of boredom.) celebrities can reach the masses and make them understand the core aspects of most issues. best of all, they appeal to emotion and attention, keeping their audiences interested and glued to their words. there's also a nuance here that will beat a nefarious system that the corrupt political dynasties clearly want to proliferate: dictatorship. to be more broad, a king. a leader who will only throw orders that the loyalists will follow without question. wait, why celebrities? because celebrities encourage people to act and feel the filipino spirit in whatever field they act in. ignore all political affiliations for now... willie revillame with the presentation of sob stories in his game shows, encouraging filipinos to have more compassion towards others. manny pacquiao na kayang umahon sa kahirapan at pagsikapang mag-aral na may puso sa bayan. miss universe for international recognitions, na may poise and grace in words. even for the mu seasons alone, you would see people engrossed in their screens, and maybe try to impersonate the candidates. character. beauty. impressions. at least, these would all be values that would not encourage filipinos to stay still in their homes. **they would want to be their idols**, even in the smallest of ways. much better than taking a role model out of a political family's son's and daughters. to clarify, hindi sila yung specifically sinusuggest ko. just an idea on what celebrity culture instills on the filipino people. although manny is certainly an option at this point... #3) fake news, education, viability credentials? we've seen the majority of filipinos do **not** care about those. charisma? now, that's the good shit. now, you can say that 88m doesn't have charisma - and i'll be the first one to agree with full contempt - but he has a family name. it carries him through the alamanos and moments where he actively evades supporters themselves. most of all, he has a system of disinformation propping him up. what can good ol' tv show celebrities do in this case? just speak honestly. fake news? filipinos voted for robin because he's handsome. filipinos can forget martial law atrocities because they can recognize a name (this is a case distinct from martial law *deniers* by the way, primarily because the bad education in the country allows it). what can be thrown at celebrities? fake news. what would filipinos say? ""mabait naman yan nung nasa tv show niya."" ""nakakatawa kaya siya. kesa yung mga elitista hindi naman kilala ang pinoy."" *even 88m who cannot even accurately tell the fare of daily commute* was branded as someone who represent the masses. laughable, i know, but it's the horrible reality we live in now. celebrities already start at great footing, and the opposition can do well to capitalize on a culture that **treats elections like a betting game.** for the last time, credentials? let celebrities step up, and have them hire lawyers in the background. a lot of celebrities have already been vocal about important issues, regardless of affiliations, and the filipino people will listen to them over politicians they deem ""elitists"". #4) others ang radikal na pagmamahal ay walang dating sa masa. masakit. lalo na't tayo pa ngayon ang iniikutan ng mga scripts na tayo pa ang nasama, gayong tayo ang nag-effort na maging mabubuti at **mapagpasensyang** mga mamamayan. pero the moment na tayo ang pumatol sa mga kabastusan nila, tayo pa ang naging problema. mga duwag ang mga loyalista. pero *may malaking bahagi ng masa ang walang pakialam sa drama natin online*. naaabutan pa rin sila ng mga celebrities. ganyan kultura sa pilipinas. it's about time the opposition facilitates change through that. stop proposing idealistic solutions like ""better governance"". **filipinos don't want candidates with good morals, they want someone with a good image.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/unovdt/the_opposition_should_elect_celebrities_seriously/,12 05 2022
Valentines Break Up,"yung iba siguro excited mag valentines, lalo na mga may jowa. samantalang ako, i'm waiting for valentines for the official break up of me and my boyfriend. sa totoo lang ang tagal ko na nakikipagbreak sa boyfriend ko kaso hindi siya pumapayag. this time, ayoko na talaga, ang dami ko na nasasabi na masakit na salita, nagrequest lang siya na paabutin ko man lang sa birthday nya which is february 13. syempre alam ko curious kayo bakit? ano bang nangyari? actually, kaya rin ako nagpopost dito para humingi ng opinion. bago pa kami magkakilala ng boyfriend ko, kilala na siya sa pagiging loko-loko, lalo na sa pagweweed. literal na bad boy na aayawan ng typical na magulang (pero hindi naman mukhang adik, he's good looking lol). so ayon cut ko na lang yung kadramahan sa first few months ng relationship namin. nagbago naman siya, or that's what i thought. lagi kami nag-aaway dahil may nababasa ako sa messenger nya about marijuana, keso sa kumukuha si ganyan sa kanya, nagtatanong ganto. umamin na rin siya sakin na he smoked weed twice while we are in a relationship. una pa lang naman sinabi ko sa kanya na malaman ko lang isang beses na bumalik siya sa pag gaganon, hihiwalayan ko siya. pero ayon marupok si ate mo girl, umabot pa ng pangalawa or baka lima hindi lang nya sinasabi. bukod sa marijuana, pinag-aawayan talaga namin pagiging sinungaling nya, as in huli mo na nga, may ebidensya na, itatanggi pa at iibahin ang istorya. tangina naman ganyan ba kayong mga lalaki lols. last year, december hindi na rin kami okay dahil nanaman sa mga nababasa ko sa messenger nya, alam nyo yung nawalan na ako ng tiwala sa kanya to the point na wala na akong amor sa kanya. sabi ko nga sa kanya plano ko bago sana mag 2021, magbreak na kami kasi tangina paulit-ulit na lang hanggang sa ayan ayaw nya iyak iyak magbabago nanaman. lumipas ilang bwan okay nanaman kami, hanggang sa netong feb, may nabasa nanaman ako na nagtatanong siya kung may available na weed. may nagpapatanong lang daw sa kanya na kaibigan. ang pangit pa kasi dun, nagdedelete siya tapos chinat nya ung kausap nya na magchat ulit sila ganyan, para bang gumawa sila ng bagong convo ulit para mapakita na nagtatanong siya para sa kaibigan nya. eh alam ko na iba na un kasi di naman yun yung nabasa ko nung una. nakakagigil diba ginagawa pa akong tanga. pinipilit nya na ano ba masama sa marijuana, importante raw hindi na siya gumagamit, tinutulungan nya lang mga kaibigan nya pag naghahanap. sige may point siguro na tangina herbal yan, natural pero ang sakin naman kasi, illegal yon! pwede siya mapahamak at ako, kung hindi nya kaya i-adjust yon at tuluyan alisin sa buhay nya, edi sana humanap siya ng iba na kaya mag-adjust para sa kanya kasi di ko naman pinagsisiksikan sarili ko sa kanya. are my reasons petty? or i should have broke up with him the first time he broke my trust? yun lang di ko sure kung may magbabasa neto pero post ko na lang din kasi wala naman ako napag-oopenan ng tungkol sa relationship ko.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/lavdeu/valentines_break_up/,2 02 2021
"Sorry, but I think the internet is indeed a factor why many people are ""depressed"" right now, BUT that's not necessarily a bad thing.","so i saw this short clip on facebook. galing siya sa isang film featuring tony labrusca. tony told her mom he's depressed, and the mom went ballistic, saying shits like depression is just a trend online. while i don't believe that depression is a trend, i do think the internet is also a reason why more and more middle-class people claim they're depression. sa palagay ko, ito ay parehong panget at mabuti -- pero mas matimbang ang mabuti kesa panget. let's talk about why is it a bad thing first. simple lang: some people might misinterpret this validation, and rather than dealing with their pains, they became addicted to it and became their sort of comfort. kumbaga, the internet validation became a new form of addiction -- gaya ng kung bakit may mga nalululong sa online games, pagkain, at droga. i've observed this a lot in the west. halimbawa nga, some of them gets offended with the word ""fat"" or ""obese"". dapat daw plus-size or the new sexy ang tawag para di masakit sa pandinig. see? rather than dealing with their insecurity, they resorted to demonizing an adjective, and that's a bad thing. nagiging eggshell na ang mga tao, all for the sake of not offending someone who has issues. now, let's talk about the good thing. syempre, unang-una dyan ang validation ulit. gaya rin ng pagkain, online games, and even drugs, wala naman talagang masama sa validation *as long as* you know your limit. most of you probably already know sugar is addicting, and is probably more addicting than marijuana, but hey, we don't hear people asking to ban sugar. even nutritionists themselves aren't saying that. ang lagi lang nilang sinasabi ay hinay-hinay lang. if you consumed it moderately, sobrang helpful iyon sa katawan mo especially if you're physically active. ganoon din sa validation. maraming middle class/rich kid na lumaki sa toxic positivity mindset. because of this, their frustrations were forced to repress simply because someone had it worse. pinagdaanan ko rin ito, sa totoo lang. my grandma loves to tell me na swerte ako dahil marino si papa at malaki ang sahod kaya hindi ko naranasan maghirap noon. anong naging epekto sakin? i was forced to conceal my angsts. dahil hindi ko mailabas, naipon lang nang naipon sa dibdib ko. parang naging time bomb siya, and it exploded in 2019, after my break-up with my long-term boyfriend. i felt so miserable. i'm still dealing with numbness and suicidal ideation until now. mabuti na lang, i have a good support group. gusto ko sanang mag-therapy pero ayoko kasi ng epekto ng gamot sakin, so i chose not to seek it. what could have happened if iba ang upbringing ko? i probably would have a better coping mechanism. right now, my coping mechanism is being workaholic, since it helps me distract myself from pain, pero hindi rin maganda ito. dami ko ngang pera pero di naman ako masaya sa buhay ko. that's why right now, i'm learning to balance my social life and work. heck, pati sex life and fitness, i'm slowly incorporating it to my lifestyle. isa pang bagay na maganda sa awareness ng mental health online ay yung mapuputol na natin ang siklo. let's admit it, one of the reasons why the gen xers and the generation earlier romanticized hard work and abuses so much is because ganoon sila pinaniwala. kaya nga karamihan sa mga toxic boss at customer ay mga galing sa henerasyon na ito. karamihan sa kanila ay mayroong anger management issue. naalala ko nga sa first job ko, i was bullied by my workmates, who are mostly 40+ and older. natutuwa kasi boss namin sakin dahil mabilis ako magtrabaho, and these people saw me as a threat, so they're bullying me through cold treatment. tapos lagi pa akong pinagchichismisan, at hindi rin ako sinasabihan kapag may announcement. it’s affecting my job a lot. so iyon, umalis ako after six months. nagalit si tita ko sakin, saying i should just shrug it off. imagine, rather than saying ang toxic ng ka-work ko, ako pa ang mali? but then, iyon kasi ang kinagisnan nilang buhay. through the mh awareness, the younger generation can break this cycle. we learn to be kinder and be less tolerant to bullshit like this, and i think that’s the best part. after all, bukod sa mali naman talaga ang bullying, counterproductive din ito, lalo na sa office. halimbawa na nga lang itong experience ko sa first work ko. natutuwa si boss sakin because i’m efficient. that efficiency decreased because of the bullying. remember, from an economic perspective, productivity loss will also result in income loss, which sadly many insecure coworkers didn’t know. hindi lang ako ang apektado kundi ang kumpanyang pinagtratrabahuhan nila. in the long run, sila rin ang maapektuhan sa ganitong kultura. and speaking of efficiency, mh awareness also improves it. think about it: hindi ka makakapagtrabaho nang matino kung burnt out ka, hindi ba? and this is not just anecdotal evidence. years ago, microsoft japan conducted a study to know what would happen if they implement a 4-day work system. japan is notorious for their overworking culture, so this is frowned upon. and surprisingly, mas malaki pa ang income nila during the time 4-day work happens. mas productive ang mga tao dahil hindi sila masyadong pagod. hindi rin uso yung pinapabagal ang trabaho para lang mapagkasya ng eight hours ang pwede sanang gawin within 3-4 hour. and nakatipid pa sila sa operating expenses dahil tatlong araw na walang gumagamit ng office. see? efficient, and it all started because microsoft is trying to improve the mental health state of their employees. the verdict? the internet does play a factor on why more people are self-diagnosing. but if you think about it, the benefits outweigh the liability. hindi lang natin natutulungan ang mga tao, but it would also improve the economy. it’s a win-win suggestion. recommendation? normalize validating your pain, but don’t overdo it as it would lead to addiction in the long run.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/oco9gn/sorry_but_i_think_the_internet_is_indeed_a_factor/,3 07 2021
Duque waits for poop to hit his briefs before going to the toilet - Report,"*manila, philippines* \-- in a personal interview with department of health secretary francisco duque iii, he mentioned that he waits for his stool to hit his briefs before going to the toilet. ""*alam n'yo*, this is what i really do. doesn't matter if *masakit* na ang stomach *ko*, but unless *may konting tae na dumikit sa briefs ko*, i would never go to the cr,"" duque said, ""it has been my philosophy in life, to never think of contingencies."" bear in mind that duque refuses to impose a travel ban on countries with the new strain of covid-19. ""we need to wait for them to have a community transmission within their country before we impose a travel ban,"" duque added, ""this is despite the new strain being 56% to 70% more contagious, we need to wait for the community transmission."" ""we were successful early this year in imposing a timely travel ban, now we are the fastest to curb covid in asia,"" duque, again, contradicting data. ""*anong plan for the worst? dilawan ka siguro*,"" duque further added, after the news team noticed the stench of poop in the room. as of date, the philippines is still in lockdown with the first wave of covid-19. \------------------------------------------- *this is satire. any resemblance to persons, living or dead, is entirely coincidental or is intended purely as a satire.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/kl4i8i/duque_waits_for_poop_to_hit_his_briefs_before/,27 12 2020
Pet Euthanasia,"kindly asking kung may alam kayo na vet or clinic na pwede mag euthanize ng pet? my baby (4 month old puppy - turning 5 on dec 26) was diagnosed with two types of cancer. one is leukemia due to the large amount of white blood cells and increased number of neoplastic cells. then sabi ng vet positive din for another type of cancer found in her red blood cells. we fought hard to keep her alive (spent a good amount of money just to get her the meds and tests she needed) honestly, oo gusto ko padin sya mabuhay nang matagal but unfortunately the signs are not really good na. she's slowly loosing her appetite. i've been force feeding her since the first week of november pa. lagi nalang sya nakahiga. tatayo at lalakad lang sya pag pupunta ng training pad to pee and poop. loose nadin yung bowel movement nya and may traces of blood nadin sa stool. may times padin na nakikitaan namin sya ng will to live. pag kinaka usap namin sya, nag wa-wag padin yung tail nya. lumalaban yung isip nya. pero gusto na yata bumigay ng katawan nya. ayoko sana gawin to pero if needed, saan ako pwede magpa euthanize for my baby? ang hirap sabihin. ang hirap gawin. masakit. sobra. pero baka kailangan ko na na sya i-let go. my faith is being tested. this is unfair. i did everything to take good care of her. complete vaccines, complete deworming sessions. getting her all the stuffs she needed. di ko pa pinapalabas ng house due to fear of viruses pero bakit yung baby ko pa yung pinahirapan ng ganito. she doesn't deserve this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/k8yxtp/pet_euthanasia/,8 12 2020
Anybody who had anal fissure/hemorrhoids?,"i have anal fissure for over a year now. una medyo nakakatakot lang kasi nagulat nalang ako na may dugo sa dumi ko, but it was painless. so it just kept happening, theres a bit of blood outside especially over the tail end of the poop but since it was painless hinayaan ko nalang. (napapa kris aquino ako kasi nanlalambot ako pag naiisip ko to hihi). pero isang beses nung nagtubol talaga ako grabe ang sakit, simula noon lahat na ng pagtae ko ang hirap, talagang pagpapawisan at paghahandaan mo ang pagpunta sa cr para makapagipon ng lakas kasi sobrang sakit talaga. the pain would never end there because after i pooped i can never sit straight for hours because of how sore my a-hole was. the only thing i could to relax do was lie down straight. after weeks or months there were periods na nagheal and i think it was back to normal relax pooping and i was relieved, but dumating nanaman ung significant na tubol tapos nag recur nanaman yung blood, and i knew from myself that tomorrow is going to be the start of pain. indeed it was. i have not visited any doctor yet, but the first time i saw blood i didnt tell my parents first pero nung naging concerning na sa akin sinabi ko na, kahit alam kong grabe takot nila. i only searched google for everything about my situation. di ko nga sure kung fissure or hemorrhoids eh. (shocked tlaga sila, kasi may history ng colon cancer line ni papa, si lola namatay due to that) so yon, aside from the pain, there is also the problem of rectal discharge na para bang sinisipon yung pwet (lalo na kapag masakit after pooping magdidischarge talaga. so its been weeks now since i have last encountered blood on my poop. nitong mga recent aftermath ng handaan, wala ring blood (yay) but the pain doesnt end yet. for some reason if i soap my anal area, it stings. i dont know why because i cant see down there pero internal ang fissure dba? so sinearch ko, tumungkol naman sa hemorrhoid wag daw sabunin kasi ma iirritate. ibig sabihin hemorrhoid naman problema ko ngayon, or did i really had both all along? this really changed the game of going to the toilet for me. i can never experience the ""comfort"" in comfort room ever again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/krb2hz/anybody_who_had_anal_fissurehemorrhoids/,5 01 2021

of the jeepney phaseout issue is becoming worst day by day. hindi naman sya surprise, yet people are only resisting just now, bakit hindi kayo nagprotesta nung bill pa lang sya? anong nangyari sa loob ng 10+ years na pagsulong ng proyekto na ito, bakit walang ginawang counterproposal itong mga operators at jeepney drivers sa mga taong yun? bakit hindi sila nag-effort? now for better understanding and for those who claims na “agad-agad” daw yung project, well it’s not. it’s actually over a decade of urong-sulong because of the woke resistance: **january 4, 2016** – piston protested at the head office of the then-dotc. it wanted to make sure that the ltfrb and lto would accept the applications for registration of old jeepneys. former ltfrb chairperson winston ginez said a mandatory phaseout would begin in 2017. **(this was one of the earliest reports of cnn philippines about the matter. in 2012, the noynoy aquino administration pushed to introduce e-jeepneys. then-dotc secretary mar roxas said the age limits of puvs over time would be reduced. media reports said the phaseout plan has been issued by the dotc since 2002 but it was not seriously implemented.)** **september 21, 2016** – jeepney operators and drivers warned that they plan to hold a nationwide transport holiday if congress passed a bill that would approve the newly named department of transportation’s (dotr) plan to carry out the puv phaseout program, among other projects. the bill also pushed to give emergency powers to former president rodrigo duterte to solve the transport crisis. **february 6, 2017** – the stop and go coalition called for a nationwide transport strike, the first of many. it affected thousands of passengers and forced the cities of manila and malabon to suspend work and classes. it ended after the ltfrb called for a dialogue. the transport groups were reportedly unsatisfied with its results. **february 27, 2017** – the leaders of transport groups piston, stop and go coalition, and no to jeepney phase out coalition (njpoc) staged another nationwide strike, as a response to the government’s inaction to their appeal to amend the modernization program. some local government units in luzon and the visayas suspended classes, with malacañang also announcing a class suspension for metro manila on the eve of the strike. **june 19, 2017** – the ltfrb announced that the puv modernization program would start after a month under its order called omnibus franchising guidelines. aside from the phaseout, the program would stop giving franchises to single-unit operators. it was also reported that the government-affiliated land bank of the philippines had put up a ₱1-billion credit facility to cover the replacement of some 650 jeepneys, which would cost from around ₱1.4 million to ₱1.6 million per unit. days later, the department of trade and industry released possible designs for a prototype of the modern jeepney. after a few months, transport officials said that by 2020, all puvs would be modernized. **october 16-17, 2017** – jeepney drivers and operators led by piston staged another nationwide strike. the ltfrb claimed it received reports that it was part of a destabilization plot but the group denied the allegation. the ltfrb warned that it would cancel the franchises of operators who participated in the strike. traffic enforcers took photos of drivers who joined the protest, it added. during an event in camarines sur, duterte had some harsh words for members of piston and other protesters, warning them about serious consequences if they didn’t join the program. **december 5, 2017** – george san mateo, piston’s national president at that time, posted bail after he was arrested on dec. 1 for violating the commonwealth act no. 146, or the public service law. the case stemmed from the february piston-led strike. **december 11, 2017** – the senate committee on public service, led by sen. grace poe, conducted a hearing on the puv modernization program. poe said the ₱80,000 subsidy would not be enough to assist jeepney drivers as modern jeepneys cost ₱1.6 million each. but according to her own computation, each unit would actually cost ₱2.1 million at a 6% interest rate per annum if the payment period was seven years. groups led by piston planned to stage a week-long transport strike but called it off because of the hearing. they mounted transport caravans instead. **january 2, 2018** – the dotr said old jeepneys must meet government requirements as determined by a motor vehicle inspection system (mvis), or a roadworthiness test, before they could resume plying their routes until 2020. the agency also said jeepney units must be replaced with euro-4 compliant engines. **january 8, 2018** – transport officials started its tanggal bulok, tanggal usok campaign, where they issued warnings to smoke-belching vehicles and temporary operator’s permits for vehicles with defective parts and accessories. a month later, they cracked down on jeepneys at the university of the philippines diliman and issued citations to 95 drivers. the surprise operation affected students, teachers and employees. the dotr deployed only 10 solar-powered jeepneys to the campus. **march 19, 2018** – the ltfrb released a memorandum circular telling individual operators to join a cooperative or corporation that would operate more than 15 units, or group themselves to form a single juridical entity, by march 2019. this started the industry consolidation component of the puv modernization program. **october 8, 2018** – in a senate hearing, the ltfrb said it will postpone the implementation of the total puv phaseout originally set for march 2019, following opposition from senators and transport groups. but days later, then-transportation secretary arturo tugade said they would continue with the modernization program. **july 15, 2019** – alliance of concerned transport organizations (acto) and piston staged a protest, warning of another nationwide strike if their calls were ignored. efren de luna, acto’s president at that time, said in an earlier forum that they were not against the program but the phaseout had to be gradual. **september 30, 2019** – ltfrb’s then-chief martin delgra said around 18,000 puv units nationwide, including 5,642 jeepneys, had complied with the modernization program. the government is looking to modernize around 170,000 units. he also said the transition phase of the program would end by june 2020. transport groups claimed a successful nationwide strike on the same day. acto’s de luna said nine out of 10 jeepneys in major cities participated in the protest action. delgra reportedly vowed they would proceed with the program. **march 2020** – the enhanced community quarantine (ecq) or a total lockdown was implemented in luzon because of the covid-19 pandemic, crippling the transport sector. **june 2020** – transport group federation of jeepney operators and drivers association of the philippines (fejodap) expressed concern the government would use the covid-19 pandemic as an excuse to phase out jeepneys, after modern jeepneys were prioritized over traditional jeepneys and uv express units to resume operations. in july, provisional authorities of puv operators were extended until dec. 31, 2020. **december 18, 2020** – the ltfrb extended the franchise consolidation deadline to march 31, 2021. **march 29, 2021** – the ltfrb extended the franchise consolidation deadline until the lifting of the ecq. in april, the board gave provisional authority to drivers and operators valid for a year. in december, it opened the application for operators plying routes that have yet to consolidate until march 2022. **march 25, 2022** – in a memorandum circular, the ltfrb said the provisional authorities for traditional jeepneys will be valid until march 2023, to give them time for franchise validation. in september, the board also extended the deadline for operators plying routes that have yet to consolidate. **february 21, 2023** – the ltfrb extended the deadline for the franchise consolidation until june 30, as ltfrb chief teofilo guadiz iii revealed only about 60% of traditional jeepneys had been modernized. **february 27, 2023** – manibela chairperson mar valbuena said around 100,000 drivers and operators would stage a week-long, nationwide strike on march 6 to pressure the ltfrb into suspending the mandatory consolidation. he reiterated calls that the program must be humane and reasonable, and for the vehicles to be locally made. **march 1, 2023** – president ferdinand marcos jr. urged drivers to cancel the strike but he stressed the need to implement the modernization program in a “different way.” it was the first time he shared his sentiments on the matter after winning the elections. during his campaign, marcos said the dotr should modernize puvs by inspecting the vehicles’ condition and not simply basing it on age. in the afternoon, the ltfrb announced the extension of the franchise consolidation deadline, now set until dec. 31, to give the transport sector “more time to consolidate.” but manibela’s valbuena said the strike would still push through. **march 2, 2023** – in a hearing, senators urged transport regulators to indefinitely postpone the deadline of the franchise consolidation. sen. poe noted that the national government itself is not yet ready to implement the puv modernization program. **march 6, 2023** – in anticipation of the possible effects of the transport strike, various cities and schools, mostly in metro manila, announced the shift to online and asynchronous classes. libreng sakay trips were also prepared. however, malacañang said many of the country's transport groups were not participating. **december 31, 2023** – this is the last day for drivers and operators to consolidate. **2024** – the second component of the puv modernization program will start. so sinong nagkulang? hindi totoong lahat ay pabor sa modernization, kagaya nung sinasabi nila. maraming jeepney drivers at operators ang ayaw talaga nito dahil hindi na nila magagawa yung mga kabalastugan na ginagawa nila noon. marami sa kanila ang may “pwede na yan, tumatakbo pa naman” mindset at ayaw mamuhunan dahil “nakasanayan” na. marami ding pasahero ayaw ng pagbabago dahil ayaw din nila gumastos o dahil kesyo kultura daw. adapt or die. we are in a capitalistic society whether we like or not, and jeepney like everything else is a transport business, “not a charity”. hindi kasalanan ng iba na humingi ng convenience, same way na hindi kasalanan ng mga tao kung bakit itong mga jeepney drivers na ito ay mawawalan ng trabaho kung sakaling matuloy man ang phase out. nilulugar dapat ang empathy at rules and regulation. hindi maaaring puro, pwede na lang. sa daan patunong progresong lipunan, masakit mang tanggapin, pero meron talagng collateral at masasagasaan. that’s how it is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/11komzv/a_hard_pill_to_swallow_pero_need_talaga/,7 03 2023
Tagalized Story.,"may story ako. ako lang ang nag-iisang babae sa pinag-tatrabahuhan kong kumpanya at alam ko na kung bakit. isa akong fresh graduate sa kolehiyo at gusto ko na talagang makapag-simula ng career agad-agad na walang kinalaman sa pagse-serve ng pagkain, pagpupunas ng mga gamit, o pag-dadala o timpla ng kape sa isang matandang negosyante. sa naka-sanayan nag-aapply ako sa trabaho na may anim na araw na trabaho at marami-rami na rin akong interview na napagdaanan. alam ko na ang tinapos kong hrm na kurso ay hindi gaanong makaka-kuha ng magandang oportunidad, pero naniniwala pa rin ako na may mas maganda pang trabaho na naghihintay sa akin. kaya naman nanatili akong positibo, matyaga, at nag-aapply lang sa mga office jobs na may magandang benipisyo. kahit halos wala na akong mapag-kunan ng makakain dahil sa magastos na mga interview, at least mapapag-tibay naman nito ang kakaunting pride na natitira sa akin. halos tatlong linggo na rin ang nakalipas, may isa akong phone interview sa isang internet security company. ang kumpanyang iyon ay maraming offices sa amin at naghahanap sila ng bagong customer support specialist para sa kanilang international department. ang mga requirements ay maganda o mahinahon na boses, good spoken and written grammar, kakaunting tech-knowledge, at may kakayahang mag-trabaho sa umaga at gabi. ang office ay dalawang sakay lang sa mula sa amin, at mayroon silang magandang offer sa health insurance. nag-aapply ako kahit lmitado lang din ang alam ko sa computer science. naging maayos naman ang phone interview at matapos ang dalawang meetings sa hr at sa management, binigyan nila ako ng isang napaka-gandang offer (kahit na wala pa talaga akong experience sa kahit anong trabaho). sa loob ng unang linggo ko, kailangan kong magtrabaho nang regular shift na 9-5 (am) para maging online ako kasabay ng manager ko, na nag-trabaho sa ibang branch ng kumpanya. pagkatapos noon ay kailangan kong magtrabaho para sa regular na schedule ko bilang support - ang schedule ko ay 6 na araw na pasok (09:00 am -05:00 pm (am) at may isang araw na night shift 09:00 pm - 05:00 am respectively). sa unang araw ko, ang suot ko ay isang loose na sweater at mahabang skirt. bilang sa kaalaman ko ay sa ganitong uri ng trabaho ay karamihan mga lalaki ang empleyado, ayaw ko naman mag-cause ng unnecessary attention dahil sa provocatively o inappropriately pag-susuot ng hindi naayon na attire. ang lalaki sa front desk ay mukha namang maayos na tao. pinakilala n'ya ang sarili n'ya bilang si andrew bago n'ya ako tulungang mag-fill out ng mga paperwork at sinamahan n'ya na ako sa aking mesa at sa isang open space na workspace. nakatitig lang ako sa tila walang katapusang mga desks habang naglalakad kami, napansin ko na halos hindi mo makikita ang mga mukha ng bawat taong nagta-trabaho na naka-upo sa bawat desks. wala man lang akong nakita o napansin na babae habang nag-lalakad kami sa tila baga'y walang katapusang workspace na iyon, na talaga namang hindi normal at nakaka-bahala. kahit ang kalmadong presensya ni andrew ay hindi kayang maiwaglit ang wari kakaibang pakiramdam na naka-tuon sa akin. halos maubusan ako ng hininga ng maramdaman ko ang mga presensya ng bagong kong co-workers na tila nagsasabi na ""hindi ka nababagay dito"". nagulat ako ng biglang huminto si andrew sa isang desk na napuno ng mga printed memes, floral stickers, at isang lumang keychain na naka-patong sa harap ng monitor. bukod pa doon ay natatakpan na rin ng makapal na alikabok ang keyboard, monitor at ang natitirang ispasyo ng desk. ""ahhh... anong nangyari..."" sabi ni andrew sa medyo upset na boses. ""pasensya ka na."" sabi nito habang nakatingin sa aking mga papeles. ""ah... aya. dapat matagal na 'tong nalinis. kailangan kong maka-usap ang custodian"". ""ok lang 'yun"", sagot ko. ""puwede ko namang punasan na lang 'yan, wala namang problema"". medyo asiwa na noon si andrew, pero habang ginagala ko ang aking paningin ay malinaw na wala ng ibang bakanteng desk maliban doon. mabilis na natapos ang araw na iyon. natutunan ko na ang mga dapat kung gawin na sumagot sa support related phone calls at gumawa ng bagong ticket para sa system. kailangan ko ring i-monitor ang lahat ng pumapasok na chats at written tickets at isaayos ito base sa level ng urgency at type nito. hindi naman ako required mag-bigay ng technical advice, pero dapat maging pamilyar ako sa aming product software. bilang wala pa namang mga tawag ay pinaki-alaman ko muna ang manual. halos wala akong maintindihan sa mga naroon kaya naman ginogle ko na lang ang karamihan na nasa manual. kinumusta ako noon ng manager ko at mukhang hindi s'ya masaya sa mga lapses ko sa mga materials. dahil pakiramdam ko wala akong matinong nagawa at gagawin sa mga oras na iyon ay panandalian akong nag-break para linisin ang mesa ko. tumayo ako para tanungin si andrew kung saan makaka-kuha ng basahan para sa mesa ko. agad-agad kong pinagsisihan ang desisyon kong iyon. ang bawat mata sa kwarto ay tila napako sa pagtayo ko sa aking kinauupuan. hindi ako sigurado pero maraming mga bulungan akong narinig habang papalayo ako sa aking mesa. ang kaninang maingay na mga keyboard ay pahina nang pahina na halos kainin na ako ng lupa sa sobrang hindi ko pagiging kumportable at self-conscious na rin at the same time. napansin ko na lang na halos halikan ko na ang dibdib ko sa pagyuko para lang hindi ako mapansin. bago ako maka-rating sa isang palikong daan patungo sa front desk ay buong-lakas kong tinignan ang isang tila walang hiyang lalaki na nakatitig sa akin. hindi ko alam kung ano ang inaasahan ko, pero 'yung overall appearance ng lalaking naka-hooding pang-asar na 'yun ay nagbigay ng matinding kilabot sa buong katawan ko. siguro mga ka-edad ko s'ya pero hindi man lang s'ya nahiya o natinag sa pagkaka-titig n'ya sa akin sa kabila ng pagtitig ko sa kanya na may halong pagka-bwisit at inis. isang kakila-kilabot na ngiti ang sumilaw sa mga labi nito habang naka-titig sa parteng bukong-bukong ng aking mga paa at dahan-dahan itong bumalik sa kanyang monitor. inisip ko kung anong magiging reaksyon n'ya kapag tinitigan ko rin ng kaparehong paraan ng pagtitig n'ya sa akin ang tinitigyawat n'yang leeg. parehong reaksyon pa rin ang nakuha ko habang naglalakad ako pabalik sa aking mesa kasama ang box ng computer wipes sa mga kamay ko. may maganda ring nangyari sa araw na iyon. habang nililinis ko ang mga drawer ng mesa ko ay may nakita akong half-used notebook mula sa nakaraang nagta-trabaho sa mesa ko. hindi n'ya nilagay ang first name n'ya, kundi initial lang at last name: j. espiritu. pero, base sa dekorasyon ng notebook, sigurado ako na babae rin s'ya kagaya ko. ang mga naiwan n'yang gamit ay nagbigay ng kapanatagan sa akin, pero 'yung notebook ang talagang pumukaw ng atensyon ko. doon ay sinabi nito ang pina-ikli at simpleng manual gamit ang easy-to-undertand terms at mga explenasyon sa nakaka-litong terminolohiya at komplikadong panuto sa manual. sa tulong n'ya ay nasurpresa ko ang aking manager sa aking product knowledge pagkatapos ng shift ko. matapos ang isang magandang araw ay buong tapang akong gumala sa office at nag-explore sa pantry. binenta ni andrew sa akin ang top-notch coffee machine at snacks sa nasabing pantry, tutal nagugutom na rin naman ako matapos ang isang emotionally, intellectually and productive na araw na 'yun. (ansabe). tsaka, medyo butas na rin 'yung bulsa at namumula na ang mga credit cards ko, kaya naman ayos na ako sa ilang pirasong masasarap na cookies. habang papalapit ako ay may narinig akong malakas na usapan at tawanan sa pantry. sa katangahan ko ay inisip ko na baka naman mas mainit, friendly o kahit maka-tao na sila sa akin. subalit ang maliit na pantry ay napuno ng katahimikan the moment na pumasok ako sa pantry. may limang lalaki doon na mag-kakaiba ang edad at lalaki na naka-upo sa palibot ng isang maliit na lamesa, at lahat sila ay naka-titig na direkta sa akin. ""panget na araw?"" - tugon ng isang pang-asar na boses. agad kong itinaas ang ulo ko mula sa pagkaka-titig sa sahig para hanapin ang pinag-mulan ng boses. hindi naging mahirap sa aking hanapin at malaman na mula iyon sa naka-hoodie na walang-hiyang tumitig sa akin nung nakaraan lang. ""siguro marami ka ng experience?"" - sambit pa nito sa nakaka-asar na tono at may-unting pag-taas ng kilay. ""para makakuha ng komportableng trabaho. siguro sikat ka?"". ""ano 'to, high-school?"" - sagot ko sa malakas na boses. hindi ko hilig kumompronta ng tao, pero sobra na 'to. hostility is one thing, social awkwardness is another, pero pakiramdam ko isa 'tong 80's na high-school drama na mga trenta anyos ang mga bida bilang mga teenagers. ""nandito lang ako para kumuha kape at kung may problema ka sa trabaho ko, puwede mong dalhin sa hr kung ano man ang issue mo"". nagpatuloy ako habang ine-enjoy ang namumutla at pahiyang mukha ng mga taong 'yun. mabuti naman, gusto kong maramdaman nila ang katiting na discomfort na buong araw kung kinakaharap. pinili kong lumayo sa aking mga co-workers, naglakad ako ng taas noo pabalik sa mesa ko na may hawak-hawak na tasa ng kape. bago pa ako maka-upo at enjoyin ang masarap na kape, napansin kong may isang mensahe galing sa hindi kilalang number: ""you have quite an attitude, don't you?"" nanigas ako habang hawak ang cell phone sa isa kong kamay at kape sa kabila. habang prino-proseso ko ang tila breach sa personal security ko, naka-tanggap ulit ako ng dalawa pang mensahe. isa ay ang hubo't-hubad kong katawan na sinend ko sa una kong serious college boyfriend. ang pangalawa: ""bakit hindi mo ngayon ibigay 'yang picture sa hr?"" sa totoo lang, sobrang naapektuhan ako sa invasion ng privacy ko. pumasok ang kahihiyan sa akin at sobrang naiinis ako for drawing so much unwanted attention sa sarili ko. kasalanan ko lahat 'to. pumasok ako sa isang office na puno ng ethical hackers na may pare-parehong pangalan ng aso bilang password. walang duda na ang litratong iyon ay umiikot na sa buong office at lahat ng iyon ay salamat sa walang hiyang ka-trabaho ko, at isa na akong kakatuwang tao sa loob ng office. hindi ko na ginalaw ang kape ko at umuwi na lang, habang pinipigilan ko ang bawat emosyon na bumuhos hanggang makarating ako sa safety ng bahay. halos hindi ako matigil sa kaiiyak nung gabing 'yun, iniisip ko na ang mga mukha ng mga ka-trabaho ko habang tigang na tigang na nakatitig sa hubad kong katawan. mga alas tres na ng madaling araw, doon ko lang na-realize na wala ng kwenta para pa magpaka-lunod ako sa kahihiyan. kailangan kong gumawa ng plano para maka-survive sa ganitong uri ng workplace. quitting is not an option kasi masyadong malaki ang pasweldo nila para tumigil ako. tsaka, halos tinapay na lang ang kaya kong bilhin sa araw-araw. ang pangalawa kong option ay pumunta sa hr, but there's no way i was going to open that can of worms. hindi ko mapapatunayan kong sino talaga ang nag-send ng mga mensahe na iyon. last option? stick with it, keep my head down, gawin ang trabaho na pinasukan ko at 'wag pansinin ang iba pang mga harassment na gagawin nila. 'yun nga ang ginawa ko. sa kabuuan ng isang linggong training ko ay pumapasok ako on time, hindi ako umaalis sa desk ko liban na lang kung pupunta sa palikuran. iniwasan ko rin ang kahit anong contact kanino man at pinanatili ko lang ang aking mga mata sa mga inanimate objects. salamat kay j. espiritu, palagi akong on top ng training ko. sa bawat bagong task na galing sa manager ko, laging may katumbas na entry sa kanyang notebook. wala ng nakaka-gagong texts at face-to-face na kumprontasyon, pero mayroong kakatuwang pakiramdam na panibagong sisira sa kalagayan ko. sa darating na biyernes na ang huling training ko, na nagdala sa akin sa huling entry sa notebook. night shift survival guide: - matulog sa buong umaga bago ang shift at 'wag na 'wag kang matutulog. - walang sino man ang dapat maka-pasok. - panatilihing may pepper spray na dala. (sa kahit anong sitwasyon). - i-check ang bawat aisle, meeting rooms. huwag kalimutang i-check ang ilalim ng lamesa, balkonahe, kitchen tables at kahit likod ng cooler. - laging mag-open ng skype na naka-ready sa emergency in case na hindi gumana ang mobile services. - panatilihing updated sa kaibigan/pamilya/lover kada oras. ang nasabing listahan ay medyo may kahulugan. una, sabi ng hr puwede naman akong matulog sa pagitan ng 2-5 am, basta malapit palagi sa akin ang office smartphone. mayroon nga silang pull out couch sa isang conference room para lang talaga sa ganitong sitwasyon. pangalawa, ang buong shift ay phone calls, kaya palaging may paraan para maka-tawag mula sa office phone, tama? lastly, ang mga naka-outlined sa ""guide"" ay parang o.a at paranoid. siguro 'yung listahan ay satirical? (ewan ko). siguro si espiritu parehas kami ng pakiramdam tungkol sa mga tila patay gutom na mga asong cold-blooded na co-workers? pero 'yung isip ko nag-tatrabaho ng sobra-sobra para makita ang logic sa likod ng mga pag-iingat na ito. may kakatuwa akong pakiramdam na may importanteng impormasyon akong hindi nalalaman. lahat 'yun iniisip ko habang paalis ako ng bahay nung biyernes na 'yun, last day ng training ko. ""andrew"", - dahan-dahan akong lumapit sa kanya. ""puwede ba mag-tanong?"" ""sure thing"", - sagot n'ya na may maaliwalas na ngiti sa kanyang mga labi. ""nagtataka lang ako, bakit wala akong nakikitang ibang support agents. i mean, 'di ba dapat merong at least lima pang tao para ma-cover 'yung six-day rotation cycle?"" ""kailangan mong tanungin ang manager mo tungkol d'yan. most likely naka-kalat sila sa iba pang branch sa syudad. normal lang naman 'yun sa ganoong kaso"", - sagot n'ya. pakiramdam ko tapos na kami sa diskusyon na 'yun matapos s'yang bumalik sa final tasks n'ya para sa linggong iyon. ""meron bang ibang agent na nag-trabaho dito liban sa akin?"" - pagpapatuloy ko, dahil ganun na lamang ang kagustuhan kong malaman ang iba pang detalye sa babaeng nag-fill out ng notebook na s'ya namang ginagamit ko sa buong linggong iyon. ""oo, may isang babae na humawak sa posisyon mo ng panandalian"", - ani ni andrew, habang naka-titig pa rin sa screen ng kanyang screen. pero napansin kong tumigil na s'ya sa pag-tatype o pag-galaw ng mouse. wari ko ay naka-titig lang s'ya sa iisang spot sa monitor n'ya. ""andrew"", - nag-salubong ang mga kilay ko. ""sino 'yung nag-trabaho malapit sa main working space na talagang nakaka-inis? maputla, medyo payat, maitim at kulot na buhok?"" - tanong ko, habang nagpapaikot ng daliri sa bandang ulunan ko para i-describe ang pagkaka-kulot ng nasabing lalake. ""ah... si michael"", - sagot nito, napansin nito ang pagiging iritable ng boses ko. ""may problema ba? ginugulo ka ba n'ya?"" ""hindi"" - sagot ko, pero sa isip-isip ko ay nagtatalo na ang emosyon at sarili ko. ""have a good weekend, andrew"" ""ikaw din"", - sagot nito, halata na may pagtataka sa boses nito habang papaalis ako. sa buong weekend na 'yun ay binabalik-balikan ko ang mga nangyari sa akin sa unang linggo ko. pakiramdam ko may hindi sinasabi si andrew sa akin na importante. wala namang rason para maging iretable s'ya nung nabanggit ko 'yung babaeng nag-trabaho bago ako. may nag-reklamo na kaya kay michael dati? pu-puwede kayang si j. espiritu? si michael ba ang dahilan ng survival guide sa notebook? bakit s'ya umalis? napaka-daming teorya ang bumagabag sa buong weekend ko. bago ko pa nalaman, oras na para bumalik sa trabaho. ito ang araw na talagang sobrang daming trabaho. kahapon ay lunes, ang unang regular day shift. mabilis lang dumaan ang nasabing araw, habang aligaga ako sa pag-sagot ng tawag, recording, sorting at assigning ng dose-dosenang customer complaints sa system namin. hindi sapat ang salitang nasanay na ako at pagkatapos ng araw na 'yun ay sobrang pagod at ubos na ako. saktong maglo-logout na ako, naka-tanggap na naman ako ng mensahe mula sa hindi kilalang number. ""ang sipag mo naman. hindi na ako makapag-hintay na mag night shift ka"" seryoso?! ito ang kauna-unahang mensahe na bumalot sa buong pagkatao ko ng takot. agad-agad kong ginala ang paningin ko kung nasa paligid ba si michael para kumprontahin ko s'ya sa pagse-send ng mensahe, pero kanina pa pala s'ya umalis. matapos kong pakalmahin ang sarili ko, umuwi na ako at sinusubukan kong hanapin si j. espiritu online. ang pinaka best bet ko noon ay sa linkedin, at doon nga ay sinusubukan kong galugarin ang buong listahan ng mga babae na may kinalaman sa proficient technologies na naka-lagay sa profile nila (halos kakaunti lang talaga sila). nung wala akong makita ay pumunta ako kay andrew at doon nga sa friend list n'ya ay sa wakas nakita ko na ang hinahanap ko. may babae na pangalan ay jennah espiritu at unemployed ang status. nag-send ako ng friend request na may mensahe na nag-papakilala at tinanong ko s'ya kung hinarass ba s'ya ng isa n'yang ka-trabaho. sa wakas, pakiramdam ko may patutunguhan na ako, natulog ako at inihanda ang sarili para sa bukas na event. naisip ko na baka may kakaibang mangyayari dahil sa pagbabago ng schedule nung natulog ako ng miyerkules. nag-check ako ng linkedin halos pagka-gising ko mga ala una. walang kahit anong sign kay jennah, kaya naman natulog ulit ako para makapag-handa sa night shift. medyo kinakabahan ako at excited at the same time kasi puwede ko ng mas malibot ang buong place of work ko intimately. dahil walang day crowd, malaya akong makaka-gala at ma-eenjoy ang cookies, dumura sa baso ni michael, kahit ano! may mga iilan pa ring mga nag-tatrabaho nung dumating ako para sa shift ko, pero hindi ko naman iyon pinansin at dahil sa nag-uumapaw na mga tawag at chats na aasikasuhin. makalipas ang dalawang oras, ang bugso ng mga tawag at chats pati mga tickets ay unti-unting bumagal hanggang tuluyan na nga itong tumigil ng sabay-sabay halos alas onse na ng gabi noon. sumandal ako sa kinauupuan ko at ginala-gala ang mga paningin sa aking workspace. wala ng tao noon sa office at least sa nakikita ko. naka-bukas ang lahat ng ilaw pero nung tinanggal ko ang headphones ko, may narinig akong mahinang jingling melody sa hindi kalayuan. para s'yang christmas carol, pero hirap akong tukuyin kong saan ito nangga-galing. wala namang dahilan para matakot ako sa pangyayari, pero pakiramdam ko ang mga nagtayuang balahibo sa mga kamay ko ay nagsilbing alarm. nang tumayo ako sa aking kinauupuan, nawala 'yung melody. well, naging paranoid na ako dati. minsan ko ng inisip na na may lalaking sumusunod sa akin isang gabi hanggang nilagpasan n'ya ako at nagtungo sa kalapit na tindahan sa 'di kalayuan. kahit mag-isa lang ako, lagi kong dino-double at triple check ang mga lock ng bahay bago matulog. aaminin ko na ang mga takot ko ay wala naman talagang basehan. mayroong naka-iwan ng headphones na konektado pa rin sa computer nito at naka-on ang music. o siguro may office party sa ibang kumpanya sa baba ng building. ang makarinig ng kanta ay nakaka-takot lamang sa mga kakatuwang horror movies, 'di ba? 'di ba?! para maka-siguro, hinalughog ko ang office para maka-siguro na mag-isa na nga lang ako. habang naglalakad sa gitna ng mga magkaka-dikit na desks, naisip ko kung gaano ako ka-swerte na mayroon akong sariling corner spot. hindi ko siguro kakayanin na mapalapit sa kahit sinong mga hindi kaaya-aya kong mga co-workers. matapos ko ma-check ang bawat rows ay dumiretcho ako sa front desk area at nagmamasid sa mga kagamitan ni andrew sa paghahanap ng clues. nung wala akong makitang clues ay bumalik ako sa main room ng pantry. unti-unti ng mas nagiging relaxed ang mga senses ko at tsaka ko lang napag-tanto na napasarap ata ang taste-testing ko sa mga cookies sa halip na mag-hanap ng mga kahina-hinalang mga bagay. kailangan ko ng tumigil sa kaka-kain ng cookies, pero dahil bumalik na naman ang kaninang tunog na naririnig ko, mas malakas s'ya ngayon. at the same time, ang work smartphone ko (na kinakailangan dala-dala namin kung aalis kami sa aming work station) tumunog at may mensahe mula sa hindi na namang kilalang number. so, nag-eenjoy ka ba sa cookies, ha? nanigas ang buong katawan ko habang prino-proseso ng utak ko ang mga pangyayari. siguro hindi talaga umalis ng office si michael at ngayon tinatakot ako. kinalikot ko ang tenga ko noon at nakinig ng maigi. walang kahit sino sa pantry as least sa nakikita at naririnig ko. tsaka, kung si michael ay nasa main workspace, hindi naman ganun kahirap na hulaan o sabihin na kumakain ako ng cookies. habang dahan-dahan akong humihinga, hindi ko muna pinansin ang tunog at nakinig ako ng maigi kung may iba pa akong tunog na maririnig. wala. dahan-dahan, naglakad ako sa may pantry drawers at doon may nakita akong malaking kutsilyo. alam ko bang gumamit ng kutsilyo? hindi. kaya ko kayang paalisin kung sino man ang unarmed na kalaban? syempre. papunta na sana ako pabalik sa aking work station ng biglang may tawag na pumasok mula sa work phone. ipinosisyon ko ang sarili ko ng kumportable sa pader ng pantry, kutsilyo sa kanang kamay, cell phone sa kabila, bago pa ako maka-sagot with the standard customer support greeting. nag static na sa kabilang linya at iba pang ingay sunod ang tuluyang pagka-putol ng linya at katahimikan. nung tinignan ko ang cell phone, nakita kong naka-patay na ito. sinubukan kong buksan ulit ito, pero hindi na ito gumagana. ok, ngayon kailangan ko ng bumalik sa computer ko in case na may pumasok pang mga tawag. naalala ko bigla ang isa sa mga guide na galing kay jennah habang isinusuksok ko ang walang kwentang cell phone sa bulsa ko. - laging mag-open ng skype na naka-ready sa emergency in case na hindi gumana ang mobile services. nangyari rin kaya 'to sa kanya? ang mga instructions sa notebook ay unti-unti ng nagkaroon ng kahulugan, at minumura ko ang sarili ko dahil sa pagiging tanga. sa oras na lumabas ang mga salita sa bibig ko ay may isa na namang mensahe ang dumating sa cell phone. kinuha ko iyon at sinubukang i-unlock, pero 'yung regular home screen ay hindi lumalabas. ang lumabas lang ay isang white screen na may maikling text. putang ina. ang mga babae dapat hindi ginagamit ng ganung mga uri ng salita. matapos kong mabasa 'yun ay nawala na ito sa screen at may panibagong text ang lumabas. bakit hindi ka lumabas at makipag-laro? huwag mo ng isiping bitbitin pa 'yang kutsilyong hawak mo. wala ring magagawa 'yan sa hawak kong baril. tinapon ko ang cell phone ko sa lapag at agad-agad ay nagtungo ako sa aking computer. ang tunog ay mas lalong lumakas habang papalapit ako sa aking lamesa, doon ay nakita kong may isang baboy na stuffed toy. may fabric button ito sa bandang paanan at music note na kasama. dito nagmumula ang tunog at nagpapatunay lamang na hindi ako mag-isa at may kung sino akong kasama. ang malala pa, pinapanood nila ang bawat galaw ko at sinusubukang takutin gamit ang mga laruang pambata. unti-unti ng dumadaloy ang pagpapanic sa aking buong katawan at naghahanda na sa fight or flight scenario. huminga ako ng malalim, sinusubukan kong pakalmahin ang buong katawan ko. so far wala pa naman akong naririnig ng kahit anong palatandaan na may ibang tao sa loob ng office. may mga background noises galing sa syudad sa labas at ang mga ingay mula sa naka-limutang patayin na computer ng isang employee. kung sino man ang gumagawa nito sa akin, kailangan kong malaman ang kanilang eksaktong lokasyon para maplano ko ng maayos ang pag-takas ko. isa pa, kailangan kong maka-kuha ng tulong sa lalong mas madaling panahon. habang iginigilid ko ang laruan ay umupo na ako sa aking upuan at pinull-up ang skype for business application. mabilis akong nag-dial ng 911, habang naka-loudspeaker ang telepono. tumunog na nga ang dial tone at agad-agad ay may live operator na sa kabilang linya. ibibigay ko na sana ang mga hindi kanais-nais na pangyayari sa akin ng mga oras na iyon ng may biglang humawak sa bukong-bukong ko mula sa ilalim ng lamesa. halos maubos ang buong lakas ko sa pagsigaw habang nagpu-pumiglas ang mga paa at mabilis na tumakbo sa abot ng aking makakaya sa bilis na hindi ko akaling kaya ko. may narinig akong kung anong kumusyon sa aking likuran habang tumakbo, kasunod ng isang malakas ng putok, na inisip ko na lamang na galing sa kung ano o sino man ang humahabol sa akin. bago ko pa malaman ay halos nasa ground floor na ako papunta sa pinto lagpas sa gwardiya na halatang nagulat sa mga nangyayari. ang malamig na hangin ay mabilis na pumasok sa manipis kong sweater habang papalapit ako sa isang malapit na pedestrian para humingi ng tulong. tumawag sila ng 911 at ang mga pulis ay agad namang dumating wala pang sampung minuto. habang naghihintay ako kasama ang gwardiya para sa kanilang pag-dating, hindi maalis sa isip ko ang sinulat ni jennah na warning, at kung gaano ako ka-tanga para ipagsa walang bahala ang mga ito. - i-check ang ang bawat aisle, meeting room. huwag kalimutang i-check ang ilalim ng lamesa, balkonahe, kitchen tables at kahit likod ng cooler. agad-agad namang sinulat ng pulis ang mga nangyari sa akin at iniwan ako kasama ang isang pulis officer, umakyat s'ya para i-check ang office. wala namang naka-labas-masok sa building mula nung tumakbo ako palabas, kaya malaki ang posibilidad na naroroon pa rin ang salarin at nagtatago sa loob. sa pag-iisip ay halos bumaliktad ang buong sikmura ko at mas lalo akong lumapit sa may armas kong kasama. maya-maya pa matapos kaming iwanan ng mga pulis, ang kasama kong pulis ay nag-radyo at isa-isa may mga boses na nagpapa-palit-palit sa radyo na humingi ng backup at nga mga codes na hindi ko maintindihan. mabilis na nag-escalate ang mga sumunod na pangyayari. imbis na pauwi ay dinala nila ako sa police station at doon ay nanatili ako sa isang interrogation room ng halos 2 oras bago pa sa wakas may dalawang pulis officer ang kumausap sa akin. pagod na ako noon, miserable ang kalagayan at higit sa lahat litong-lito sa kung papaano naganap ang mga pangyayari. gusto ko ng umuwi pero nanatili pa ako ng ilang oras para i-kuwento ang mga pangyayari sa dalawang pulis officer. 'ahh... meron kang kutsilyong hawak habang tumakbo ka galing sa pantry papunta sa lamesa mo? sigurado ka ba?' tanong ng isang nakaka-tandang officer na nagpakilala bilang senior investigator manlapig. 'ah. ah... oo.' pautal-utal kong sagot sa kanya. 'naniniwala akong meron. nag-papanic na ako noon, kaya mahirap sabihin. tapos may baboy na stuffed toy, ' sabi ko, habang tila baga'y nawawalan ako ng abilidad na mag-isip ng tama. 'at naniniwala ka na ang taong humaharass sa'yo ay si michael villareal?' sabi ng isa pang officer, hindi ko maalala 'yung pangalan n'ya. wala s'yang badge. 'hindi ko alam buong pangalan n'ya, pero wala na akong ibang kilala na iba pang responsable.' 'at sa huling pagkakataon, just for the record, anong nangyari matapos mong mag-dial ng 911?' tanong ni manlapig sa ika-apat na pagkakataon sa gabing 'yun. 'may kung sino ang humawak sa binti ko. bukong-bukong, actually. nangyari 'yun bago pa ako magkaroon ng pagkakataong ipaliwanag ang sitwasyon sa operator. nagsusumigaw at piglas ang mga paa ko tapos tumakbo hanggang may makita akong tao sa labas na pina-tawag ako sa 911 para sa tulong.' sagot ko, habang pagod na pagod sa paulit-ulit at paikot-ikot na pagtatanong. 'si michael villareal ay natagpuang patay sa hindi kalayuan ng iyong lamesa nung pumunta ang officer namin sa pinang-yarihan ng insidente. nakita mo ba ang kanyang katawan nung tumakbo ka palabas ng office?' tanong ng isang officer. halos malaglag ang panga ko sa mga narinig ko at tumitig sa dalawang pulis habang balisa at nanginginig sa takot. 'hi.. hi.. hindi,' pabulong akong nag-salita, 'hindi ko maintindihan,' 'sinaksak s'ya hanggang sa mamatay gamit ang malaking kutsilyo. ang katawan n'ya ay balot ng dalawampu't-tatlong saksak,' paliwanag ni manlapig. 'at nakita namin ang kutsilyo ay nakabaon sa bibig nito, dahilan para dumikit ito sa sahig diretcho sa lalamunan,' 'may rason kami para pagsuspetyahan na ito rin ang sinasabi mong kutsilyo,' dagdag pa ng pangalawang officer. nakatitig ako sa dalawang pulis officer ng tahimik, hirap akong intindihin ang mga pangyayari lalo na't ang utak ko ay halos mawala na sa ulirat. 'ang mga sinabi mo ay nagpapatunay lamang sa mga natagpuaan namin sa cell phone ni michael villareal. nalaman namin na may roon siyang hacking apps,' pagpapatuloy ng senior officer. 'natagpuan din naman ang ilan mo pang mga hubong larawan at ang mga mensahe na iyong nabanggit. mayroon s'yang baril at nakita rin naman ang basyo ng bala nung binaril ka n'ya habang papatakas ka.' 'ang hindi namin maintindihan ay kung papaano s'ya namatay.' dagdag pa ng pangalawang officer, halatang hindi s'ya naniniwala sa aking reaksyon. 'ok lang kung napatay mo s'ya dahil sa self-defense, aya. may balak s'yang masama sa'yo.' 'hindi,' pautal-utal kong sagot. 'pangako, wala akong ideya... oh, oh my god.' naiyak na ako dahil sa mga nangyayari. 'ibig kong sabihin, nung nakaraang buwan lang may nag-report sa kanya galing sa isa n'yang co-worker,' sabi ni manlapig. 'jennah,' bulong ko. 'kilala mo si miss espiritu?' tanong ng pangalawang officer, at ng suspetya sa kanyang mga mats. 'hindi,' ako ang pumalit sa lamesa n'ya at nakuha ko ang notebook n'ya. dapat sinabi ko na 'to kanina pa. anong sabi sa report? doon nga ay nagtitigan ang dalawang pulis at maka-lipas ang ilang sandali ay inilatag at ipinaliwanag ni manlapig ang mga hindi magandang nangyari kay jennah na halos mangyari na sa akin. si jennah espiritu ay dumiretcho sa pinaka-malapit na hospital mula sa kanyang unang night shift tatlong buwan na ang nakakaraan. sobrang bugbog ng katawan n'ya at sugatan, at gustong mag-file ng anonymous rape kit. ang natanong damage n'ya sa kanyang puwerta ay sobrang severe na kinailangan n'yang sumailalim sa operasyon at magpatahi. nag-file s'ya ng police report makalipas ang dalawang buwan matapos s'yang hindi pumasa sa probationary period sa inyong kumpanya, ng nawala s'ya sa trabaho (ang nagiisang paraan para mabayaran ang kanyang utang sa hospital). ang nangyari ay ang kanyang aligasyon kontra kay michael villareal, na gumastos s'ya ng malaki sama mo pa ang hindi mabilang na kanyang mga co-workers na kumontra sa kanya laban sa magalang at kaaya-ayang katangian ni michael. 'pero kahapon lang ay iniurong na n'ya lahat ng mga isinampa n'yang kaso kay michael,' sabi ng walang badge na pulis. 'kasalukuyan naming inaalam ang kinaroroonan ni espiritu para ma-interview namin s'ya. sigurado ako na ngayon malinaw na kung bakit may suspetya kami sa iyo bilang nakikilala mo espiritu.' nagpatuloy ang mga tanong ng dalawang pulis hanggang may isang lalaki na nag-abot sa kanya ng isang sobre. natukoy na ng forensics ang fingerprint na nakita sa kutsilyo at ang blood-spatter patterns. kinailangan ko ring mag-submit ng dna samples para maka-tulong sa imbestigasyon at sa wakas ay pina-uwi na nila ako. sa bahay, dahil sa sobrang pagod, hindi ako maka-tulog. wala akong gamit na naiuwi. bag, cell phone at kahit ang jacket ko ay kinailangan i-submit bilang ebidensya. kaya naman napilitan akong gamitin ang luma kong laptop, umaasa na malibang sa internet. ang browser ko ay naka-login pa rin sa linkedin account ko mula sa nakaraang login, at nirefreshed ko ang page bilang naka-sanayan. isang maliit na red icon ang lumitaw na mayroon akong bagong mensahe. jennah. nagre-reply na s'ya sa akin. don't worry, sis. i took care of it. ❤️",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/t77k69/tagalized_story/,5 03 2022
From Pulpolitiko Facebook page,"“wala kasi akong alam sa batas” nakulong ang tatay ko at ang kapitbahay namin sa laspinas. nagsimula po ito sa baranggay almanza dos, kaninang 8:30am pumunta ang tatay ko na si michael sa baranggay almanza dos, nagtatanong sya ng update tungkol sa relief goods dahil hanggang ngayon po ay wala pa kaming natatanggap. mga ilang minuto lang, dumating ang kapitbahay namin na si kuya tonyo, para po magtanong din, pero hndi po sila magkasama, magkapitbhay lang sila. nag video po si kuya tonyo ng mga relief goods na nakatambak lamang sa baranggay. nagalit ang mga tao doon, at sinabing bawal daw un. nagtaka nalang ang tatay ko na si michael, dahil nagkagulo na ang mga tao sa likod nya, nakita nya doon si kuya tonyo na kinokompronta ng mga tao sa baranggay dahil video. sabi nalang ni kuya tonyo, ipadelete kay kapitan ang video. dahil wala naman syang masamang pakay doon, gusto lang nya ipakita sa mga tao dito sa amin na may relief goods na doon. napansin ng baranggay na may suot si kuya tonyo na tulfo action shirt na bigay lamang ng kanyang amo. hinanapan sya ng id na kasama sya sa tulfo action, at out of nowhere sinabi nyang nasa bahay. inaamin namin na mali si kuya tonyo doon. mali sya sa sinabi nya, na hndi namin alam kung dahil sa takot o para lamang manindak, hindi namin alam. pagkatapos noon. doon na sila nagalit. at si sinabihang pusasan si kuya tonyo. ang tatay ko na si michael , hindi nila pinusasan. pagkatapos nito lumapit na ang tatay ko na si papa michael kay kapitan. at nagpaalam na uuwi na dahil kailangan nya ipaalam sa pamilya ni kuya tonyo ang nangyari. pumayag na si kap sa pag uwi ng tatay ko. biglang sumabat ung naglilista ng mga pangalan na magkaparehas sila ng address sa quarantine pass. at sinabi kay kap na magkasama ang dalawa khit hindi naman. magkapitbahay silang dalawa pero walang kinalaman ang tatay ko sa ginawa ni kuya tonyo. sinabi ng tatay ko na hindi sila magkasama at nagkataon lang na nagkita sila sa baranggay. hindi sila naniniwala kahit na pati si kuya tonyo ay nagsalitang hindi sila magkasama. pagkatapos nito, sabi ni kap, iposas na silang dalwa sa iisang posas kahit meron social distancing na naka ordinansa ngayon. nag salita ang tatay ko na hindi sya kasama bakit sya ipoposas. habang naka posas sila, napansin ng tatay ko na may nag vivideo sa knyang taga baranggay. vinevideohan sya habang nakaupo at naka posas. isa ito sa mga kinagalit ng tatay ko dahil ang sabi nila bawal magvideo, bakit nila ito ginagawa? pumasok ang lalaking taga baranggay at sinumbong kay kapitana na nagagalit si papa sa knya. mukhang preso ang tatay ko doon kahit wala namang kasalanan. wala syang ginagawa sa inyo. dinala na sila sa precinto sa otso, sa daang hari evia. balik nanaman sa baranggay. nagtatanong sila kung sinong arresting officer, walang masagot ang mga taga baranggay at nag tuturuan pa kung sino sa kanila ang arresting officer. otw sa cityhall, kinuha ang mga gamit nila na importante dahil baka nakawin ng mga preso sa cityhall. doon naramdaman na ng tatay ko na tuloy tuloy na ito sa kulungan kahit wala naman silang kasalanan. pinapunta na sila sa city hall at kinulong. maya maya ay lumapit ang taga baranggay kay kuya tonyo at sinabing tanggalin ang password ng cellphone nya. nandoon ang video ng relief goods. may batas po ba dito na nakalabag sa privacy ni kuya tonyo? pag pasok ng tatay ko sa kulungan, ang tanging word para idescribe ang mga tao doon sabi nya sakin “para syang nasa babuyan”. alam nya sa sarili nyang hindi sya dapat nandoon dahil wala syang kasalanan. grabe ang galit ko bilang anak. habang nakikinig sa kwento ng tatay ko. nabugbog ang tatay ko sa loob. sinipa sa sikmura at ngayong 8pm kitang kita ko ang pasa sa knyang tyan. isa sa mga preso ay pinapaligo sya, hindi sya pumayag maligo, at sinipa sya bigla sa tyan. walang palag ang tatay ko. wlang kasalanan nilang pinasok sa kulungan. maya maya after almost 1 hr tinawag na si papa, pinapalabas na. ang sabi nila “pasalamat ka malakas ka sa kababayan mo.” hindi maipaliwanag ni papa kung matutuwa sya. o magagalit. dahil wala naman syang dapat ipagpasalamat dahil wala syang kasalanan. nag signal si kap na pakawalan na daw si kuya tonyo dahil madaming nakiusap na taga dito samin around 8pm. alam nyo ba?

Update on Nala my Maltichon,"for anyone else wondering here's my previous post about her: [help me raise 8k php for my dog nala](https://www.reddit.com/r/philippines/comments/gn1qjm/please_help_me_raise_php_8k_for_my_dog_nala_for/) *we succesfully gathered around php 3k with all your help and i'm really glad and amazed what you people can do for a stranger's dog. maraming salamat po! sincerely from me.* so i'm posting this update para sa mga redditors na nag follow kay nala especially sa mga nag donate. **may 22:** around 2 days after i posted a cry for help sa r/philippines nala isn't getting any better, kumakain pa din may gana pero hindi na ganun kalakas kagaya dati. but thursday night hindi siya kumain which is hindi naman nakakabahala, unfortunately morning to tanghali ayaw niya pa rin kumain so i tried carrying her and kinakausap ko siya but she's not responding. nabahala ako so tinry ko siya itayo para maglakad lakad pero bumabagsak lang siya ulit, nagpanic na ako so i called his original vet if he could help. i know it's a reach kasi ecq pa pero makakapunta daw siya hintayin ko daw siya sa bahay. when he arrived he told me to rush nala sa clinic nila (his original vet clinic) so nalaman ko nagbukas na pala sila around 2nd week of may. sinugod namin si nala sa furry friends sa caloocan and luckily siya lang ang patient non. they told me na grabe na yung damage sa skin niya and saw na baka may maggots yung paws na niya. they also told me that amputation is possible kapag unrepairable na or nabubulok na sugat niya especially sa paws at sa tail. masyado dinb daw manipis balat ni nala and napakadaming flakes na nagfafall off from her body kaya siya nangangati. &#x200b; [at furry friends clinic](https://preview.redd.it/saqrwsbx70251.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9443944503ec0cdd2041bd25de98691f5de3085b) i decided to skin scrape and cbc her. never pa siya na cbc, so ayun ang goal ko kasi hindi ko alam bakit hindi pa siya gumagaling since march. sa skin scrape nakita na meron siyang demodex (hindi ko po alam spelling) pero its an insect that causes itchyness and galis. she's positive for mange. the problem is usually marami na daw yung 1 to 2 na insect sa isang skin scrape pero sa kanya 12 (take note na hindi pa yun sa sugat kumuha) which indicates na sobrang abnormal na ng dami nung parasites. &#x200b; [shivers and cleaning ng sugat niya](https://preview.redd.it/eewwtclz70251.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=47d84285281125ed50cf12986e72905fba1b77b2) they told me this is caused by stress. dapat daw na cocontrol ng immune system niya yung pagdami nun kaso dahil na stress siya most probably because of the grooming kasi dun nagsimula siya mangati, sobrang dumami yung demodex. they even showed me what's on the microscope. nakakalungkot isipin na dahil lang sa simpleng grooming nagkaganyan na yung dating healthy na siya. cbc came out and they saw an abnormality sa mga components. may bacterial infection siya kaya bumababa ata ang hemoglobin niya hindi ko gaanong sure. while we were discussing, nala started to shiver and the doctor said na kinokombulsyon siya kasi 40 degrees yung temperature niya. &#x200b; [sorry nabura na yung cbc na naka attach, i also lost the computation how much it costs but naka php 3200 ako, she has around 6 na iniintake and a spray, plus the three injections.](https://preview.redd.it/z82q4n1380251.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9adfcdb1977fff2d30706a925e9023975745cb67) &#x200b; https://preview.redd.it/50ji08fa80251.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bea67e1d3f2a8d1a55a0fcf680fe2d1c326b73b0 they cleaned her sugat. and injected her three times. yung dalawa anti mange/anti parasite and yung isa for her fever. they told me na this will be a 6 week long na gamutan and babalik kami dun every friday starting 22. i agreed. they also told me to stop seeking for convenia because it'll be too costly and hindi sure na gagana, at least eto daw proven, they told me to make nala sa comfortable as possible to reduce her stress. bumalik na kami last friday and the doctors said na shes getting better albeit she lost .4 kg. pinalitan na din namin diet niya to reflex pero hindi niya gaanong kinakain. she's still weak, barely walking but nakakalakad na at least. the first 3 days din from 22 kamot siya ng kamot as in walang tigil kaya nakaka stress pero since monday she stopped itching na. nagtatanggalan na langib niya din. &#x200b; [her favorite spot on my chair](https://preview.redd.it/evaj95l190251.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=575df5eb0c79a5f0e8595cdfc248329bbbb63014) &#x200b; &#x200b; [latest pic, hindi na reddish skin niya and nagtatanggalan na scabs niya.](https://preview.redd.it/lpfmo7t390251.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4cbf0b6cdff492d9a6045c04268ec1345d1f9533) i**'m here to post this update to thank you guys for the support.** masakit man, pero kelangan ko kayo because some of my family members think na sayang lang ang pera sa kanya at ipamigay na lang daw namin tapos bumili na lang kami ng aso. i had arguments with my family because of this. maraming salamat po, she's recovering slowly pero hindi namin siya titigilan hanggang sa hindi siya gumagaling! **donations are still welcome, sobrang maappreciate namin yung donation because i barely have anything left.** 6 weeks na gamutan pa siya and every week may injection sa kanya. i hope na you guys are still willing to donate to an anonymous stranger and his dog. *if you are willing to donate please drop me a dm. pwede na din po bank kasi nakausap ko na gf ko and she lent me her bank account for donations.* ***please dm me for account # or gcash.*** &#x200b; thank you so much!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/gtqe7f/update_on_nala_my_maltichon/,31 05 2020
[NEED MEDICAL/LEGAL ADVICE] Doctor refused to sign my medical documents,"hi everyone! i don't know where else to ask this. or if this is a valid case to get a lawyer? can someone please enlighten me... 🙏 january 5 kasi, nagpasugod ako sa er ng isang private hospital dahil nag diarrhea ako with blood, and laging masakit tyan and joints ko then na admit ako from january 6-12. i have 3 different doctors. wala po akong pinili sakanila, sila lang ang nirefer ng health card ko sakin. and sa pagkatagal tagal kong nagstay dun, napagdecide nila na for ct scan ako. it happened january 11. yung 2 doctors, after lumabas ng results ng ct scan kinausap ako. (surgeon and rheumatologist) they agreed na bumuti na yung condition ko during my week-long stay. and base sa results ng ct scan, okay naman. no need for surgery, continue the medication nalang. pumayag na sila madischarge ako and mag followup nalang. so nagpa discharge na ko. however, nung kukuha na ko ng mga medical documents and fit to work, yung 1 doctor (gastro specialist) which is my main physician pa, gusto pa ng isang test dahil parang may nakikita daw syang bato sa gallbladder. i should do mrcp/ercp test pa daw. in her own firm words, ""never"" nya kong bibigyan ng fit to work and sign my medical documents. dahil need ko daw po muna gawin yung test na nirerequire nya, and for possible surgery daw po yung case ko. which is nag refuse na ko dahil... (1) inubos na nila laman ng health card ko (2) wala na rin akong cash pang test (3) i'm feeling better now (4) i think i have the ""right"" to decline because its my body? (5) no one even bothered to tell me how ct scan is done. i asked multiple nurses and parang ultrasound lang daw, ""uncomfy"" lang daw. claustrophobic po ako, at sobrang nginig at takot ko nung nandun na ko feeling ko mahihimatay na ko sa kaba. then i asked how is mrcp/ercp done, same as ct scan lang daw. 🙃 (6) i'm ready to die-- in fact, i'd rather die than do the test again. i asked her what are my other options. do the test lang daw. she wouldn't give me a fit to work dahil hindi nya daw po iririsk yung medical license nya giving ftw to someone na hindi naman talaga fit to work 🥴 kahit pumirma pa daw ako ng waiver. im not sure but i think mrsp cost around 20k+, kasi yung ct scan sakin is 25k already. i told her wala po talaga akong pera pang test, her answer is ""its not my problem anymore"". i asked help from my 2 other doctors at baka sila na pwede mag sign, no. si doc gastro daw kasi main physician ko so sakanya daw talaga dapat. help, i respect naman po her decisions pero tama po ba na kahit ayaw na ng patient, kahil alam na ng patient yung risk and ayaw talagang ituloy, need po ba talaga sumunod sa gusto ni doc magpatest and possible surgery? hindi po ako makabalik sa work ko kasi need yung documents. tinry na kausapin ng company doctor namin si gastro specialist, and same lang din sinasabi. i dont know much about medical and legal field. so i'd appreciate any help. asking for legal advice kasi baka this is something na pwede ilaban lol. kung hindi, edi wag. wag na tayo pastress. =========== tldr; kelangan ko ng signed medical documents para makabalik sa work, pero ayaw i-sign ng main doctor ko kasi hindi ko nasunod yung gusto nya na magpa-test pa. 💸 =========== thanks in advance. p.s. sabi ni doc bawal ako mastress at mapagod, pero bakit naman ganito sya mismo nagpapastress at papagod sakin magpabalik balik ng hospital 😵 & andami pa po nila kabalastugan for the whole duration of my stay (ex. they asked me to fast 48hrs for ct scan, yes 48) pero sobrang haba na para ichika ko pa lahat dito. gusto ko lang naman po bumalik na sa work...",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/kzvmoj/need_medicallegal_advice_doctor_refused_to_sign/,18 01 2021

Worst experience in hospital,"dinala namin sa pinaka malapit na private hospital yung lolo ko kasi bigla sya nahirapan huminga pero level 1 lang pala sila kaya kinailangan na ilipat sa ibang hospital yung lolo ko. then nung nakausap na namin yung paglilipatan sa kanya, yung girl na kausap namin sa phone from that hospital ay walang bukang bibig kundi yung mga payment na need namin bayadan if don kame pupunta. sabi nya na kailangan daw namin agad mag down ng 100k or if wala pa 50k daw muna at pwede naman daw namin ibigay agad kinabukasan. sabi din nya na yung room daw nila ay nag rrange ng 20-30k per day. she even ask kung ano daw ba ang source of income namin. emergency yung case ng lolo ko kasi papunta na daw yun sa heart attack and nung andun na kami sa hospital na unang pinagdalhan sa kanya kahit may oxygen na sya, bumababa pa din o2sat nya. sobrang nahihirapan na huminga lolo ko non at need na need na den sya ilipat pero patuloy pa den nyang dinidiscuss yung lintik na payment na yan. tapos pagdating namin don sa hospital nila, wala pa pala yung doctor kundi papunta palang. perang pera sila tapos wala pa pala yung doctor don. ending nilipat nanaman namin sa ibang hospital lolo ko pero huli na yung lahat. you see? kung gaano ka bullshit mga hospital dito sa pilipinas nag aagaw buhay ka na gigipitin ka pa. may pera pa kami neto ah paano pa kung wala. kawawa talaga pag mahirap ka dito. nakakalungkot lang na hindi na patient care ang goal sa mga hospital kundi pure business na lang.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/18ars19/worst_experience_in_hospital/,4 12 2023
What does Albularyo do (witch doctor/folk healer)? Do they really do something? May naniniwala pa ba sa kanila in this generation?,"so i have a brother, he's 25 year old. we rushed him twice in the hospital this week. pero prior pa sa mga episodes na'to, he's feeling symptoms already eg. tightness of chest, nagka-cramps ang katawan niya, difficulty sleeping, nahihirapan huminga, etc. after all the medical exams, okay naman lahat ng results niya, normal lahat ng test. a friend of his advised him to go to albularyo (which i am against kasi i think he's having mental health problems talaga which affects he's overall being since yung mga symptoms niya ay linked to anxiety and depression eg. panic attacks/difficulty breathing). but i just let them para sa peace of mind na rin na atleast we all did everything possible kahit na talagang kapos kami, we just don't want him to feel na pinapabayaan namin siya. so fastforward kung saan pumunta yung albularyo sa bahay, wala naman siyang masyadong ginawa. may sinabi na may lumalaro raw sa kapatid ko (nangkukulam daw sa kanya), mas marami pa actually yung pagboboast niya na he's done something for someone, na siya yung reason kung bakit nalaman kung sino yung kumuha sa wallet ng isa niyang pasyente (?). he's just engaging us in the conversation. he also said na yung mga ibibigay niyang papakuluan at iinumin ay exported pa raw and such. and to my surprise p4000 lahat yung siningil niya for that session only. he's not the typical albularyo rin, naka-car siya and mukha namang well-off. do you think reasonable yun as bayad? i mean, may mga naririnig naman na akong albularyo before pero usually hindi ganun kalaki ang hinihingi nila. since parang act of altruism yon in their part since meron silang god-given gift. i don't have anything against sa mga albularyo or naniniwala/nagpeperform nga mga ganoong rituals pero i felt robbed for me and sa kuya ko kasi we chipped in sa bayad. malaking bagay na yon para samin, he's living paycheck to paycheck and i'm still reviewing for my boards so big deal talaga yun sakin. and if ever may magtanong kung bakit hindi ko na lang sinuggest na magvisit ng psychologist. it is still not acknowledge sa amin, especially sa pamilya namin. and simply not accessible. (how can i put it into words) parang still stuck sa phase na ""nasa isip mo lang yan."" bottomline, are albularyos a thing? am i just overreacting sa bayad? edit: i'm reading all your comments guys and i really appreciate them. pero hindi ko lahat ma-process right now kasi my manung just talked to the albularyo, and he's asking him 5k kasi may ritual daw silang gagawin bukas and he's gonna bathe him with god knows what and how, at hindi pa sure kung yun na yung last na hihingin niya. and he assured him daw na 'pag 'di gumaling, ibabalik daw yung binayad. i really can't process anything right now kasi i'm thinking na baka this is only the beginning nung mga paghingi hingi niya, and knowing my brother he really won't listen to any of us. edit: please don't share this with any platform update: i took your advice guys and told him na he should instead see a therapist since malaking bagay yung hinihinging 5k. i also forwarded informative videos na very similar sa mga symptoms na nafifeel niya na linked to anxiety. unfortunately, umutang daw siya ng pambayad and binayaran na niya. and he won't acknowledge yung idea na maybe he has anxiety. sobrang close minded niya with regards doon. i'll just hope and pray for the placebo effect.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/17nhpid/what_does_albularyo_do_witch_doctorfolk_healer_do/,4 11 2023
Gusto ko lumayas ng bahay pero hahanap muna ako ng place where my aso will be taken care of hehe,"by take care: a house with a space where my dog (siberian husky) could run! he's never been caged nor left alone :^) i'll pay you for taking care of my precious dog. i'll shoulder the expenses of my dog's needs. just give him lots of hugs, scratches (and walking time i guess) and love! let me visit him as well. and if the time comes i get a house, please give him back to me. medyo demanding and ideal (for me) sorry but i'll pay (i hope 3k a month is enough for your care). so yeah, just want to know if anyone here knows a place (around diliman, qc or antipolo) who can shelter my dog for the meantime. maybe i'm just lost and desperate pero gusto ko na umalis sa bahay. here's the thing. ako ang panganay sa magkakapatid. my parents no longer work because of the pandemic. i, meanwhile, graduated the exact year this pandemic started. anyway, i earn measly. a far cry from what people assume my income would be as a graduate of the top university and with awards to boot. because of this, since the beginning of the year, paulit-ulit at buwan-buwan na lamang akong natatawag na walang kwenta at walang patutunguhan sa buhay. ako na nauubos ang sahod sa monthly expenses ng bahay at literal na walang pera pangsave for grad school ay walang kwenta. sa totoo lang, wala naman akong pake talaga na napupunta sa pamilya ko yung sahod ko, pero ibang usapan na kasi kung inggrato yung napaglalaanan? lam niyo yun. sukang-suka na ako dito. tuwing naririnig ko boses ng mga tao dito, nahihirapan ako huminga, tumutulo bigla ang mga luha ko. every month, may breakdown ako. gusto ko na lumayas. pero hindi pwede dahil may mahal akong aso dito. mahirap makahanap o minsan ay mahal pa ang mga lugar na pwede dog. slightly hindi option din yun kasi hindi sanay yung dog ko maiwan. baka magkasepanx haha. pwede din siguro if yung landowner ay dog lover, maybe they can look after my dog hmmm tldr: i badly need you guys to suggest a place/person/institution who can take care of my dog na parehas sa idea ko ng care please please",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/q5wz4t/gusto_ko_lumayas_ng_bahay_pero_hahanap_muna_ako/,11 10 2021

"alex, tanghaling tapat ng sabado, 2021","(any review for this is very-very much appreciated. i'm an aspiring writer po and i just launched a passion project anthology, isa po ito sa mga kwento) &#x200b; **chairman** ngayon ko lang naranasan ‘to sa tagal ko nang nanunungkulan sa barangay. isama mo na sa mga karanasang ‘yon ang lahat ng away mag-asawa, suntukan ng mga lasing, at mga batang ginagahasa sa bukiran. pero eto… ngayon ko lang napansin na buong araw ko na palang hinihimas ang rosaryong nakasabit sa leeg ko. maya’t-maya ko pa hinahalikan at binubulungan na sana’y wag mangyari sa pamilya ko ang nakita ko kanina. naririnig ko pa rin ang sigaw ni cecil, kumare’t-kapitbahay namin, tanghaling tapat ng sabado, kung saan ang tanghalian sa buong kalsada nami’y naantala dahil sa kanyang nakakakilabot na sigaw. sa ilalim ng nagbabagang init ay nagsitakbuhan kami upang sumaklolo. kinailangan ko pang iwanan ang tinola ni misis at ang isang basong softdrinks na nilalanguyan pa dalawang yelo nang ako’y tumakbo papunta sa bahay ni cecil. ngayo’y hindi pa rin ako kumakain. sa totoo nga’y hindi pa ako nakakaranas ng gutom. hindi ko pa ata kaya. sa bahay ni cecil ay dinatnan namin ang katawan ng panganay ni cecil na si joe na nakaratay sa braso ng kanyang bunsong kapatid na si alex, sa sahig ng kanilang sala. sa leeg ni joe ay nakabaon ang basag na bote na ginamit ni alex na balot na balot sa dugo ng kanyang kapatid. agad ang kapit at halik ko sa aking rosaryo nang makita ko ang imahe; na parang sinaunang obra na naglalahad ng malagim na kwento. pero ano ang kwento neto? hanggang ngayon ay wala pa rin kaming ideya kung bakit. magmula sa pagsigaw ni cecil ng, “anong nangyari?! anak, anong nangyari?!” sa tulalang alex na nakatitig sa dilat na mga mata ni joe, hanggang sa pagpunta namin dito sa aking opisina sa barangay, ay wala pa rin kaming makuhang rason mula sa bakit. sa isang maliit na kwarto sa aking opisina’y pinaupo ko muna si alex. tulala at sinusubukang burahin ang dugo sa kanyang mukha gamit ang duguan ring damit n’ya. hinainan ko ng isang bote ng softdrinks at tatlong pandesal mula pa sa agahan namin kanina si alex, na agad namang n’yang kinain ng walang pag-aalinlangan. dito na nagsimulang gumapang ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod. isang kilabot na hindi ko maipaliwanag, habang pinapanood ko si alex na walang awat sa pagkain, habang ako’y hindi ko pa rin magawang matakam sa masarap na lutong nag-aabang sa’kin sa bahay. “alex,” marahan kong sinabi. “ba’t mo ginawa ‘yun?” tumingin lamang sa’kin si alex, patay na mga mata, bibig na mabagal ang nguya. at sa kanyang paglunok ay walang mga salitang bumalik sa’kin. hindi ko alam kung bakit pero bigla kong naalala si jefferson, isang tricycle driver dito sa’min. dalawang taon na ang nakakalipas nang mapatay n’ya ang isang dayo na nakaaway n’ya sa kalsada. nangyari ‘to nang kamuntikan n’yang makasalpukan ang sasakyan ng dayo, at nang nahinto silang dalawa’y nagkasagutan muna sila bago mapikon si jefferson. hinampas n’ya ng bakal na tubo ang dayo. hindi na raw n’ya napigilan dahil sa mga mapanglait na mga salitang tinawag sa kanya. bobo, unggoy, uling, mababa. labing-isang beses paulit-ulit na hinampas ni jefferson sa ulo ang dayo, at sa sobrang lakas ng bawat hampas ay may parte na ng utak na lumabas dito. sa prisinto’y naalala ko si jefferson, iyak nang iyak at humihingi ng tawad dahil sa nangyari. hindi makakain, hindi rin makatulog. nilamon na s’ya ng konsensya n’ya, at ang konsensya n’ya ang tumulak sa kanya na agawin ang baril ng isa sa mga pulis na nagbabantay, at iputok sa kanyang sariling ulo. nasaktan si jefferson, nagalit, at di nakapagpigil. naintindihan ko ang kwento ‘nun. pero bakit hindi ko maintindihan ‘to? alam kong magkasundo ang magkapatid na ‘to. alam ko kung ga’no sila kalapit sa isa’t-isa. kaya pa’no nangyari ‘to? ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod ay gumagapang paakyat hanggang sa aking dibdib, tila ba kumakapit ng mahigpit. pasikip nang pasikip at medyo nahihirapan akong huminga. ang kakaibang pakiramdam na ‘to’y tumitindi habang nanatiling tahimik at nakatitig lamang sa’kin si alex. biglang iniabot ni alex ang kanyang kamay at dito tumalon na ang puso ko. napaatras ako sa aking kinauupuan, at mabilisan kong hinugot ang aking rosaryo mula sa pagkakatago nito sa aking damit. itinutok ko ito kay alex, na walang ibang kibo kun’di ang kunin ang bote ng softdrinks na nasa harapan n’ya. mas bumilis pa ang pagkatok sa aking dibdib, na para bang kamuntikan na kong mamatay. habang si alex nama’y pinapanood lang ako habang patuloy ang kanyang pag-inom. wala nga ata talagang mangyayari, at nang maramdaman ko kung gaano katahimik ang kwarto’y kumalma na ako. bakit sa dulo ng utak ko’y hinihiling ko na may sapi o di kaya’y isang demonyo talaga ang kaharap ko, at sa presensya ng aking rosaryo’y masasaktan s’ya. kahit anong kakaiba. kahit ano basta magkaroon lang ng eksplenasyon ang nangyari. pero siguro’y kakaiba na rin ang ikinikilos ng bata. at siguro nga’y mas dapat talaga akong matakot sa buhay kaysa sa patay. **cecil** “saan ba ko nagkulang?” tanong ni aling cecil sa mga kumare n’yang nakapalibot sa kanya sa masikip na opisina ni chairmain. napapaligiran din s’ya ng makukulay na mga pamaypay na hindi sabay-sabay ang pagaspas sa harap n’ya; nilulunod si aling cecil sa hangin. ang kanyang mukha nama’y tila ba isang rebulto ng santo kung punas-punasan ng mga panyo. “hindi ko pa rin maintindihan,” dugtong n’ya. “hindi naman ako nagkulang sa aruga. pareho ko namang pinapakita sa kanila na pantay ang pagmamahal ko sa kanila.” tuyo na ang mga mata ni aling cecil, ngunit tila ba hindi pa rin tapos ang kanyang pag-iyak. “hindi sila nag-aaway. hindi ko man lang narinig na nagtalo silang dalawa. o kung may pagtatalo man, malamang sa malamang maliit na bagay lang ‘yun. hindi yung ikakamatay mo!” isang labi ng lumapit sa tenga ni aling cecil, “alam mo tingin ko, baka inggit ‘yan. kasi si joe lang may trabaho sa kanilang dalawa, di ba? tapos si alex, wala pa rin sa kolehiyo. nag-aaral pa rin. sigurado akong ‘yun ang dahilan.” isa pang labi ang lumapit sa kabilang tenga naman ni aling cecil, “baka napikon na. kasi di ba halos s’ya na sa lahat ng gawaing bahay? baka pakiramdam n’ya porke’t mas malaki ambag ng kapatid n’ya , alila na s’ya neto.” isang labi naman na kaharap ni aling cecil ang nagsabing, “baka nagbabait-baitan lang kasi nga si joe ang halos sumasalo sa mga bayarin, pati sa pag-aaral n’ya. pero galit talaga s’ya, kasi baka naman may pagkakataong mas nabibigyang-atensyon si joe kahit hindi n’yo napapansin. kasi halimbawa uuwi s’yang pagod galing sa trabaho, syempre di n’yo maiwasang alagaan, pagsilbihan.” sa gitna ng mga labing ito’y si aling cecil, at ang ideyang unti-unting nabubuo dahil sa mga sinasabi ng mga labi sa kanya. “siguro,” sabi n’ya. “siguro nga.” **abbie** ang pangalan n’ya’y abbie. social worker daw s’ya. pagpasok n’ya’y agad bumungad sa’kin ang asul na bra sa ilalim ng dilaw na blouse nang tapatan ito ng liwanag mula sa bintanang katabi ko. sa kanyang pagtali ng buhok ay nakita kong basang-basa na ang kanyang kili-kili at kumikinang na sa pawis ang kanyang leeg. “alex?” sabi n’ya habang maya’t-mayang tinutulak ng kanyang daliri ang salamin n’yang dumudulas sa kanyang matangos na ilong. “bakit di mo ikwento muna sa’kin ang nangyari bago tayo umalis dito?” pasensya ka na, abbie. hindi ko nagawang sabihin kay chairman, na kilala pa mandin namin. hinding-hindi ko rin masasabi sa’yo. walang ibang maglalahad ng nangyari kun’di ang mga taong nais magbigay kahulugan dito, kasi kung ako tatanungin kung bakit, sa totoo lang, hindi ko rin alam ang isasagot. may nabasag akong bote sa kusina kanina, at sa pagpulot ko nito’y pumasok sa isip ko ang isang udyok. yung tipo ng udyok kapag nasa mataas kang lugar, at bigla mo na lang gustong itulak ang kasama mo. pero alam mong hindi ito dapat gawin, at kakapit ka pa nang mas mahigpit sa kanila para masiguro mong hindi ito mangyayari. ang udyok na ito’y nagsabi sa’kin na isaksak ko kay kuya ang basag na bote. at nalaman ko na lang na totoo na pala ang lahat nang dumapo sa aking balat ang mainit na dugo ni kuya. nahinto lang ako nang maramdaman ko ang buto sa leeg n’ya at nang marinig kong nabibilaukan na s’ya sa kanyang sariling dugo. hindi ko pa rin alam kung bakit. sana, tulad ng iniisip ni chairman, ay nasapian na nga lang ako. pero nakita ko ang lahat, andun ako. hindi ko lang alam na totoo pala ang lahat. namatay si kuya joe sa wala. at hindi ko matanggap na wala. normal lang sana ang sabado namin. tahimik. nanonood lang si kuya ng tv, naglilinis ako sa kusina. si nanay nama’y namamalengke ng pananghalian namin. bicol express daw ang lulutuin n’ya. puta, sinira ko ang araw. gusto kong umiyak dahil hindi na kami babalik sa salo-salo namin. “alex?” muling tawag ni abbie. “gusto kong malaman kung bakit. tayong dalawa lang. kaibigan mo ko dito. hinding-hindi ko ‘to sasabihin sa nanay mo, sa mga kapitbahay n’yo. may mga naririnig ako sa labas na dahil daw sa inggit? totoo ba ‘to? sa inggit nga? magmula nang dinala ako ni chairman dito sa maliit na kwartong ito’y napagpasyahan kong manahimik na lang sa nangyari. sa ngayo’y nilalabanan ko ang mga luha, nilalabanan ko ang panginginig ng aking bibig, at ang mga salitang gustong lumabas mula sa’kin. dapat mukhang hindi ko pinagsisisihan. dapat mukha akong galit. para naman mabigyang halaga, mabigyan ng ibig-sabihin ang pagkamatay ni kuya joe. dapat tinatatak ko sa utak ko na dapat lang! dapat lang sa kanya ang nangyari. dapat hindi ako bibigay. dahil kapag natalo ako, mamatay talaga sa wala si kuya. “sige, kung ayaw mong magkwento, ako muna. kasi naalala ko ‘tong isang batang babae at ang tatay n’yang abusado. tatay n’yang lasinggero. tatay n’yang isang beses s’yang hinipuan sa kanyang sariling kwarto at pinilit. ampon ang batang ‘yon, at tatay-tatayan n’ya lang etong umaabuso sa kanya. takot na takot ang bata dahil pakiramdam n’ya isang gabi’y papatayin na lang s’ya bigla neto. kaya naman isang gabi, nang bigla s’yang pinuntahan ng kanyang tatay upang pagsamantalahan ulit, sinasaksak ito ng bata gamit ang lapis sa mata, sa leeg, at sa dibdib.” kumuha ng panyo si abbie. sa kanyang paggalaw ay muling sumisilip ang kanyang bra sa likod ng blouse na parang mga batang naglalaro sa likod ng kurtina. “masarap sa pakiramdam, pero pumapatay pa rin s’ya ng tao. ilan taon n’yang dinibdib ‘yun. hanggang ngayon nararamdaman pa rin n’ya ang mga kamay ng tatay n’ya sa kanyang ari. sa kanyang dibdib. ilang taon bago n’ya matanggap ang ginawa n’ya. ngayon, medyo mahirap pa ring ikwento, pero kahit papaano’y kaya ko na. nangyari na kasi.” para bang may sumuntok sa aking dibdib nang marinig ko ‘to. bigla kong tinanggal ang aking paningin sa kanyang bra, at sa paggalaw ng aking mga mata’y bigla kong naramdaman ang pamumuo ng mga luha. “ayos lang, alex. pero andito lang ako. aalagaan ka muna namin. tapos pag handa ka na, makikinig ako. kahit pakonte-konte pa, ayos lang. aantayin kong mabuo ang kwento mo.” bumibilis bigla ang tibok ng puso ko. lalong nanginginig ang aking labi. at biglang pumasok si kuya sa isip ko, tumatakbo papalayo sa akin. mga bata pa kami, at hinahabol ko s’ya. “alex?” kuya wag kang lumayo! “alex?” kuya dito ka lang! kailangan kita dito! “sige, ayusin na natin pag-alis mo.” at parang isang batang nadapa sa semento, dito na walang awat na tumulo ang luha sa aking mga mata. “alex?” “hindi ko rin alam… hindi… ko rin alam. sorry, kuya! sorry! hindi ko rin alam kung bakit! patayin n’yo na lang ako! hindi ko alam anong nangyari! hindi ko na kaya!” lumalabo na ang aking paningin, pero kahit ga’no kalabo ang aking mga mata’y kitang-kita ko ang gulat at takot sa mukha ni abbie. pasensya ka na, kuya.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/nlygsa/alex_tanghaling_tapat_ng_sabado_2021/,27 05 2021
Nakakapikon yung mga taong kulang sa social manners,"it's 9 am today tapos yung kapitbahay namin nagpapatugtog ng napakalakas to the point na rinig na rinig sa buong bahay namin yung music sa speaker nila. nagising tuloy ate ko. there was also a time na i have to do a video recording for my java project. di ako makapag-record kasi nagpapatugtog sila that time and anywhere i go sa bahay walang tahimik na spot dahil yung nag-iisang silent spot dapat is yung kwarto ko, kaso rinig yung speakers nila dito. luckily, tumigil din sila after 15 minutes, dahil hinahabol ko yung deadline ng group namin that day. honestly, napipikon na ako sa taong walang manners or etiquette sa mga taong nasa paligid nila. and of course, di mo pwede sitahin kasi mamasamain ka pa ng mga gago mong kapitbahay. and to be honest, maraming tao ang ganyan kahit saang lupalop ka mapunta, **it's very infuriating.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/zb48jj/nakakapikon_yung_mga_taong_kulang_sa_social/,3 12 2022

Anong mga fear mo as a little kid?,"hey, it's the season of spooks and scares, can you share your fears as kids? for example, yung iiwanan ka ng nanay mo sa counter ng grocery kasi may babalikan sya sa loob. tapos palapit na ng palapit na ikaw na ang next tapos hindi mo alam ang gagawin mo kasi wala ka naman pambayad. sa loob loob mo sumisigaw ka na ng ""mamaaaaa!"" so not just supernatural stuff. kahit mundane stuff. for me, nung natuklasan ko na someday, the sun will go supernova so everyday stressed ako kung that would be the day na sasabog ang araw. another one, napansin ko na automatic yung paghinga ko, tapos napraning ako na what if pag natulog ako tapos hindi huminga yung katawan ko? so puyat at stressed nanaman. share yours.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/yiytzy/anong_mga_fear_mo_as_a_little_kid/,1 11 2022

I hope Leni's administration brings back competent people in the govt,"i work in the development sector. i've worked with international donor funded projects before like us ones and all i can say is... maraming magaling sa pilipinas. wala nga lang sa gobyerno. my previous managers and coworkers are freaking geniuses in their craft and work. ang gagaling. tipong going above and beyond and ang scary ng competence nila. they all used to work in the government too but left for the private sector kasi sobrang taken advantage sila sa govt. sobrang panget ng kalakalan sa govt. one thing i noticed about leni and her office is that they move like an international ngo. biro naming tropa is mabagal govt and employees kasi di naman nauubos pera nyan. walang deadlines. sa devt sector 5 years, 6 years, etc lang ang project mo so may hinahabol kang oras. need mo talaga ng accountability sa pera mo din. lahat dapat may means of verification (movs). lahat may reports and documentation. dapat tugma ang reports at movs. ang trip mo may 1, natapos ka ng may 3, dapat by may 6 at most submitted na report mo. sobrang galing and bilis ng process sa maraming internationally funded projects kasi doon napunta ang mga leaders natin. marami sa kanila galing sa govt na nagsawa sa pamamalakad at sistema i hope if, no, when leni wins mahikayat nya muli silang bumalik. marami tayong competent leaders and development workers guys. sadyang wala lang sila sa gobyerno",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ufdz3g/i_hope_lenis_administration_brings_back_competent/,30 04 2022
How Incompetent Polices are (S/O Cainta + Taytay),"warning: semi-long post. for context: incident was paghablot ng phone sa tapat ng bahay resulting to access to online bank and e-wallets unauthorized transactions. dumulog na kami sa tanggapan ng kapulisan, gabi nang nangyari ang insidente, sa kabisig cainta, ang sabi ng pulis 1 ay kung gusto raw namin, dumiretso kami sa cybercrime sa taytay. nanakawan kami pero hindi naalok na mag pablotter agad. thanks for entertaining us tho. kinabukasan, nagpunta kami sa cybercrime ng taytay, diversion road (as advised ni pulis 1). ang sabi doon ay dapat pinablotter ito sa unang police station na napuntahan dahil sa paghablot na naganap. ang inaaccomodate na kaso kadalasan sa cybercrime ay yung mga online transactions lang, meaning sa online din nagkakausap. machika ang mga pulis na to, gusto pa ako mag apply sa kanila. instead na mag focus sa story, inalam pa pati personals like university graduated, civil status. nag chika pa siya na, pupunta sila sa tagaytay later that day, masarap mag bulalo. fck. bumalik kami sa kabisig, cainta police station, ibang pulis ang nakaduty. sabi ni pulis 2, dahil sa mga kailangang signatory ng police report, sa munisipyo ng cainta raw kami mag complain at humingi siya ng pasensya. agad kaming nagtungo sa cainta police station katabi ng fire station sa munisipyo. habang kinakausap namin ang pulis 3, na tila walang interes sa sinasalaysay namin, tinatanong niya kung para saan ang police report. in short, sabi niya, hindi naman daw kailangan ang police report sa pagpa block or retrieve ng number sa globe or ntc. na parang ang dating ng sinabi niya samin ay, so kung hindi kailangan ng police report, hindi mo rin papakinggan yung complain namin? bakit hindi raw sa barangay nag pa blotter? nagsemi burst out na ko. una, hindi namin kilala yung suspects. paano kung armado pa sila? at anong mapapala sa pag pa blotter sa barangay? anong next action? napilitan siya mag pasagot ng incident report form, after non, sinalin niya sa log book (yung blue) in hand written. naka upo lang kami. sabi niya “okay na po. na blotter na” nagtaka ako wala man lang inabot na kung ano sa amin. ganun na siguro yung “blotter” na tinatawag. nagtanong ako kung “wala bang printed nito”. saka pa lamang nag paprint, ito na siguro yung police report. meron akong kausap sa call dahil sa kainipan ko kaya nasa labas ako. pagbalik ko sa loob nasa kasama ko na ang police report. umalis na kami. nag lunch muna. pinatingin ko sa iba yung police report via online. mali raw yung petsa. hindi na kasi namin check pag kakuha pag kalabas yung police report. naglagay sila ng info sa police report na ang petsa ay hindi pa nangyayari. 1pm palang noon, sa papel, 2pm daw ng araw na iyon nangyari. papaanong nakapagpa print kayo ng hindi niyo nirereview ang nakasulat or even ask us to review it? basta binigay lang? btw, may kasabay kaming nagrereport din, carnapping incident, pinahiram kami ng ballpen (thank you). nag-abot sila ng pera sa mga pulis pero verbally tumanggi sila, pero tinanggap ang pera. imagine, ang pakiramdam, na para kaming pinag pasa pasahan ng mga kapulisan. basta nag pa print ng police report na hindi tinitignan ng tama ang detalye. kahit may cctv, may dala kaming videos, ni-isa walang nag alok na tignan to. dahil din siguro sa pagnanakaw lang ito. napaka incompetent. kung hahalungkatin, maraming nagaganap sa area namin. i never thought how incompetent polices are, 'till i experience this with them, first hand. madada sila but their actions reflect their big tummies. i imagine paano nila hinahabol ang suspects with their dad bods. maybe, this is one of the reasons din why some people resorts na ilagay sa mga kamay nila ang batas. i understand them now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/17eb6ic/how_incompetent_polices_are_so_cainta_taytay/,23 10 2023

Our daily dose of hopium: silent Leni supporters,"may event sa family kung saan may ilang hindi nakadalo. dahil dun sa mga absent na yon, nagkaroon ako ng opportunity makausap nang totohanan yung pinsan kong lalake kung sino talaga iboboto niya. before this, dalawang beses na ako nag-attempt na ikampanya si leni sa mga family members na madalas ko makainuman. both times, either tahimik lang si pinsan or pabiro ang mga sagot (like si rastaman daw iboboto niya). kanina nung kausap ko siya, pabulong niya inamin na ""silent"" daw siya. silent ano? silent bbm? nope. silent leni. ang pinsan kong to, gym rat. malaki ang katawan, yung tipong magdadalawang isip ka bago mo banggain. friendly din siya at magaling makipag-koneksyon. madami siya kaibigan na mga pulis. sabi rin niya, yung mga kaibigan niyang pulis na yon, leni supporters din. aminin ko guys, nabuhayan talaga ako ng loob. sabi niya kasi ayaw lang talaga niya mapaaway dahil sa choice niya, siguro dahil na rin ayaw niya makwestyon yung pride niya bilang maton na lalaki na boboto sa babae. pero aware siya sa mga kakulangan ni babym para magpatakbo ng bansa. binanggit pa nga niya yung smni debate na nagpasaring si clarita carlos dun sa mga hindi umattend ng debate nila. (please help me cite this kasi di ako nanood non.) parang nakalimutan nila na si marcos jr. ang numero unong duwag pagdating sa pakikipag-debate. one last thing na sagot ni insan nung sinabi ko na kaya tayo dapat nanghihikayat pa kasi yung survey gap ang hinahabol, mauulit daw ulit yung nangyari six years ago during the vice presidential election. i do think baseless yung confidence niya na ganun nga ang mangyayari kahit wala tayong ibang gawin, but the thought is at least heartening. p.s. kasama namin sa usapan yung isa ko pang pinsan na undecided daw pero lbm ang asawa. hopefully napaisip man lang namin siya kung hindi outright nakumbinsi mag-leni then and there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/tycnjb/our_daily_dose_of_hopium_silent_leni_supporters/,7 04 2022

""kate, nasaan ka?"" kalmado kong tanong sa kanya. abot abot ang kabang nararamdaman ko. natatakot sa posibleng mangyari. lakad takbo ang aking ginagawa papunta sa kanila. ""ayoko na"" walang ganang sagot ni kate. ""pagod na ako, sab."" walang buhay niyang sagot. ""kate, please stay with me. wag mo ibababa ang tawag. malapit na ako ha?"" suyo ko sa kanya. rinig ko ang malalim niyang paghinga sa kabilang linya. ramdam ko ang kanyang lungkot, tumatagos ito sa aking pagkatao, nag-usal ako ng panalangin sa aking isipan at tumakbo na sa kanilang bahay. apat na bahay na lang lalagpasan ko at malapit na ako. ""sorry, sab."" may narinig akong pagbagsak ng isang bigay kasunod ng pagputol ng tawag. nanlalamig ang aking katawan, kahit sa nanlalabong mga paningin dahil sa mga luhang humaharang rito ay mabilis akong pumunta sa kanilang bahay. ""tita! tito!"" sigaw ko nang makaabot ako sa kanilang pinto, maya maya pa ay binuksan ng kuya ni kate ito. ""uy sab, miss me?"" tanong ni matt ng pabiro pero tinulak ko siya at bago man ako makaakyat ay natanaw ko pa ang ibang masasayang miyembro ng pamilya ni kate. lingid sa mga ngiti ng bawat isa meron na pala isa sa kanilang nagdurusa. ""sab! bat ka nagmamadali?"" sigaw ni matt sa ibaba ng hagdan at napamura ako rito saka sumigaw ""p\*tangina tumawag kayo ng ambulansya!!"" nakalock ang kwarto ni kate kaya kinalampag ko ito ng kinalampag, nagsiakyatan na rin ang magulang ni kate at sinimula nilang tawagin ito hanggang sa tuluyan ng sinira ni tito ang kanyang pintuan. ""kate! kate!"" sigaw ko rito at nagtungo sa kanyang banyo at naabutan namin si kate na nakahandusay sa sahig at napapalibutan na siya ng dugo. ""kate, andito na ako. shh"" haplos ko sa kanyang pisngi at humalik sa kanyang ulo. binuhat siya ni tito, umiiyak ang kanilang bunsong kapatid, ang kanyang ina nama'y natataranta at si matt ay nakatulala lamang sa aming nadatnan takot na takot man ako pero nagpakatatag ako para sa bestfriend ko. si kate, isa siyang masayahing babae, matataas na grado ang nakukuha sa eskwelahan, kinagigiliwan ng lahat, madaling maging kaibigan pero siya rin yung babaeng magaling magtago ng tunay na nararamdaman, nakangiti kahit nahihirapan. napahikbi ako ng isakay na nila si kate sa ambulansya at sumunod rito sina tita at tito, naiwan ako sa kanilang bahay kasama si matt at ang bunso nilang kapatid na limang taong gulang. binuhat ko si sarah at inalo ito. ""shh, magiging okay din ang ate kate mo. magiging okay din ang lahat."" hinaplos ko ang buhok nito at tumingin kay matt na tulala pa rin hanggang sa ngayon, nahawakan niya rin ang kanyang kapatid kung kaya't may mga dugo ang kanyang mga kamay. ""all this time, akala ko kilala ko yung kapatid ko. akala ko nagpakakuya ako sa kanya, akala ko wala siyang problema, akala ko open kami sa isa't isa"" tulala niyang sambit. ramdam ko ang sakit sa tono ni matt, maski ako akala ko nagawa ko na lahat ""this will be the lesson para sa ating lahat. no matter how happy they look, no matter how healthy they are. there's a possibility that loneliness can kill us."" napahinga ako ng malalim. ""kate wants to kill that feeling pero hindi yung mismong siya. kate is a fighter, matt. napagod lang siya pero sana sa panibagong pagkakataon na meron siya ay sana andito na tayo to help her and support her with her own battle."" mangiyak ngiyak kong sambit nang maramdaman ko na niyakap ako ni matt habang buhat buhat ko si sarah.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/10e5v8v/kaibigan/,17 01 2023
Are college dropouts just s**t out of luck in the Philippines?,"i was a member of the very last batch to graduate highschool before k12 was implemented. in fact, kami ung literal na hinahabol ng program. if we were to fail or stop, we would have to go through this system in order to get back on track, dahil mga units ng kolehiyo inadjust to accommodate the new curriculum. suffice to say, i fell from the rat race. **di kinaya ng utak at bangko eh hahaha**. this was the worst time to stop my education pero wala na rin. di na payag mga nagpapaaral sakin na magpatuloy pako dahil sa performance ko. so i resolved to continue my studies on my own. nagiipon ako from my salaries to build this one shot at college, where i have no one to disappoint but myself and my bank. so ngayon na pumasok na nga tayo sa \*golden age\*, may mga pagasa pa ba na makabalik ang mga dropouts na tulad ko? if there is, how will i and many others navigate through this messy educational system on our own? kasi sa totoo lang, napaka lopsided ng sistema natin na may mga huminto na hindi na ulit nakakabalik. i'd like to know how to navigate this dilemma properly. *p.s: i've already heard the phrase ""when there's a will, there's a way"" way too many times. kung pwede nga pagkakitaan yang phrase na yan dapat siningil ko na sila kada sabi eh haha.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/wpim9t/are_college_dropouts_just_st_out_of_luck_in_the/,16 08 2022
Theories regarding Manileños being wimps or hanggang salita lang vs. Probinsyanos who enact what they threaten to do.,"i've seen a recent post on r/ph about a group of friends drinking on a bridge (i think this was in cdo) tas nagkapikunan. naglabas ng kutsilyo yung isa, kinampihan sya ng iba pang kasamahan. tumakbo papunta sa kotse yung hinahabol ng patalim and he ran over his friends going after him. one died. tas dun sa discussion thread people say that probinsyanos do what they say during altercations, hindi yung puro pananakot at salita lang katulad ng mga taga manila. why do you think this is the case? here i present my theories: most probinsyanos are exposed to farm animals. they know how to slaughter a pig, a chicken, a goat. they don't get queasy around blood. they have a strong stomach so to speak. for that reason, they're less likely to run in fights even if it gets bloody. law enforcement is lax in the provinces. so police are less likely to be available when altercations between neighbors occur. also, properties are more far in between each other in the provinces than in manila. because of this, there are fewer witnesses, fewer people who will mediate and try to break up a fight. i remember my trip to bicol where we visited a farmland of a relative of a friend. the relative of my friend has this huge scar on his face, as if his face was hacked by an itak. he was very hospitable and even went up a coconut tree for us to eat some fresh buko. we asked our friend what happened to his relative, sabi nya nag tagaan daw sila ng kapit bahay nya. away sa border ng property line. na-imagine ko sa isip ko yung scenario ng away nila. walang tao sa paligid nila nung nag tagaan sila. walang umaawat. malawak na bukid lang yung setting. they were several kilometers away from any law enforcement outpost. i doubt they called the police to settle the dispute. parang kill or be killed na lang. so because of these circumstances, probinsyanos are generally built this way. now take the case of a manileño. will he run from law enforcement if he sees a checkpoint tas wala sya driver's license or unregistered yung vehicle nya? hell no. because police here may shoot to kill you if you try to run away. sa probinsya uso yung tatakbuhan mo yung mga pulis sa checkpoint. ang gagawin lang ng law enforcement ay babatuhin lang nya yung stack of tickets na hawak nya dun sa naka motor na walang helmet. you are also more likely to get charged for assault if you have an altercation here in manila. kaso kaso ang labanan sa manila, pati yung hassle na magkakaroon ka ng police record. that is why magaling lang sa pananakot, mag name drop ng mga powerful people na kakilala during an altercation. thoughts? edit: removed a redundant phrase.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/y1aymg/theories_regarding_manileños_being_wimps_or/,11 10 2022

Cornered by a religious group,"i am currently living with my brother who's a member of this particular religion famous in the philippines. we are not in the ph and i don't know anyone where we are right now. while my brother has friends here dahil sa religion nya. when we were still in ph, nainvite na ako once ng brother ko sa church nila pero humindi ako and he never asked me again. now that i just recently arrived here, cinorner ako ng mga superior nya dito sa tinitirahan namin. it was past 9pm at night nung dumating sila. i was working since i am working as a freelancer ngayon. busy naman talaga ako nun kasi may hinahabol akong work tapos tinawag ako at 'magpakita' lang saglit kasi it would be 'rude' if i didn't show myself while they were there. and ayun na, tnanong kung nakapunta na ako sa church nila and sabi ko hindi. my brother was expectantly looking at me since he knows na iimbitahan ako. alam na nagwowork ako ng weekdays so plinano na nila na sa sunday eh susunduin ako sa apartment para raw sabay kami punta church. i froze on the spot and couldn't say no. plinano na lahat and my brother was already agreeing for me. my blood is boiling just typing this. i'm disappointed na hindi ako humindi pero at the same time galit ako kasi bakit kelangan pumilit ng tao at cornerin sa bahay nila ng napakalate na oras?? they were doing this while in the ph too but i had a lot of things to use as reason nun. now, i just don't know what to do. baka every week iinvite na ako. i think i'll just go this one time and say no the next time. haay but until now ang sama ng loob ko talaga. edit: just want to add that my trip going to the country where we currently are was paid by my brother. siya gumastos ng flight and ung apartment is his. i do have money but not enough to pay him back yet. i'm slowly paying it but honestly i think it will take a long time. and i want to add din na i was diagnosed with anxiety disorder. people with anxiety usually have a hard time with confrontation. i'm still trying to learn this skill until now. kasama toh sa tinuturo sa therapy ko. i know this isn't an excuse pero i hope people who will comment will be kinder. i appreciate those who are kinder with their comments despite me not sharing this the first time i posted this. didn't think at first that my anxiety was something na important to mention pero i think kailangan to get the whole picture.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/yfy786/cornered_by_a_religious_group/,28 10 2022
Story time: Uninformed News Edition,"a friend showed me a tiktok video of a supposed influencer sharing his thoughts on covid. the video (with embedded texts) went like this: ""storytime: covid 19 edition and then dinala sa hospital, dead on arrival. then sabi nung doctor sa mga kamag anak. kung papayag yung family na ang ilagay sa death cert nung namatay ay covid instead of heart attack 😱😱. so yun lang, idk what to do with that information kaya skl."" let me answer you, what you should do with that information is ask someone who is knowledgeable on the topic or at least someone who knows more than you do, cause you definitely don't know a lot. what you should not do though is post a video putting the hospital and medical professionals in a malicious light. for those of you who wants to be educated on the topic: anyone who is symptomatic, we can't mix with those who do not have the symptoms. ubo, sipon, lagnat, hirap sa paghinga, pananakit ng kasukasuan, pagsusuka, pagtatae or pagkawala ng pang-amoy at panlasa. you might be wondering, eh ang daming sakit with the same symptoms. yes, kaya nga po puno ang emergency rooms and covid floors. unless proven na negative ka sa covid (with rt-pcr), it is prudent that we don't place you with those without the symptoms. hospital protocols also dictates that anyone who arrives dead will be tagged as covid suspect (relating to the tiktok vid, paano nasabing heart attack? may ckmb ka? may trop i ka? may ecg ka ba???). covid also complicates underlying conditions like heart, brain problems which might have led to the demise of the patient. did the patient die of a heart problem? possible. did the patient die of covid? possible. hindi sya exclusive, and unless we do post-mortem swab, we will not know. the government ideally should fund more research centers and laboratories, to make testing more available kahit sa maralita. sayang yung mga inutang. hindi lahat ng tao afford ang 2-5k na rt-pcr swab na may 7 days validity lang. pag may rt-pcr ka na timely ang collection, you need not be tagged as suspect and can be treated sa covid negative area, therefore decongesting the covid suspect area, therefore freeing some resources that can be used for those in critical conditions. i am all for freedom of expression, but i also believe in responsible posting. supposed ~influencers~ should help us eradicate misinformation, use their platform for greater good. you also address your audience well. isang taon na tayong lockdown, ang dami nang dinagdag na letra sa cq. baka naman po? if you have any questions, if in any way i can explain things in simpler terms. i also urge people in the medical field to answer people the simplest way possible, to be ""patola"" na. our job extends way outside the corners of the hospital. di na lang covid ang kalaban, bad governance, ignorance and misinformation too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/mgihgq/story_time_uninformed_news_edition/,30 03 2021

hanggang ngayon ay wala pa rin kaming ideya kung bakit. magmula sa pagsigaw ni cecil ng, “anong nangyari?! anak, anong nangyari?!” sa tulalang alex na nakatitig sa dilat na mga mata ni joe, hanggang sa pagpunta namin dito sa aking opisina sa barangay, ay wala pa rin kaming makuhang rason mula sa bakit. sa isang maliit na kwarto sa aking opisina’y pinaupo ko muna si alex. tulala at sinusubukang burahin ang dugo sa kanyang mukha gamit ang duguan ring damit n’ya. hinainan ko ng isang bote ng softdrinks at tatlong pandesal mula pa sa agahan namin kanina si alex, na agad namang n’yang kinain ng walang pag-aalinlangan. dito na nagsimulang gumapang ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod. isang kilabot na hindi ko maipaliwanag, habang pinapanood ko si alex na walang awat sa pagkain, habang ako’y hindi ko pa rin magawang matakam sa masarap na lutong nag-aabang sa’kin sa bahay. “alex,” marahan kong sinabi. “ba’t mo ginawa ‘yun?” tumingin lamang sa’kin si alex, patay na mga mata, bibig na mabagal ang nguya. at sa kanyang paglunok ay walang mga salitang bumalik sa’kin. hindi ko alam kung bakit pero bigla kong naalala si jefferson, isang tricycle driver dito sa’min. dalawang taon na ang nakakalipas nang mapatay n’ya ang isang dayo na nakaaway n’ya sa kalsada. nangyari ‘to nang kamuntikan n’yang makasalpukan ang sasakyan ng dayo, at nang nahinto silang dalawa’y nagkasagutan muna sila bago mapikon si jefferson. hinampas n’ya ng bakal na tubo ang dayo. hindi na raw n’ya napigilan dahil sa mga mapanglait na mga salitang tinawag sa kanya. bobo, unggoy, uling, mababa. labing-isang beses paulit-ulit na hinampas ni jefferson sa ulo ang dayo, at sa sobrang lakas ng bawat hampas ay may parte na ng utak na lumabas dito. sa prisinto’y naalala ko si jefferson, iyak nang iyak at humihingi ng tawad dahil sa nangyari. hindi makakain, hindi rin makatulog. nilamon na s’ya ng konsensya n’ya, at ang konsensya n’ya ang tumulak sa kanya na agawin ang baril ng isa sa mga pulis na nagbabantay, at iputok sa kanyang sariling ulo. nasaktan si jefferson, nagalit, at di nakapagpigil. naintindihan ko ang kwento ‘nun. pero bakit hindi ko maintindihan ‘to? alam kong magkasundo ang magkapatid na ‘to. alam ko kung ga’no sila kalapit sa isa’t-isa. kaya pa’no nangyari ‘to? ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod ay gumagapang paakyat hanggang sa aking dibdib, tila ba kumakapit ng mahigpit. pasikip nang pasikip at medyo nahihirapan akong huminga. ang kakaibang pakiramdam na ‘to’y tumitindi habang nanatiling tahimik at nakatitig lamang sa’kin si alex. biglang iniabot ni alex ang kanyang kamay at dito tumalon na ang puso ko. napaatras ako sa aking kinauupuan, at mabilisan kong hinugot ang aking rosaryo mula sa pagkakatago nito sa aking damit. itinutok ko ito kay alex, na walang ibang kibo kun’di ang kunin ang bote ng softdrinks na nasa harapan n’ya. mas bumilis pa ang pagkatok sa aking dibdib, na para bang kamuntikan na kong mamatay. habang si alex nama’y pinapanood lang ako habang patuloy ang kanyang pag-inom. wala nga ata talagang mangyayari, at nang maramdaman ko kung gaano katahimik ang kwarto’y kumalma na ako. bakit sa dulo ng utak ko’y hinihiling ko na may sapi o di kaya’y isang demonyo talaga ang kaharap ko, at sa presensya ng aking rosaryo’y masasaktan s’ya. kahit anong kakaiba. kahit ano basta magkaroon lang ng eksplenasyon ang nangyari. pero siguro’y kakaiba na rin ang ikinikilos ng bata. at siguro nga’y mas dapat talaga akong matakot sa buhay kaysa sa patay. **cecil** “saan ba ko nagkulang?” tanong ni aling cecil sa mga kumare n’yang nakapalibot sa kanya sa masikip na opisina ni chairmain. napapaligiran din s’ya ng makukulay na mga pamaypay na hindi sabay-sabay ang pagaspas sa harap n’ya; nilulunod si aling cecil sa hangin. ang kanyang mukha nama’y tila ba isang rebulto ng santo kung punas-punasan ng mga panyo. “hindi ko pa rin maintindihan,” dugtong n’ya. “hindi naman ako nagkulang sa aruga. pareho ko namang pinapakita sa kanila na pantay ang pagmamahal ko sa kanila.” tuyo na ang mga mata ni aling cecil, ngunit tila ba hindi pa rin tapos ang kanyang pag-iyak. “hindi sila nag-aaway. hindi ko man lang narinig na nagtalo silang dalawa. o kung may pagtatalo man, malamang sa malamang maliit na bagay lang ‘yun. hindi yung ikakamatay mo!” isang labi ng lumapit sa tenga ni aling cecil, “alam mo tingin ko, baka inggit ‘yan. kasi si joe lang may trabaho sa kanilang dalawa, di ba?

baka pakiramdam n’ya porke’t mas malaki ambag ng kapatid n’ya , alila na s’ya neto.” isang labi naman na kaharap ni aling cecil ang nagsabing, “baka nagbabait-baitan lang kasi nga si joe ang halos sumasalo sa mga bayarin, pati sa pag-aaral n’ya. pero galit talaga s’ya, kasi baka naman may pagkakataong mas nabibigyang-atensyon si joe kahit hindi n’yo napapansin. kasi halimbawa uuwi s’yang pagod galing sa trabaho, syempre di n’yo maiwasang alagaan, pagsilbihan.” sa gitna ng mga labing ito’y si aling cecil, at ang ideyang unti-unting nabubuo dahil sa mga sinasabi ng mga labi sa kanya. “siguro,” sabi n’ya. “siguro nga.” **abbie** ang pangalan n’ya’y abbie. social worker daw s’ya. pagpasok n’ya’y agad bumungad sa’kin ang asul na bra sa ilalim ng dilaw na blouse nang tapatan ito ng liwanag mula sa bintanang katabi ko. sa kanyang pagtali ng buhok ay nakita kong basang-basa na ang kanyang kili-kili at kumikinang na sa pawis ang kanyang leeg. “alex?” sabi n’ya habang maya’t-mayang tinutulak ng kanyang daliri ang salamin n’yang dumudulas sa kanyang matangos na ilong. “bakit di mo ikwento muna sa’kin ang nangyari bago tayo umalis dito?” pasensya ka na, abbie. hindi ko nagawang sabihin kay chairman, na kilala pa mandin namin. hinding-hindi ko rin masasabi sa’yo. walang ibang maglalahad ng nangyari kun’di ang mga taong nais magbigay kahulugan dito, kasi kung ako tatanungin kung bakit, sa totoo lang, hindi ko rin alam ang isasagot. may nabasag akong bote sa kusina kanina, at sa pagpulot ko nito’y pumasok sa isip ko ang isang udyok. yung tipo ng udyok kapag nasa mataas kang lugar, at bigla mo na lang gustong itulak ang kasama mo. pero alam mong hindi ito dapat gawin, at kakapit ka pa nang mas mahigpit sa kanila para masiguro mong hindi ito mangyayari. ang udyok na ito’y nagsabi sa’kin na isaksak ko kay kuya ang basag na bote. at nalaman ko na lang na totoo na pala ang lahat nang dumapo sa aking balat ang mainit na dugo ni kuya. nahinto lang ako nang maramdaman ko ang buto sa leeg n’ya at nang marinig kong nabibilaukan na s’ya sa kanyang sariling dugo. hindi ko pa rin alam kung bakit. sana, tulad ng iniisip ni chairman, ay nasapian na nga lang ako. pero nakita ko ang lahat, andun ako. hindi ko lang alam na totoo pala ang lahat. namatay si kuya joe sa wala. at hindi ko matanggap na wala. normal lang sana ang sabado namin. tahimik. nanonood lang si kuya ng tv, naglilinis ako sa kusina. si nanay nama’y namamalengke ng pananghalian namin. bicol express daw ang lulutuin n’ya. puta, sinira ko ang araw. gusto kong umiyak dahil hindi na kami babalik sa salo-salo namin. “alex?” muling tawag ni abbie. “gusto kong malaman kung bakit. tayong dalawa lang. kaibigan mo ko dito. hinding-hindi ko ‘to sasabihin sa nanay mo, sa mga kapitbahay n’yo. may mga naririnig ako sa labas na dahil daw sa inggit? totoo ba ‘to? sa inggit nga? magmula nang dinala ako ni chairman dito sa maliit na kwartong ito’y napagpasyahan kong manahimik na lang sa nangyari. sa ngayo’y nilalabanan ko ang mga luha, nilalabanan ko ang panginginig ng aking bibig, at ang mga salitang gustong lumabas mula sa’kin. dapat mukhang hindi ko pinagsisisihan. dapat mukha akong galit. para naman mabigyang halaga, mabigyan ng ibig-sabihin ang pagkamatay ni kuya joe. dapat tinatatak ko sa utak ko na dapat lang! dapat lang sa kanya ang nangyari. dapat hindi ako bibigay. dahil kapag natalo ako, mamatay talaga sa wala si kuya. “sige, kung ayaw mong magkwento, ako muna. kasi naalala ko ‘tong isang batang babae at ang tatay n’yang abusado. tatay n’yang lasinggero. tatay n’yang isang beses s’yang hinipuan sa kanyang sariling kwarto at pinilit. ampon ang batang ‘yon, at tatay-tatayan n’ya lang etong umaabuso sa kanya. takot na takot ang bata dahil pakiramdam n’ya isang gabi’y papatayin na lang s’ya bigla neto. kaya naman isang gabi, nang bigla s’yang pinuntahan ng kanyang tatay upang pagsamantalahan ulit, sinasaksak ito ng bata gamit ang lapis sa mata, sa leeg, at sa dibdib.” kumuha ng panyo si abbie. sa kanyang paggalaw ay muling sumisilip ang kanyang bra sa likod ng blouse na parang mga batang naglalaro sa likod ng kurtina. “masarap sa pakiramdam, pero pumapatay pa rin s’ya ng tao. ilan taon n’yang dinibdib ‘yun. hanggang ngayon nararamdaman pa rin n’ya ang mga kamay ng tatay n’ya sa kanyang ari. sa kanyang dibdib. ilang taon bago n’ya matanggap ang ginawa n’ya. ngayon, medyo mahirap pa ring ikwento, pero kahit papaano’y kaya ko na. nangyari na kasi.” para bang may sumuntok sa aking dibdib nang marinig ko ‘to. bigla kong tinanggal ang aking paningin sa kanyang bra, at sa paggalaw ng aking mga mata’y bigla kong naramdaman ang pamumuo ng mga luha. “ayos lang, alex. pero andito lang ako. aalagaan ka muna namin. tapos pag handa ka na, makikinig ako. kahit pakonte-konte pa, ayos lang. aantayin kong mabuo ang kwento mo.” bumibilis bigla ang tibok ng puso ko. lalong nanginginig ang aking labi. at biglang pumasok si kuya sa isip ko, tumatakbo papalayo sa akin. mga bata pa kami, at hinahabol ko s’ya. “alex?” kuya wag kang lumayo! “alex?” kuya dito ka lang! kailangan kita dito! “sige, ayusin na natin pag-alis mo.” at parang isang batang nadapa sa semento, dito na walang awat na tumulo ang luha sa aking mga mata. “alex?” “hindi ko rin alam… hindi… ko rin alam. sorry, kuya! sorry! hindi ko rin alam kung bakit! patayin n’yo na lang ako! hindi ko alam anong nangyari! hindi ko na kaya!” lumalabo na ang aking paningin, pero kahit ga’no kalabo ang aking mga mata’y kitang-kita ko ang gulat at takot sa mukha ni abbie. pasensya ka na, kuya.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/nlygsa/alex_tanghaling_tapat_ng_sabado_2021/,27 05 2021

a day in the life of a 88m supporter,"may kausap ako kahapon 88m supporter tungkol sa kwento ng buhay. nagki kwento cia sakin ng mga nangyayare sa bansa ngayon. hindi ako sumasagot. nakikinig lang ako. naka open ang facebook niya. kwento kwento lang siya tungkol sa kung ano ang nasa balita at buhay ng mga pinoy ngayon. ramdam ko gusto niyang maging masaya ung kwentuhan namin, parang may sense of pride ba. parang may feeling of victory or happy moments kasi para sa kanya nanalo nga. nakatutok siya sa comment section at iba’t ibang facebook groups, daig pa niya nanonood ng boxing sa gigil at excitement. pero sa tingin ko, alam naman niya na hindi 88m ang binoto ko. nakikinig lang ako. okay naman daw. kesa kay leni na lugaw. nakikinig lang ako. hanggang sa maya maya lumabas na ang totoo. ung kwento ng taas ng pamasahe, piso laban sa dolyar, presyo sa palengke, ang gastos dumoble pero ang sahod wala ng kwenta. nung una, umiikot sa ulo ko ung galit kasi hindi sila nakinig. nung bumoto ako kayo pinaglaban ko, pero kalaban pala ang tingin niyo sakin. pero kalaunan, awa na ung nararamdaman ko pag naririnig ko sila. nalagay sila sa isang sitwasyon na wala ng atrasan kasi andyan na. at gusto man nilang tumiwalag, wala na silang magawa kasi lutong luto na ang utak nila na wala ng ibang dapat mamuno sa bansa kundi ang manok nila at anoman ang kahihinatnan ng bansa sa kanila ay ayos lang, tatanggapin, pag titiisan kasi may diyos naman daw. na npa ka kasi kumokontra ka. isa kang terorista na walang ibang plano kundi sirain ang bansa. dilawan ka. na ang parang goal ay patumbahin ang mga kokontra. siraan kung kinakailangan at kasuhan ang mga nagsasabi ng totoo na para sa kanila ay paninira. maniwala sa kung sino-sino, mali daw ang sinasabi ng mga libro. na okay lang mag tiis kasi ganun daw talaga ang buhay at huwag umasa sa gobyerno. at kung ano ano pa. nakikinig lang ako, bilang respeto. kahit papaano, nasa isip ko maswerte pa rin pala ako. natalo lang ang laban at pinaglaban ko sa naganap eleksyon pero hindi nawala sa tama ang pag iisip ko. pag nakikita ko silang pabalik balik sa pila, nag aantay ng libreng masasakyan habang ako kahit papaano kumportable habag ung nararamdaman ko. pero kahit ganoon, nakikita ko rin naman sa kanila na masaya sila sa ganun kwento ng buhay at yun ang realidad. masakit na realidad na kailangan makita ng lahat. na may mga tao na masaya na sa ayuda na okay na sila sa ganun klase ng buhay at malaking bagay yun para sa kanila. so ano ang plano ko? wala. natauhan rin ako kasi hindi ko pala dapat sila iniintindi. na hindi ko obligasyon na isipin sila lagi dahil lang sa nakikita ko na nagkakaganyan sila. nabukasan ang isip ko na sanay na sila sa ganyan buhay. normal na yan sa kanila. pero hindi ko rin naman nakikita ang sarili ko na sasaya kasi ganyan sila. tao pa rin naman ako. siguro, oo, may paminsan minsan na papasok sa isip ko na “deserve” pero pipigilan ko. siguro hanggang dun lang muna ako. nararamdaman ko rin kasi na habang bumaba ang kalidad ng pagiging isang tao ngayon. na hindi na yata ang uso ang nag iisip, nagbabasa at gumagamit ng utak naamoy ko na matagal tagal tayong mapagsasamantalahan. siguro, oo. naisahan nila tayo. pero pakiramdam ko pinagbibigyan lang sila ng mga tao, inuunawa, kung paano natin tinatanggap at pinag papasensyahan ung mga mahal natin sa buhay na alam naman natin na wala talagang maasahan. pero nag uumpisa pa lang ang laban. bawat taon may mga uusbong na bagong botante. at sila ung bagong pag asa para sa bagong hinaharap. mga kabataan, kayo na ang bahala sa amin. sa inyo kami naka asa. imulat niyo ang mga mata niyo sa tama at mali dahil kapag nakapag desisyon kayo ng tama, kayo ang mas makikinabang sa mga desisyon niyo. at para sa mga kagaya namin na nandito na, malas lang namin talaga dahil samin natyempo ung ganitong klase ng sitwasyon. sa susunod na pagkakataon ang sarap sigurong itanong, “masaya po ba kayo sa sitwasyon natin lahat ngayon?!”",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/xlhqol/a_day_in_the_life_of_a_88m_supporter/,23 09 2022

What does Albularyo do (witch doctor/folk healer)? Do they really do something? May naniniwala pa ba sa kanila in this generation?,"so i have a brother, he's 25 year old. we rushed him twice in the hospital this week. pero prior pa sa mga episodes na'to, he's feeling symptoms already eg. tightness of chest, nagka-cramps ang katawan niya, difficulty sleeping, nahihirapan huminga, etc. after all the medical exams, okay naman lahat ng results niya, normal lahat ng test. a friend of his advised him to go to albularyo (which i am against kasi i think he's having mental health problems talaga which affects he's overall being since yung mga symptoms niya ay linked to anxiety and depression eg. panic attacks/difficulty breathing). but i just let them para sa peace of mind na rin na atleast we all did everything possible kahit na talagang kapos kami, we just don't want him to feel na pinapabayaan namin siya. so fastforward kung saan pumunta yung albularyo sa bahay, wala naman siyang masyadong ginawa. may sinabi na may lumalaro raw sa kapatid ko (nangkukulam daw sa kanya), mas marami pa actually yung pagboboast niya na he's done something for someone, na siya yung reason kung bakit nalaman kung sino yung kumuha sa wallet ng isa niyang pasyente (?). he's just engaging us in the conversation. he also said na yung mga ibibigay niyang papakuluan at iinumin ay exported pa raw and such. and to my surprise p4000 lahat yung siningil niya for that session only. he's not the typical albularyo rin, naka-car siya and mukha namang well-off. do you think reasonable yun as bayad? i mean, may mga naririnig naman na akong albularyo before pero usually hindi ganun kalaki ang hinihingi nila. since parang act of altruism yon in their part since meron silang god-given gift. i don't have anything against sa mga albularyo or naniniwala/nagpeperform nga mga ganoong rituals pero i felt robbed for me and sa kuya ko kasi we chipped in sa bayad. malaking bagay na yon para samin, he's living paycheck to paycheck and i'm still reviewing for my boards so big deal talaga yun sakin. and if ever may magtanong kung bakit hindi ko na lang sinuggest na magvisit ng psychologist. it is still not acknowledge sa amin, especially sa pamilya namin. and simply not accessible. (how can i put it into words) parang still stuck sa phase na ""nasa isip mo lang yan."" bottomline, are albularyos a thing? am i just overreacting sa bayad? edit: i'm reading all your comments guys and i really appreciate them. pero hindi ko lahat ma-process right now kasi my manung just talked to the albularyo, and he's asking him 5k kasi may ritual daw silang gagawin bukas and he's gonna bathe him with god knows what and how, at hindi pa sure kung yun na yung last na hihingin niya. and he assured him daw na 'pag 'di gumaling, ibabalik daw yung binayad. i really can't process anything right now kasi i'm thinking na baka this is only the beginning nung mga paghingi hingi niya, and knowing my brother he really won't listen to any of us. edit: please don't share this with any platform update: i took your advice guys and told him na he should instead see a therapist since malaking bagay yung hinihinging 5k. i also forwarded informative videos na very similar sa mga symptoms na nafifeel niya na linked to anxiety. unfortunately, umutang daw siya ng pambayad and binayaran na niya. and he won't acknowledge yung idea na maybe he has anxiety. sobrang close minded niya with regards doon. i'll just hope and pray for the placebo effect.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/17nhpid/what_does_albularyo_do_witch_doctorfolk_healer_do/,4 11 2023
Truth why children struggles for reading comprehension in my POV,"i have worked part time as an assistant for my late mother when she was a teacher until she became a principal so i think i'm qualified to post this at least. so bakit nga nagiistruggle ung mga bata especially reading comprehension, what's happening within the school system and this is what i observed for 8 years i have worked in deped. 1. teachers are being worked for community services like feeding programs. imo dapat lgu services ang gumagawa nito not teachers. isa ito sa mga matrabahong ginagawa nila kaya nababawasan ang attention sa bata. pinakahassle dito ung liquidation which really drains the life out of you. 2. teachers are being worked for data reports instead of adding an employee for the task. isa ito sa mga pinakaiinisan ng mga teachers. not just time consuming, nakakalito pa sa dami ng data kailangang ipasa sa deped within a short period of time. the higher-ups mentality: kung ayaw mo humanap ka ng ibang trabaho (what a nice way to motivate teachers amiright?!). this job causes teachers para tamarin ng magturo, imbes na lesson plan ang inaatupag nasa data reports na, kaya paggawa ang grades ng bata dinaig pa na galing sa rekto para hindi na sakit sa ulo. also teachers have a hard time adjusting to technology especially yung mga nagstart pang nagturo since 90's era na nasanay na sa papel kaya madaming pinaparework na reports which again causes them to advert their attention from the students. 3. ito masakit: deped really doesnt give a fuck about children performances. totoo naman eh, they only care about the data they demand from the schools wether it is invented or not basta napirmahan at naaprubahan bahala na yung bata kung marunong o hindi. ang bottom line ng mga teachers kung bakit imbento na yung grading especially sa reading comprehension dahil sa reasons 1 & 2 (dagdag mo pa yung mga bata na ayaw matuto). also matrabaho ang magparemedial reading at apektado din grades mo as a teacher dahil mababa ung grado ng reading comprehension ng bata habang naghahabol ka ng data reports ng deped(o diba ang dami). so anong solusyon? ipasa mo nalang kahit hindi marunong. wala man lang akong nakitang employee na nagveverify ng reading comprehension ng mga students. basta ang kalakaran as long as papers goes it goes. 4. corruption in deped and broken promises. my mother (school principal) and her teachers are always promised laptops since 2017 pero walang dumadating. during their seminars laging pinagmamalaki ng regional supervisor for this annual budget at magkakaroon sila ng makabagong gamit. welp never happened, outdated parin laptops ng mga teachers, i think 2015 pa ata ung models na ginagamit ng mga teachers dito ofc im not going to disclose the location. this mostly started during duterte's term pero nung kay pnoy madami laging bagong learning materials at libro hindi pa masyado uso laptops noon. demanding ang deped pero hindi progressive yan ang katotohan sadly. out of touch ang higher-ups sa mga front liners kaya tayo umabot sa ganito. teachers works are overloaded and demanding yet underpaid. so kung may opinions pa kayo just comment down below.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/wsv9x2/truth_why_children_struggles_for_reading/,20 08 2022

My thanksgiving dinner experience with a BBM family.,"so eto nga guys, nag-punta kami (me (f), my wife (f) my sister and her bf) reluctantly sa invitation ng ilocano-bbm tita na kapit-bahay namin. may pinag-samahan naman yung family kahit papano, before elections super ganda ng communication namin sa kanila kasi kapitbahay namin dito sa canada. saktong usapan lang, nag-dasal kami bago kumain. to be honest, ang ganda nung prayer. as an agnostic, na-appreciate ko naman siya. pero gagi, yung kapatid ko brining-up yung pag-unfriend ko sa tito ko na misogynistic bbm supporter din tapos sabi sakin bigla nung bbm na tita: ""kayo kasi maka-leni kayong lahat diba? dapat di na kayo nagpapa-niwala sa kwento kwento lang. dapat sa totoong news sources lang."" mind you, binigyan ko lang siya nuon ng heads-up na fake yung website source niya (halatang fake kasi no actual sources from credible organizations, news sites, people, also the ones she sent me usually walang https:// (unsecure-doesnt mean all with https:// are legit as well) tapos yung design nung buong site, parang cult na may agila, illuminati sht - web designer and dev ako) tapos kinimkim pala niya yun. di ko nalang tinuloy yung pag-rebut ko kasi yung wife ko natatakot na magalit ako. i was very polite about it kasi mas matanda siya sakin and i was just looking out for her. then na-bring up nanaman ng kapatid ko about yung recently nangyari kay leila de lima. gagi nagulat ako sabi ng panganay niyang babae, ""dapat pinatay na nila yun. tinuluyan na dapat sinaksak."" sabay silang pamilyang tumawa (aside sa bunso na awkward sa situation) i felt chills. paanong nakakapag-dasal ng ganun kaganda tapos without any hesitations, would wish harm on other people just like that. ps. sinabihan din nung bbm tita yung mom ko directly bakit ako nag-cocomment and nag-popost na kumakalaban sa views niya. tas sabi ni bbm tita ""isang post mo nalang eh sasampalin na kita."" sabay tawa. eto din isang kinagalit ko sila yung traditional toxis filipino family. lakas nilang i-body shame yung asawa ko sa harap ko? muntik na talaga nag-liparan ang mga lumpia. anyways, officially cut ties with them na. may bbm supporter akong mga kakilala pero not that extreme (madalas dahil lang kasi ilocano. &nbsp; &nbsp; (edit) just to answer some questions. &nbsp; > quote q1. why was politics bough up nung dinner? i did not want to talk about politics because i knew it was going to be a mess, pero my sister thought our casual arguments sa fb nuon nung tita is civil and casual. she thought wrong. she had no idea the tita was extremely pro-marcos. she tried to change the topic but we decided na umalis bago magka-gulo (because i get really unpleasant pag nasimulan ko nang magalit and isa yun sa puna ng wife ko sakin kaya ayaw ko siya lalo ma-stress) anywho, lesson learned sa kapatid ko lol &nbsp; >quote q2. di bako sumagot or stoop up for what i believe in? i tried. di sa pag-tanggol sa pagkatalo or sa binoto ko, pero sa misinformation na nagbblur sa totoo at hindi. ang sagot sakin ""naniniwala ka kasi sa fake news. dun ka sa totoong balita lang. wag sa kwento kwento sa facebook at tiktok."" can't argue with people who always things they're right. siya nag-banggit na kay leni kami nag-vote last election and my side of the family all nodded (said ""yes. syempre tita."") then she proceeded to complain about the philippines being poor right now and then overcompensating sa pag-puri kay bbm after niya magreklamo. lol also i don't ever want to stoop low para makipag-sampalan at murahan sa harap nung bunso nila (na awkwardly listening to her mom talk about marcos. i guess she's the ""odd"" one in the family.) &nbsp; >quote q3. but they body-shamed your wife? di ka pumatol? as mentioned i can become harsh pag galit ako. my wife doesn't like me when i'm at that point of anger kaya we just looked at each other and signaled na umalis na. although i told them my wife is building strength kasi nag-ddeadlift siya. di nila alam ata kung ano yun. tbh nung tumahimik ako, napansin nung bf ng sister ko and akala daw nila may gagawin ako. i'm honestly surprised i held it in like that. i'm quite proud of myself. charot &nbsp; >quote q4. important ba sila sa inyo? nung bago-bago palang kami sa canada isa yung tita na nagshashare ng food niya samin sa work, nag-lolook out for us and genuinely concerned if we were okay. kaya masakit din na this happened. &nbsp; >quote q5. anong nangyari sa fresh lumpia? binigyan kami ng pa-take home pero wala na gusto kumain. binalik ko yung plate nila kahapon pero di ko na kinausap. iniwan ko nalang sa pinto nila. &nbsp; &nbsp; >quote edit: clarified that not all websites with ""https://"" are legit din.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/y1fwdi/my_thanksgiving_dinner_experience_with_a_bbm/,11 10 2022

Pet Euthanasia,"kindly asking kung may alam kayo na vet or clinic na pwede mag euthanize ng pet? my baby (4 month old puppy - turning 5 on dec 26) was diagnosed with two types of cancer. one is leukemia due to the large amount of white blood cells and increased number of neoplastic cells. then sabi ng vet positive din for another type of cancer found in her red blood cells. we fought hard to keep her alive (spent a good amount of money just to get her the meds and tests she needed) honestly, oo gusto ko padin sya mabuhay nang matagal but unfortunately the signs are not really good na. she's slowly loosing her appetite. i've been force feeding her since the first week of november pa. lagi nalang sya nakahiga. tatayo at lalakad lang sya pag pupunta ng training pad to pee and poop. loose nadin yung bowel movement nya and may traces of blood nadin sa stool. may times padin na nakikitaan namin sya ng will to live. pag kinaka usap namin sya, nag wa-wag padin yung tail nya. lumalaban yung isip nya. pero gusto na yata bumigay ng katawan nya. ayoko sana gawin to pero if needed, saan ako pwede magpa euthanize for my baby? ang hirap sabihin. ang hirap gawin. masakit. sobra. pero baka kailangan ko na na sya i-let go. my faith is being tested. this is unfair. i did everything to take good care of her. complete vaccines, complete deworming sessions. getting her all the stuffs she needed. di ko pa pinapalabas ng house due to fear of viruses pero bakit yung baby ko pa yung pinahirapan ng ganito. she doesn't deserve this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/k8yxtp/pet_euthanasia/,8 12 2020

The 6th Stage: Defiance,"so, ayun na nga. ibang mundo na ang ating gigisingan. the dragon has fully reared its head. duterte coming into power in 2016 was but a tendril of smoke heralding the return of a marcos-with an all new cast of cronies! super. ngayon, sabay sabay natin matututunan ang totoong ibig sabihin ng pagtindig laban sa karimarimarim na dilim. tulad ng paglaban ng mga lolo’t lola, nanay, at tatay natin nung 1972. training wheels are off. totoo nga na papunta na tayo sa exciting part. nakakatakot. nakakapangilabot na yung dating mga binabasa mo lang, napapanuod mo lang sa dokyumentaryo, baka makita mo na sa mundong ginagalawan mo. nung una, i did not know how to cope, so lahat ng brand ng copium tinikman ko. hagulgol. galit. ang bobobo, ang tatanga! nangangako ng aalis na. alexa, show me afams in my area. but curiously, as the most turbulent of the emotions eased, something remained. tahimik lang siya habang inuubos ng kaluluwa ko ang kalungkutan. ngayon na humihina na, mas naririnig ko siya, unflinching and steadfast. i feel defiant, *in a way that i have never felt like in my life*. baka ang tadhana ni vp leni ay hindi ang manalo noong may 9, kundi sindihan ang totoong kilusan. marami satin, siguro parang namatayan ngayon. pero may nabuhay rin. it’s new, tentative. pero it is a force that cannot be denied. rivulets of water that will eventually cleave apart solid stone. yung grit ng mga tao na nanatili hanggang 6:30am para lang makaboto. this anger? this movement? it is ours. it is *us*. there is no taking it away. sabi nga ni vp leni, ang mulat, hindi na muli mapipikit. pretty words if heard a week ago. ngayon, habang hindi makatulog at makapigil sa pagluha ang marami satin, siguro mas naiintindihan natin ang bigat ng ibig niyang sabihin. it is painful because you know. i believe it is that pain and grief that will keep us moving. masakit maging mulat. masakit hindi bumitaw. madalas ko isipin kung paano ba ako magsusurvive sa rehimen na ganito. hindi ko alam ang lahat ng sagot, pero may apat ako na suggestion na pwede pagsimulan: first: alagaan ang sarili. mahaba pa ang gabi. kailangan maganda't gwapo tayo hanggang mag-umaga. eat well, exercise, hydrate, meditate, stay centered, cry if you need to, know when you need to step away. you will need all of yourself during the coming years. second: mag-ingat online. alam naman natin na kasama sa technique ang red-tagging and troll farms. ingatan ang sensitive and personal information. don’t give them anything to work with. third: digital budd(ies) system. kung ang social media ay tool na ginamit para ilubog tayo, that means we can also use it to work in our favor. gamitin para bumunot ng lakas sa isa’t isa. now is not the time to isolate yourself. if you’re not already doing so, follow inspirational folks like chel diokno and walden bello. kahit hindi lang para sa balita, kahit paalala lang na hindi ka nag-iisa. fourth: do not forget who is really at fault. may magandang video si atty luke espiritu sa page niya sa fb (bawal maglink, pero madaling mahanap) explaining why it is not the masses who are to blame. we gain *nothing* from alienating and attacking each other, while evil counts on us staying divided. yung mga nagsasabi na stop helping para mapressure yung gobyerno, i do not think that will work. this is a government that will not care. we will be punishing the wrong people, and their oppressors will twist the truth to turn us even harder against each other. kung vp leni supporter ka, tulad ng marami satin dito, you would be betraying the principles she stands for. kahit yung mga nakain ng fake news and misinformation, biktima lahat yan. hindi natin alam ilang taon unti-unting binabago ng propaganda ang perception nila ng katotohan. the machinery has been hard at work for years. palagay ko, ngayon palang natin totoong sisimulan ang pagrehabilitate. the real evil are the people who willfully and deliberately voted because they had power to gain. the real evil are the structures and elites who produced marcos jr. yakap. mahal kita at ipaglalaban kita, sa kung paano ko man kakayanin. stay safe, stay defiant, folks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/unpff9/the_6th_stage_defiance/,12 05 2022

"Sorry, but I think the internet is indeed a factor why many people are ""depressed"" right now, BUT that's not necessarily a bad thing.","so i saw this short clip on facebook. galing siya sa isang film featuring tony labrusca. tony told her mom he's depressed, and the mom went ballistic, saying shits like depression is just a trend online. while i don't believe that depression is a trend, i do think the internet is also a reason why more and more middle-class people claim they're depression. sa palagay ko, ito ay parehong panget at mabuti -- pero mas matimbang ang mabuti kesa panget. let's talk about why is it a bad thing first. simple lang: some people might misinterpret this validation, and rather than dealing with their pains, they became addicted to it and became their sort of comfort. kumbaga, the internet validation became a new form of addiction -- gaya ng kung bakit may mga nalululong sa online games, pagkain, at droga. i've observed this a lot in the west. halimbawa nga, some of them gets offended with the word ""fat"" or ""obese"". dapat daw plus-size or the new sexy ang tawag para di masakit sa pandinig. see? rather than dealing with their insecurity, they resorted to demonizing an adjective, and that's a bad thing. nagiging eggshell na ang mga tao, all for the sake of not offending someone who has issues. now, let's talk about the good thing. syempre, unang-una dyan ang validation ulit. gaya rin ng pagkain, online games, and even drugs, wala naman talagang masama sa validation *as long as* you know your limit. most of you probably already know sugar is addicting, and is probably more addicting than marijuana, but hey, we don't hear people asking to ban sugar. even nutritionists themselves aren't saying that. ang lagi lang nilang sinasabi ay hinay-hinay lang. if you consumed it moderately, sobrang helpful iyon sa katawan mo especially if you're physically active. ganoon din sa validation. maraming middle class/rich kid na lumaki sa toxic positivity mindset. because of this, their frustrations were forced to repress simply because someone had it worse. pinagdaanan ko rin ito, sa totoo lang. my grandma loves to tell me na swerte ako dahil marino si papa at malaki ang sahod kaya hindi ko naranasan maghirap noon. anong naging epekto sakin? i was forced to conceal my angsts. dahil hindi ko mailabas, naipon lang nang naipon sa dibdib ko. parang naging time bomb siya, and it exploded in 2019, after my break-up with my long-term boyfriend. i felt so miserable. i'm still dealing with numbness and suicidal ideation until now. mabuti na lang, i have a good support group. gusto ko sanang mag-therapy pero ayoko kasi ng epekto ng gamot sakin, so i chose not to seek it. what could have happened if iba ang upbringing ko? i probably would have a better coping mechanism. right now, my coping mechanism is being workaholic, since it helps me distract myself from pain, pero hindi rin maganda ito. dami ko ngang pera pero di naman ako masaya sa buhay ko. that's why right now, i'm learning to balance my social life and work. heck, pati sex life and fitness, i'm slowly incorporating it to my lifestyle. isa pang bagay na maganda sa awareness ng mental health online ay yung mapuputol na natin ang siklo. let's admit it, one of the reasons why the gen xers and the generation earlier romanticized hard work and abuses so much is because ganoon sila pinaniwala. kaya nga karamihan sa mga toxic boss at customer ay mga galing sa henerasyon na ito. karamihan sa kanila ay mayroong anger management issue. naalala ko nga sa first job ko, i was bullied by my workmates, who are mostly 40+ and older. natutuwa kasi boss namin sakin dahil mabilis ako magtrabaho, and these people saw me as a threat, so they're bullying me through cold treatment. tapos lagi pa akong pinagchichismisan, at hindi rin ako sinasabihan kapag may announcement. it’s affecting my job a lot. so iyon, umalis ako after six months. nagalit si tita ko sakin, saying i should just shrug it off. imagine, rather than saying ang toxic ng ka-work ko, ako pa ang mali? but then, iyon kasi ang kinagisnan nilang buhay. through the mh awareness, the younger generation can break this cycle. we learn to be kinder and be less tolerant to bullshit like this, and i think that’s the best part. after all, bukod sa mali naman talaga ang bullying, counterproductive din ito, lalo na sa office. halimbawa na nga lang itong experience ko sa first work ko. natutuwa si boss sakin because i’m efficient. that efficiency decreased because of the bullying. remember, from an economic perspective, productivity loss will also result in income loss, which sadly many insecure coworkers didn’t know. hindi lang ako ang apektado kundi ang kumpanyang pinagtratrabahuhan nila. in the long run, sila rin ang maapektuhan sa ganitong kultura. and speaking of efficiency, mh awareness also improves it. think about it: hindi ka makakapagtrabaho nang matino kung burnt out ka, hindi ba? and this is not just anecdotal evidence. years ago, microsoft japan conducted a study to know what would happen if they implement a 4-day work system. japan is notorious for their overworking culture, so this is frowned upon. and surprisingly, mas malaki pa ang income nila during the time 4-day work happens. mas productive ang mga tao dahil hindi sila masyadong pagod. hindi rin uso yung pinapabagal ang trabaho para lang mapagkasya ng eight hours ang pwede sanang gawin within 3-4 hour. and nakatipid pa sila sa operating expenses dahil tatlong araw na walang gumagamit ng office. see? efficient, and it all started because microsoft is trying to improve the mental health state of their employees. the verdict? the internet does play a factor on why more people are self-diagnosing. but if you think about it, the benefits outweigh the liability. hindi lang natin natutulungan ang mga tao, but it would also improve the economy. it’s a win-win suggestion. recommendation? normalize validating your pain, but don’t overdo it as it would lead to addiction in the long run.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/oco9gn/sorry_but_i_think_the_internet_is_indeed_a_factor/,3 07 2021

My FlipTop Ahon 13 - Day 2 Experience,"just woke up late in the afternoon due to the exhaustion i had experienced and i just want to share this. let me preface this by saying i don’t mean to offend or disrespect the fliptop staff, emcees, and especially anygma with the some of the things that i’ll say in this long post. this is the 4th event that i have attended alongside with my partner, and we both have a great time whenever we go to their events. with that being said, ahon 13 - day 2 was memorable in the worst way possible for both of us. the way that the event should play out is that there 10 battles and the flow of the event should be like this: 3 battles -> short break -> 3 battles -> short break -> 2 battles -> short break -> 2 battles. note that the rap battles averaged around 30 mins. each. the last 2 battles are the match between sinio vs apekz that fans have been eagerly waiting for almost 5 years to happen, and the isabuhay 2022 finals between pistolero vs luxuria. specifically, the sinio vs apekz match is the single reason that most fans are attending this event. okay, so the first battle was between g-clown vs jr-zero (great battle btw). when the battle was about to start, electricity went out in the venue. may bumigay ata sa circuit breaker. anygma told us that to wait for about 40 mins to fix the situation. after waiting for about an hour, electricity came back and the first battle was able to start with no further issues. then the second battle started, which is the royal rumble match between sur henyo vs kregga vs batang rebelde vs lil strocks vs bagsik. this is when another problem of the venue has started to rise. the venue by the way is asuncion badminton court in san juan, manila. it has a narrow entryway which is not really a problem for a badminton court. around second battle ay napansin ko na dumami na mga tao sa venue, kahit yung entryway para sa gen ad at vip section ay mapupuno na pati na rin yung 2nd at 3rd floor. halos siksikan na kami sa vip section, at yung partner ko ay umalis na kasi di na raw siya makahinga dahil sa init, hindi siya ganun katangkad compared sa mga ibang tao sa section namin kaya mas ramdam niya ang init. sa case ko naman medyo di na kinaya yung init at nag-alala na sa partner ko ay di ko mabigyan ng full attention ang battle, kaya umalis na rin ako sa vip section at napansin ko na ang dami rin palang gustong umalis dahil sa init. nung nakalabas na ako sa vip section ay sinamahan ko na partner ko sa isang section ng venue na may hangin pa na pumapasok. after matapos yung 2nd battle ay nagkaruon ng mahabang break, may narinig na rin kami sa iba na may nahimatay na rin ibang tao sa crowd. natawa ako sa partner ko nung nag cr siya sa 3rd floor, sabi niya parang nasa bilibid siya dahil sa nakikita niya sa upper floors, mga lalaki nakahubad na mga shirts nila habang naka upo sa railings dahil sa sobrang init. almost 1 hr kami naghintay bago nag announce si anygma na dahil sa critical na sitwasyon namin sa venue ay uunahin na nila yung 3 main event level battles para mabawasan ang mga tao sa venue. the 3 battles are m zhayt vs cripli, pistoleto vs luxuria, and sinio vs apekz. nag stay parin kami ng partner ko sa same section na may hangin pa since rinig naman namin yung mga laban sa speakers. after nung 3 battles ay andami yung nagsi-alisan sa venue, halos 1/4 ng crowd na lang ang natira. around 2 am naka-alis na yung ibang tao sa venue ay kumain muna kami ng partner ko sa food stalls nila, this is also when i used the cr in the 2nd floor for the first time during the event. sabi ng partner ko walang flush yung cr nila sa 3rd floor, sa 2nd floor ganun din pero bruh, may natirang explosion pa sa inidoro tapos ang lawak ng brown puddle ay ma no-choice ka na tumapak dun para maka ihi ka lang. malala rin yung sa 3rd floor nung sinamahan ko partner ko, nasa labas ka palang pero ang tapang ng amoy. i-mention ko na rin na andaming basura sa venue, kulang yung designated trash bags sa venue. sa 2nd at 3rd floor naman wala kang makikita trash bags dun pero daming plastic bottles at beer cans sa tabi tabi. nung nag start na 6th battle between invictus vs fukuda, napansin ko na inaantok na partner ko sa pagod. decided kami na quits na sa event kahit sa gusto naming panuorin yung remaining battles pero halos 10 hrs na kami naka tayo dun sa venue eh hindi na talaga kinaya ng katawan namin ang pagod. tumambay muna kami sa mcdo na malapit sa venue para kumain ulit at maka-idlip saglit ang partner ko bago kami umuwi. so ayun, our fliptop ahon 13 – day 2 experience, aka san juan city jail experience. baka di lang talaga kaya katawan namin na magtagal sa mga ganung events. i feel bad lang sa mga iba na first time nila maka-attend ng fliptop event tapos ganito ang naranasan nila. hopefully anygma and fliptop staff will learn from this. thank you for having the time to read my long post. edit: i thought that half ng crowd ang nawala after the sinio vs apekz battle, but turns out halos 1/4 na lang ang natira upon seeing a pic of the whole venue comparing the crowd before and after their battle.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/zozzn0/my_fliptop_ahon_13_day_2_experience/,18 12 2022

having a gobyernong tapat....,"been reading posts. we're expecting blengblong supporters to realize the lack of change (or decline) in quality of governance. i think the challenge here is that we really havent been able to win with a gobyernong tapat narrative vs the ""golden age ideal"" they had. i assume none of us have even actually had a ph gobyernong tapat ever - hence it takes imagination. so. ang masakit is. theres nothing weve experienced in recent history to compare it against. no standard set that this upcoming ""leadership"" will fail against. basically nothing a few ayudas, roads and bridges could mask. wala eh. itll be historical revisionism. a set of new cronies here and there making a buck. these convicted politicians clearing their names as they go into retirement. anyway quick thoughts ko lang.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/uogyjk/having_a_gobyernong_tapat/,13 05 2022

Tagalized Story.,"may story ako. ako lang ang nag-iisang babae sa pinag-tatrabahuhan kong kumpanya at alam ko na kung bakit. isa akong fresh graduate sa kolehiyo at gusto ko na talagang makapag-simula ng career agad-agad na walang kinalaman sa pagse-serve ng pagkain, pagpupunas ng mga gamit, o pag-dadala o timpla ng kape sa isang matandang negosyante. sa naka-sanayan nag-aapply ako sa trabaho na may anim na araw na trabaho at marami-rami na rin akong interview na napagdaanan. alam ko na ang tinapos kong hrm na kurso ay hindi gaanong makaka-kuha ng magandang oportunidad, pero naniniwala pa rin ako na may mas maganda pang trabaho na naghihintay sa akin. kaya naman nanatili akong positibo, matyaga, at nag-aapply lang sa mga office jobs na may magandang benipisyo. kahit halos wala na akong mapag-kunan ng makakain dahil sa magastos na mga interview, at least mapapag-tibay naman nito ang kakaunting pride na natitira sa akin. halos tatlong linggo na rin ang nakalipas, may isa akong phone interview sa isang internet security company. ang kumpanyang iyon ay maraming offices sa amin at naghahanap sila ng bagong customer support specialist para sa kanilang international department. ang mga requirements ay maganda o mahinahon na boses, good spoken and written grammar, kakaunting tech-knowledge, at may kakayahang mag-trabaho sa umaga at gabi. ang office ay dalawang sakay lang sa mula sa amin, at mayroon silang magandang offer sa health insurance. nag-aapply ako kahit lmitado lang din ang alam ko sa computer science. naging maayos naman ang phone interview at matapos ang dalawang meetings sa hr at sa management, binigyan nila ako ng isang napaka-gandang offer (kahit na wala pa talaga akong experience sa kahit anong trabaho). sa loob ng unang linggo ko, kailangan kong magtrabaho nang regular shift na 9-5 (am) para maging online ako kasabay ng manager ko, na nag-trabaho sa ibang branch ng kumpanya. pagkatapos noon ay kailangan kong magtrabaho para sa regular na schedule ko bilang support - ang schedule ko ay 6 na araw na pasok (09:00 am -05:00 pm (am) at may isang araw na night shift 09:00 pm - 05:00 am respectively). sa unang araw ko, ang suot ko ay isang loose na sweater at mahabang skirt. bilang sa kaalaman ko ay sa ganitong uri ng trabaho ay karamihan mga lalaki ang empleyado, ayaw ko naman mag-cause ng unnecessary attention dahil sa provocatively o inappropriately pag-susuot ng hindi naayon na attire. ang lalaki sa front desk ay mukha namang maayos na tao. pinakilala n'ya ang sarili n'ya bilang si andrew bago n'ya ako tulungang mag-fill out ng mga paperwork at sinamahan n'ya na ako sa aking mesa at sa isang open space na workspace. nakatitig lang ako sa tila walang katapusang mga desks habang naglalakad kami, napansin ko na halos hindi mo makikita ang mga mukha ng bawat taong nagta-trabaho na naka-upo sa bawat desks. wala man lang akong nakita o napansin na babae habang nag-lalakad kami sa tila baga'y walang katapusang workspace na iyon, na talaga namang hindi normal at nakaka-bahala. kahit ang kalmadong presensya ni andrew ay hindi kayang maiwaglit ang wari kakaibang pakiramdam na naka-tuon sa akin. halos maubusan ako ng hininga ng maramdaman ko ang mga presensya ng bagong kong co-workers na tila nagsasabi na ""hindi ka nababagay dito"". nagulat ako ng biglang huminto si andrew sa isang desk na napuno ng mga printed memes, floral stickers, at isang lumang keychain na naka-patong sa harap ng monitor. bukod pa doon ay natatakpan na rin ng makapal na alikabok ang keyboard, monitor at ang natitirang ispasyo ng desk. ""ahhh... anong nangyari..."" sabi ni andrew sa medyo upset na boses. ""pasensya ka na."" sabi nito habang nakatingin sa aking mga papeles. ""ah... aya. dapat matagal na 'tong nalinis. kailangan kong maka-usap ang custodian"". ""ok lang 'yun"", sagot ko. ""puwede ko namang punasan na lang 'yan, wala namang problema"". medyo asiwa na noon si andrew, pero habang ginagala ko ang aking paningin ay malinaw na wala ng ibang bakanteng desk maliban doon. mabilis na natapos ang araw na iyon. natutunan ko na ang mga dapat kung gawin na sumagot sa support related phone calls at gumawa ng bagong ticket para sa system. kailangan ko ring i-monitor ang lahat ng pumapasok na chats at written tickets at isaayos ito base sa level ng urgency at type nito. hindi naman ako required mag-bigay ng technical advice, pero dapat maging pamilyar ako sa aming product software. bilang wala pa namang mga tawag ay pinaki-alaman ko muna ang manual. halos wala akong maintindihan sa mga naroon kaya naman ginogle ko na lang ang karamihan na nasa manual. kinumusta ako noon ng manager ko at mukhang hindi s'ya masaya sa mga lapses ko sa mga materials. dahil pakiramdam ko wala akong matinong nagawa at gagawin sa mga oras na iyon ay panandalian akong nag-break para linisin ang mesa ko. tumayo ako para tanungin si andrew kung saan makaka-kuha ng basahan para sa mesa ko. agad-agad kong pinagsisihan ang desisyon kong iyon. ang bawat mata sa kwarto ay tila napako sa pagtayo ko sa aking kinauupuan. hindi ako sigurado pero maraming mga bulungan akong narinig habang papalayo ako sa aking mesa. ang kaninang maingay na mga keyboard ay pahina nang pahina na halos kainin na ako ng lupa sa sobrang hindi ko pagiging kumportable at self-conscious na rin at the same time. napansin ko na lang na halos halikan ko na ang dibdib ko sa pagyuko para lang hindi ako mapansin. bago ako maka-rating sa isang palikong daan patungo sa front desk ay buong-lakas kong tinignan ang isang tila walang hiyang lalaki na nakatitig sa akin. hindi ko alam kung ano ang inaasahan ko, pero 'yung overall appearance ng lalaking naka-hooding pang-asar na 'yun ay nagbigay ng matinding kilabot sa buong katawan ko. siguro mga ka-edad ko s'ya pero hindi man lang s'ya nahiya o natinag sa pagkaka-titig n'ya sa akin sa kabila ng pagtitig ko sa kanya na may halong pagka-bwisit at inis. isang kakila-kilabot na ngiti ang sumilaw sa mga labi nito habang naka-titig sa parteng bukong-bukong ng aking mga paa at dahan-dahan itong bumalik sa kanyang monitor. inisip ko kung anong magiging reaksyon n'ya kapag tinitigan ko rin ng kaparehong paraan ng pagtitig n'ya sa akin ang tinitigyawat n'yang leeg. parehong reaksyon pa rin ang nakuha ko habang naglalakad ako pabalik sa aking mesa kasama ang box ng computer wipes sa mga kamay ko. may maganda ring nangyari sa araw na iyon. habang nililinis ko ang mga drawer ng mesa ko ay may nakita akong half-used notebook mula sa nakaraang nagta-trabaho sa mesa ko. hindi n'ya nilagay ang first name n'ya, kundi initial lang at last name: j. espiritu. pero, base sa dekorasyon ng notebook, sigurado ako na babae rin s'ya kagaya ko. ang mga naiwan n'yang gamit ay nagbigay ng kapanatagan sa akin, pero 'yung notebook ang talagang pumukaw ng atensyon ko. doon ay sinabi nito ang pina-ikli at simpleng manual gamit ang easy-to-undertand terms at mga explenasyon sa nakaka-litong terminolohiya at komplikadong panuto sa manual. sa tulong n'ya ay nasurpresa ko ang aking manager sa aking product knowledge pagkatapos ng shift ko. matapos ang isang magandang araw ay buong tapang akong gumala sa office at nag-explore sa pantry. binenta ni andrew sa akin ang top-notch coffee machine at snacks sa nasabing pantry, tutal nagugutom na rin naman ako matapos ang isang emotionally, intellectually and productive na araw na 'yun. (ansabe). tsaka, medyo butas na rin 'yung bulsa at namumula na ang mga credit cards ko, kaya naman ayos na ako sa ilang pirasong masasarap na cookies. habang papalapit ako ay may narinig akong malakas na usapan at tawanan sa pantry. sa katangahan ko ay inisip ko na baka naman mas mainit, friendly o kahit maka-tao na sila sa akin. subalit ang maliit na pantry ay napuno ng katahimikan the moment na pumasok ako sa pantry. may limang lalaki doon na mag-kakaiba ang edad at lalaki na naka-upo sa palibot ng isang maliit na lamesa, at lahat sila ay naka-titig na direkta sa akin. ""panget na araw?"" - tugon ng isang pang-asar na boses. agad kong itinaas ang ulo ko mula sa pagkaka-titig sa sahig para hanapin ang pinag-mulan ng boses. hindi naging mahirap sa aking hanapin at malaman na mula iyon sa naka-hoodie na walang-hiyang tumitig sa akin nung nakaraan lang. ""siguro marami ka ng experience?"" - sambit pa nito sa nakaka-asar na tono at may-unting pag-taas ng kilay. ""para makakuha ng komportableng trabaho. siguro sikat ka?"". ""ano 'to, high-school?"" - sagot ko sa malakas na boses. hindi ko hilig kumompronta ng tao, pero sobra na 'to. hostility is one thing, social awkwardness is another, pero pakiramdam ko isa 'tong 80's na high-school drama na mga trenta anyos ang mga bida bilang mga teenagers. ""nandito lang ako para kumuha kape at kung may problema ka sa trabaho ko, puwede mong dalhin sa hr kung ano man ang issue mo"". nagpatuloy ako habang ine-enjoy ang namumutla at pahiyang mukha ng mga taong 'yun. mabuti naman, gusto kong maramdaman nila ang katiting na discomfort na buong araw kung kinakaharap. pinili kong lumayo sa aking mga co-workers, naglakad ako ng taas noo pabalik sa mesa ko na may hawak-hawak na tasa ng kape. bago pa ako maka-upo at enjoyin ang masarap na kape, napansin kong may isang mensahe galing sa hindi kilalang number: ""you have quite an attitude, don't you?"" nanigas ako habang hawak ang cell phone sa isa kong kamay at kape sa kabila. habang prino-proseso ko ang tila breach sa personal security ko, naka-tanggap ulit ako ng dalawa pang mensahe. isa ay ang hubo't-hubad kong katawan na sinend ko sa una kong serious college boyfriend. ang pangalawa: ""bakit hindi mo ngayon ibigay 'yang picture sa hr?"" sa totoo lang, sobrang naapektuhan ako sa invasion ng privacy ko. pumasok ang kahihiyan sa akin at sobrang naiinis ako for drawing so much unwanted attention sa sarili ko. kasalanan ko lahat 'to. pumasok ako sa isang office na puno ng ethical hackers na may pare-parehong pangalan ng aso bilang password. walang duda na ang litratong iyon ay umiikot na sa buong office at lahat ng iyon ay salamat sa walang hiyang ka-trabaho ko, at isa na akong kakatuwang tao sa loob ng office. hindi ko na ginalaw ang kape ko at umuwi na lang, habang pinipigilan ko ang bawat emosyon na bumuhos hanggang makarating ako sa safety ng bahay. halos hindi ako matigil sa kaiiyak nung gabing 'yun, iniisip ko na ang mga mukha ng mga ka-trabaho ko habang tigang na tigang na nakatitig sa hubad kong katawan. mga alas tres na ng madaling araw, doon ko lang na-realize na wala ng kwenta para pa magpaka-lunod ako sa kahihiyan. kailangan kong gumawa ng plano para maka-survive sa ganitong uri ng workplace. quitting is not an option kasi masyadong malaki ang pasweldo nila para tumigil ako. tsaka, halos tinapay na lang ang kaya kong bilhin sa araw-araw. ang pangalawa kong option ay pumunta sa hr, but there's no way i was going to open that can of worms. hindi ko mapapatunayan kong sino talaga ang nag-send ng mga mensahe na iyon. last option? stick with it, keep my head down, gawin ang trabaho na pinasukan ko at 'wag pansinin ang iba pang mga harassment na gagawin nila. 'yun nga ang ginawa ko. sa kabuuan ng isang linggong training ko ay pumapasok ako on time, hindi ako umaalis sa desk ko liban na lang kung pupunta sa palikuran. iniwasan ko rin ang kahit anong contact kanino man at pinanatili ko lang ang aking mga mata sa mga inanimate objects. salamat kay j. espiritu, palagi akong on top ng training ko. sa bawat bagong task na galing sa manager ko, laging may katumbas na entry sa kanyang notebook. wala ng nakaka-gagong texts at face-to-face na kumprontasyon, pero mayroong kakatuwang pakiramdam na panibagong sisira sa kalagayan ko. sa darating na biyernes na ang huling training ko, na nagdala sa akin sa huling entry sa notebook. night shift survival guide: - matulog sa buong umaga bago ang shift at 'wag na 'wag kang matutulog. - walang sino man ang dapat maka-pasok. - panatilihing may pepper spray na dala. (sa kahit anong sitwasyon). - i-check ang bawat aisle, meeting rooms. huwag kalimutang i-check ang ilalim ng lamesa, balkonahe, kitchen tables at kahit likod ng cooler. - laging mag-open ng skype na naka-ready sa emergency in case na hindi gumana ang mobile services. - panatilihing updated sa kaibigan/pamilya/lover kada oras. ang nasabing listahan ay medyo may kahulugan. una, sabi ng hr puwede naman akong matulog sa pagitan ng 2-5 am, basta malapit palagi sa akin ang office smartphone. mayroon nga silang pull out couch sa isang conference room para lang talaga sa ganitong sitwasyon. pangalawa, ang buong shift ay phone calls, kaya palaging may paraan para maka-tawag mula sa office phone, tama? lastly, ang mga naka-outlined sa ""guide"" ay parang o.a at paranoid. siguro 'yung listahan ay satirical? (ewan ko). siguro si espiritu parehas kami ng pakiramdam tungkol sa mga tila patay gutom na mga asong cold-blooded na co-workers? pero 'yung isip ko nag-tatrabaho ng sobra-sobra para makita ang logic sa likod ng mga pag-iingat na ito. may kakatuwa akong pakiramdam na may importanteng impormasyon akong hindi nalalaman. lahat 'yun iniisip ko habang paalis ako ng bahay nung biyernes na 'yun, last day ng training ko. ""andrew"", - dahan-dahan akong lumapit sa kanya. ""puwede ba mag-tanong?"" ""sure thing"", - sagot n'ya na may maaliwalas na ngiti sa kanyang mga labi. ""nagtataka lang ako, bakit wala akong nakikitang ibang support agents. i mean, 'di ba dapat merong at least lima pang tao para ma-cover 'yung six-day rotation cycle?"" ""kailangan mong tanungin ang manager mo tungkol d'yan. most likely naka-kalat sila sa iba pang branch sa syudad. normal lang naman 'yun sa ganoong kaso"", - sagot n'ya. pakiramdam ko tapos na kami sa diskusyon na 'yun matapos s'yang bumalik sa final tasks n'ya para sa linggong iyon. ""meron bang ibang agent na nag-trabaho dito liban sa akin?"" - pagpapatuloy ko, dahil ganun na lamang ang kagustuhan kong malaman ang iba pang detalye sa babaeng nag-fill out ng notebook na s'ya namang ginagamit ko sa buong linggong iyon. ""oo, may isang babae na humawak sa posisyon mo ng panandalian"", - ani ni andrew, habang naka-titig pa rin sa screen ng kanyang screen. pero napansin kong tumigil na s'ya sa pag-tatype o pag-galaw ng mouse. wari ko ay naka-titig lang s'ya sa iisang spot sa monitor n'ya. ""andrew"", - nag-salubong ang mga kilay ko. ""sino 'yung nag-trabaho malapit sa main working space na talagang nakaka-inis? maputla, medyo payat, maitim at kulot na buhok?"" - tanong ko, habang nagpapaikot ng daliri sa bandang ulunan ko para i-describe ang pagkaka-kulot ng nasabing lalake. ""ah... si michael"", - sagot nito, napansin nito ang pagiging iritable ng boses ko. ""may problema ba? ginugulo ka ba n'ya?"" ""hindi"" - sagot ko, pero sa isip-isip ko ay nagtatalo na ang emosyon at sarili ko. ""have a good weekend, andrew"" ""ikaw din"", - sagot nito, halata na may pagtataka sa boses nito habang papaalis ako. sa buong weekend na 'yun ay binabalik-balikan ko ang mga nangyari sa akin sa unang linggo ko. pakiramdam ko may hindi sinasabi si andrew sa akin na importante. wala namang rason para maging iretable s'ya nung nabanggit ko 'yung babaeng nag-trabaho bago ako. may nag-reklamo na kaya kay michael dati? pu-puwede kayang si j. espiritu? si michael ba ang dahilan ng survival guide sa notebook? bakit s'ya umalis? napaka-daming teorya ang bumagabag sa buong weekend ko. bago ko pa nalaman, oras na para bumalik sa trabaho. ito ang araw na talagang sobrang daming trabaho. kahapon ay lunes, ang unang regular day shift. mabilis lang dumaan ang nasabing araw, habang aligaga ako sa pag-sagot ng tawag, recording, sorting at assigning ng dose-dosenang customer complaints sa system namin. hindi sapat ang salitang nasanay na ako at pagkatapos ng araw na 'yun ay sobrang pagod at ubos na ako. saktong maglo-logout na ako, naka-tanggap na naman ako ng mensahe mula sa hindi kilalang number. ""ang sipag mo naman. hindi na ako makapag-hintay na mag night shift ka"" seryoso?! ito ang kauna-unahang mensahe na bumalot sa buong pagkatao ko ng takot. agad-agad kong ginala ang paningin ko kung nasa paligid ba si michael para kumprontahin ko s'ya sa pagse-send ng mensahe, pero kanina pa pala s'ya umalis. matapos kong pakalmahin ang sarili ko, umuwi na ako at sinusubukan kong hanapin si j. espiritu online. ang pinaka best bet ko noon ay sa linkedin, at doon nga ay sinusubukan kong galugarin ang buong listahan ng mga babae na may kinalaman sa proficient technologies na naka-lagay sa profile nila (halos kakaunti lang talaga sila). nung wala akong makita ay pumunta ako kay andrew at doon nga sa friend list n'ya ay sa wakas nakita ko na ang hinahanap ko. may babae na pangalan ay jennah espiritu at unemployed ang status. nag-send ako ng friend request na may mensahe na nag-papakilala at tinanong ko s'ya kung hinarass ba s'ya ng isa n'yang ka-trabaho. sa wakas, pakiramdam ko may patutunguhan na ako, natulog ako at inihanda ang sarili para sa bukas na event. naisip ko na baka may kakaibang mangyayari dahil sa pagbabago ng schedule nung natulog ako ng miyerkules. nag-check ako ng linkedin halos pagka-gising ko mga ala una. walang kahit anong sign kay jennah, kaya naman natulog ulit ako para makapag-handa sa night shift. medyo kinakabahan ako at excited at the same time kasi puwede ko ng mas malibot ang buong place of work ko intimately. dahil walang day crowd, malaya akong makaka-gala at ma-eenjoy ang cookies, dumura sa baso ni michael, kahit ano! may mga iilan pa ring mga nag-tatrabaho nung dumating ako para sa shift ko, pero hindi ko naman iyon pinansin at dahil sa nag-uumapaw na mga tawag at chats na aasikasuhin. makalipas ang dalawang oras, ang bugso ng mga tawag at chats pati mga tickets ay unti-unting bumagal hanggang tuluyan na nga itong tumigil ng sabay-sabay halos alas onse na ng gabi noon. sumandal ako sa kinauupuan ko at ginala-gala ang mga paningin sa aking workspace. wala ng tao noon sa office at least sa nakikita ko. naka-bukas ang lahat ng ilaw pero nung tinanggal ko ang headphones ko, may narinig akong mahinang jingling melody sa hindi kalayuan. para s'yang christmas carol, pero hirap akong tukuyin kong saan ito nangga-galing. wala namang dahilan para matakot ako sa pangyayari, pero pakiramdam ko ang mga nagtayuang balahibo sa mga kamay ko ay nagsilbing alarm. nang tumayo ako sa aking kinauupuan, nawala 'yung melody. well, naging paranoid na ako dati. minsan ko ng inisip na na may lalaking sumusunod sa akin isang gabi hanggang nilagpasan n'ya ako at nagtungo sa kalapit na tindahan sa 'di kalayuan. kahit mag-isa lang ako, lagi kong dino-double at triple check ang mga lock ng bahay bago matulog. aaminin ko na ang mga takot ko ay wala naman talagang basehan. mayroong naka-iwan ng headphones na konektado pa rin sa computer nito at naka-on ang music. o siguro may office party sa ibang kumpanya sa baba ng building. ang makarinig ng kanta ay nakaka-takot lamang sa mga kakatuwang horror movies, 'di ba? 'di ba?! para maka-siguro, hinalughog ko ang office para maka-siguro na mag-isa na nga lang ako. habang naglalakad sa gitna ng mga magkaka-dikit na desks, naisip ko kung gaano ako ka-swerte na mayroon akong sariling corner spot. hindi ko siguro kakayanin na mapalapit sa kahit sinong mga hindi kaaya-aya kong mga co-workers. matapos ko ma-check ang bawat rows ay dumiretcho ako sa front desk area at nagmamasid sa mga kagamitan ni andrew sa paghahanap ng clues. nung wala akong makitang clues ay bumalik ako sa main room ng pantry. unti-unti ng mas nagiging relaxed ang mga senses ko at tsaka ko lang napag-tanto na napasarap ata ang taste-testing ko sa mga cookies sa halip na mag-hanap ng mga kahina-hinalang mga bagay. kailangan ko ng tumigil sa kaka-kain ng cookies, pero dahil bumalik na naman ang kaninang tunog na naririnig ko, mas malakas s'ya ngayon. at the same time, ang work smartphone ko (na kinakailangan dala-dala namin kung aalis kami sa aming work station) tumunog at may mensahe mula sa hindi na namang kilalang number. so, nag-eenjoy ka ba sa cookies, ha? nanigas ang buong katawan ko habang prino-proseso ng utak ko ang mga pangyayari. siguro hindi talaga umalis ng office si michael at ngayon tinatakot ako. kinalikot ko ang tenga ko noon at nakinig ng maigi. walang kahit sino sa pantry as least sa nakikita at naririnig ko. tsaka, kung si michael ay nasa main workspace, hindi naman ganun kahirap na hulaan o sabihin na kumakain ako ng cookies. habang dahan-dahan akong humihinga, hindi ko muna pinansin ang tunog at nakinig ako ng maigi kung may iba pa akong tunog na maririnig. wala. dahan-dahan, naglakad ako sa may pantry drawers at doon may nakita akong malaking kutsilyo. alam ko bang gumamit ng kutsilyo? hindi. kaya ko kayang paalisin kung sino man ang unarmed na kalaban? syempre. papunta na sana ako pabalik sa aking work station ng biglang may tawag na pumasok mula sa work phone. ipinosisyon ko ang sarili ko ng kumportable sa pader ng pantry, kutsilyo sa kanang kamay, cell phone sa kabila, bago pa ako maka-sagot with the standard customer support greeting. nag static na sa kabilang linya at iba pang ingay sunod ang tuluyang pagka-putol ng linya at katahimikan. nung tinignan ko ang cell phone, nakita kong naka-patay na ito. sinubukan kong buksan ulit ito, pero hindi na ito gumagana. ok, ngayon kailangan ko ng bumalik sa computer ko in case na may pumasok pang mga tawag. naalala ko bigla ang isa sa mga guide na galing kay jennah habang isinusuksok ko ang walang kwentang cell phone sa bulsa ko. - laging mag-open ng skype na naka-ready sa emergency in case na hindi gumana ang mobile services. nangyari rin kaya 'to sa kanya? ang mga instructions sa notebook ay unti-unti ng nagkaroon ng kahulugan, at minumura ko ang sarili ko dahil sa pagiging tanga. sa oras na lumabas ang mga salita sa bibig ko ay may isa na namang mensahe ang dumating sa cell phone. kinuha ko iyon at sinubukang i-unlock, pero 'yung regular home screen ay hindi lumalabas. ang lumabas lang ay isang white screen na may maikling text. putang ina. ang mga babae dapat hindi ginagamit ng ganung mga uri ng salita. matapos kong mabasa 'yun ay nawala na ito sa screen at may panibagong text ang lumabas. bakit hindi ka lumabas at makipag-laro? huwag mo ng isiping bitbitin pa 'yang kutsilyong hawak mo. wala ring magagawa 'yan sa hawak kong baril. tinapon ko ang cell phone ko sa lapag at agad-agad ay nagtungo ako sa aking computer. ang tunog ay mas lalong lumakas habang papalapit ako sa aking lamesa, doon ay nakita kong may isang baboy na stuffed toy. may fabric button ito sa bandang paanan at music note na kasama. dito nagmumula ang tunog at nagpapatunay lamang na hindi ako mag-isa at may kung sino akong kasama. ang malala pa, pinapanood nila ang bawat galaw ko at sinusubukang takutin gamit ang mga laruang pambata. unti-unti ng dumadaloy ang pagpapanic sa aking buong katawan at naghahanda na sa fight or flight scenario. huminga ako ng malalim, sinusubukan kong pakalmahin ang buong katawan ko. so far wala pa naman akong naririnig ng kahit anong palatandaan na may ibang tao sa loob ng office. may mga background noises galing sa syudad sa labas at ang mga ingay mula sa naka-limutang patayin na computer ng isang employee. kung sino man ang gumagawa nito sa akin, kailangan kong malaman ang kanilang eksaktong lokasyon para maplano ko ng maayos ang pag-takas ko. isa pa, kailangan kong maka-kuha ng tulong sa lalong mas madaling panahon. habang iginigilid ko ang laruan ay umupo na ako sa aking upuan at pinull-up ang skype for business application. mabilis akong nag-dial ng 911, habang naka-loudspeaker ang telepono. tumunog na nga ang dial tone at agad-agad ay may live operator na sa kabilang linya. ibibigay ko na sana ang mga hindi kanais-nais na pangyayari sa akin ng mga oras na iyon ng may biglang humawak sa bukong-bukong ko mula sa ilalim ng lamesa. halos maubos ang buong lakas ko sa pagsigaw habang nagpu-pumiglas ang mga paa at mabilis na tumakbo sa abot ng aking makakaya sa bilis na hindi ko akaling kaya ko. may narinig akong kung anong kumusyon sa aking likuran habang tumakbo, kasunod ng isang malakas ng putok, na inisip ko na lamang na galing sa kung ano o sino man ang humahabol sa akin. bago ko pa malaman ay halos nasa ground floor na ako papunta sa pinto lagpas sa gwardiya na halatang nagulat sa mga nangyayari. ang malamig na hangin ay mabilis na pumasok sa manipis kong sweater habang papalapit ako sa isang malapit na pedestrian para humingi ng tulong. tumawag sila ng 911 at ang mga pulis ay agad namang dumating wala pang sampung minuto. habang naghihintay ako kasama ang gwardiya para sa kanilang pag-dating, hindi maalis sa isip ko ang sinulat ni jennah na warning, at kung gaano ako ka-tanga para ipagsa walang bahala ang mga ito. - i-check ang ang bawat aisle, meeting room. huwag kalimutang i-check ang ilalim ng lamesa, balkonahe, kitchen tables at kahit likod ng cooler. agad-agad namang sinulat ng pulis ang mga nangyari sa akin at iniwan ako kasama ang isang pulis officer, umakyat s'ya para i-check ang office. wala namang naka-labas-masok sa building mula nung tumakbo ako palabas, kaya malaki ang posibilidad na naroroon pa rin ang salarin at nagtatago sa loob. sa pag-iisip ay halos bumaliktad ang buong sikmura ko at mas lalo akong lumapit sa may armas kong kasama. maya-maya pa matapos kaming iwanan ng mga pulis, ang kasama kong pulis ay nag-radyo at isa-isa may mga boses na nagpapa-palit-palit sa radyo na humingi ng backup at nga mga codes na hindi ko maintindihan. mabilis na nag-escalate ang mga sumunod na pangyayari. imbis na pauwi ay dinala nila ako sa police station at doon ay nanatili ako sa isang interrogation room ng halos 2 oras bago pa sa wakas may dalawang pulis officer ang kumausap sa akin. pagod na ako noon, miserable ang kalagayan at higit sa lahat litong-lito sa kung papaano naganap ang mga pangyayari. gusto ko ng umuwi pero nanatili pa ako ng ilang oras para i-kuwento ang mga pangyayari sa dalawang pulis officer. 'ahh... meron kang kutsilyong hawak habang tumakbo ka galing sa pantry papunta sa lamesa mo? sigurado ka ba?' tanong ng isang nakaka-tandang officer na nagpakilala bilang senior investigator manlapig. 'ah. ah... oo.' pautal-utal kong sagot sa kanya. 'naniniwala akong meron. nag-papanic na ako noon, kaya mahirap sabihin. tapos may baboy na stuffed toy, ' sabi ko, habang tila baga'y nawawalan ako ng abilidad na mag-isip ng tama. 'at naniniwala ka na ang taong humaharass sa'yo ay si michael villareal?' sabi ng isa pang officer, hindi ko maalala 'yung pangalan n'ya. wala s'yang badge. 'hindi ko alam buong pangalan n'ya, pero wala na akong ibang kilala na iba pang responsable.' 'at sa huling pagkakataon, just for the record, anong nangyari matapos mong mag-dial ng 911?' tanong ni manlapig sa ika-apat na pagkakataon sa gabing 'yun. 'may kung sino ang humawak sa binti ko. bukong-bukong, actually. nangyari 'yun bago pa ako magkaroon ng pagkakataong ipaliwanag ang sitwasyon sa operator. nagsusumigaw at piglas ang mga paa ko tapos tumakbo hanggang may makita akong tao sa labas na pina-tawag ako sa 911 para sa tulong.' sagot ko, habang pagod na pagod sa paulit-ulit at paikot-ikot na pagtatanong. 'si michael villareal ay natagpuang patay sa hindi kalayuan ng iyong lamesa nung pumunta ang officer namin sa pinang-yarihan ng insidente. nakita mo ba ang kanyang katawan nung tumakbo ka palabas ng office?' tanong ng isang officer. halos malaglag ang panga ko sa mga narinig ko at tumitig sa dalawang pulis habang balisa at nanginginig sa takot. 'hi.. hi.. hindi,' pabulong akong nag-salita, 'hindi ko maintindihan,' 'sinaksak s'ya hanggang sa mamatay gamit ang malaking kutsilyo. ang katawan n'ya ay balot ng dalawampu't-tatlong saksak,' paliwanag ni manlapig. 'at nakita namin ang kutsilyo ay nakabaon sa bibig nito, dahilan para dumikit ito sa sahig diretcho sa lalamunan,' 'may rason kami para pagsuspetyahan na ito rin ang sinasabi mong kutsilyo,' dagdag pa ng pangalawang officer. nakatitig ako sa dalawang pulis officer ng tahimik, hirap akong intindihin ang mga pangyayari lalo na't ang utak ko ay halos mawala na sa ulirat. 'ang mga sinabi mo ay nagpapatunay lamang sa mga natagpuaan namin sa cell phone ni michael villareal. nalaman namin na may roon siyang hacking apps,' pagpapatuloy ng senior officer. 'natagpuan din naman ang ilan mo pang mga hubong larawan at ang mga mensahe na iyong nabanggit. mayroon s'yang baril at nakita rin naman ang basyo ng bala nung binaril ka n'ya habang papatakas ka.' 'ang hindi namin maintindihan ay kung papaano s'ya namatay.' dagdag pa ng pangalawang officer, halatang hindi s'ya naniniwala sa aking reaksyon. 'ok lang kung napatay mo s'ya dahil sa self-defense, aya. may balak s'yang masama sa'yo.' 'hindi,' pautal-utal kong sagot. 'pangako, wala akong ideya... oh, oh my god.' naiyak na ako dahil sa mga nangyayari. 'ibig kong sabihin, nung nakaraang buwan lang may nag-report sa kanya galing sa isa n'yang co-worker,' sabi ni manlapig. 'jennah,' bulong ko. 'kilala mo si miss espiritu?' tanong ng pangalawang officer, at ng suspetya sa kanyang mga mats. 'hindi,' ako ang pumalit sa lamesa n'ya at nakuha ko ang notebook n'ya. dapat sinabi ko na 'to kanina pa. anong sabi sa report? doon nga ay nagtitigan ang dalawang pulis at maka-lipas ang ilang sandali ay inilatag at ipinaliwanag ni manlapig ang mga hindi magandang nangyari kay jennah na halos mangyari na sa akin. si jennah espiritu ay dumiretcho sa pinaka-malapit na hospital mula sa kanyang unang night shift tatlong buwan na ang nakakaraan. sobrang bugbog ng katawan n'ya at sugatan, at gustong mag-file ng anonymous rape kit. ang natanong damage n'ya sa kanyang puwerta ay sobrang severe na kinailangan n'yang sumailalim sa operasyon at magpatahi. nag-file s'ya ng police report makalipas ang dalawang buwan matapos s'yang hindi pumasa sa probationary period sa inyong kumpanya, ng nawala s'ya sa trabaho (ang nagiisang paraan para mabayaran ang kanyang utang sa hospital). ang nangyari ay ang kanyang aligasyon kontra kay michael villareal, na gumastos s'ya ng malaki sama mo pa ang hindi mabilang na kanyang mga co-workers na kumontra sa kanya laban sa magalang at kaaya-ayang katangian ni michael. 'pero kahapon lang ay iniurong na n'ya lahat ng mga isinampa n'yang kaso kay michael,' sabi ng walang badge na pulis. 'kasalukuyan naming inaalam ang kinaroroonan ni espiritu para ma-interview namin s'ya. sigurado ako na ngayon malinaw na kung bakit may suspetya kami sa iyo bilang nakikilala mo espiritu.' nagpatuloy ang mga tanong ng dalawang pulis hanggang may isang lalaki na nag-abot sa kanya ng isang sobre. natukoy na ng forensics ang fingerprint na nakita sa kutsilyo at ang blood-spatter patterns. kinailangan ko ring mag-submit ng dna samples para maka-tulong sa imbestigasyon at sa wakas ay pina-uwi na nila ako. sa bahay, dahil sa sobrang pagod, hindi ako maka-tulog. wala akong gamit na naiuwi. bag, cell phone at kahit ang jacket ko ay kinailangan i-submit bilang ebidensya. kaya naman napilitan akong gamitin ang luma kong laptop, umaasa na malibang sa internet. ang browser ko ay naka-login pa rin sa linkedin account ko mula sa nakaraang login, at nirefreshed ko ang page bilang naka-sanayan. isang maliit na red icon ang lumitaw na mayroon akong bagong mensahe. jennah. nagre-reply na s'ya sa akin. don't worry, sis. i took care of it. ❤️",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/t77k69/tagalized_story/,5 03 2022
Who is the best knee surgeon in Manila? We need ACL reconstruction for a teenage family member.,"we have a teenage football player in our family who was recently injured, and the doctors say that acl reconstruction is necessary. does anyone have any recommendations for knee surgeons in the manila area? ideally, we'd like to look at the option of an allograft (from a donor) instead of a autograft (harvested from another part of his body), but the doctors seem to think that we'd have to go out of the philippines to get that. we haven't made a decision, but it would be nice to have the option. i'm hoping that someone knows of a doctor within the philippines with good experience and expertise. thanks in advance. (mayroon kaming isang teenager na manlalaro ng football sa aming pamilya na kamakailan ay nasugatan, at sinabi ng mga doktor na kailangan ang muling pagtatayo ng acl. mayroon bang anumang mga rekomendasyon para sa mga surgeon sa tuhod sa lugar ng maynila? sa isip, gusto naming tingnan ang opsyon ng isang allograft (mula sa isang donor) sa halip na isang autograft (na-ani mula sa ibang bahagi ng kanyang katawan), ngunit tila iniisip ng mga doktor na kailangan naming umalis ng pilipinas para makuha yan. hindi pa kami nakakagawa ng desisyon, pero mas maganda kung may opsyon. umaasa ako na may nakakakilala sa isang doktor sa pilipinas na may mahusay na karanasan at kadalubhasaan. salamat.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/102yvwv/who_is_the_best_knee_surgeon_in_manila_we_need/,4 01 2023

Ang daming naloloko sa mga slimming/beauty drinks ngayon dahil sa mga 'influencers' kuno.,"title. recently lang viral yung post ng isang vlogger sa yt na pumayat raw siya dahil nakatulong raw sa pagpapapayat niya yung drink na yun. di lang naman to yung ni eendorse niya before meron pa yung drink kung saan naissue si doc adam, to which he is right. nutrition student ako btw, and advocate rin ako ng proper and sustainable nutrition para sa lahat ng tao. naawa lang ako kasi maraming nauuto na tao sa mga drinks na yun lalo na sa mga misinformed, hindi mo naman sila masisisi dahil gusto naman nila na gumanda yung katawan, walang masama doon pero yung mga taong nag eendorse ng mga drinks na yun masyadong misleading ang information na binibigay sa audiencw nila to which napapagastos sila, kahit pa sabihin mo na p350 per box halimbawa, malaking bagay na yun para makabili ka ng bigas kahit kaunting kilo lang or pang gastos sa bahay. going back sa mga drinks na yun, ngayon lang binasa ko sa orange app ung ingredients nung drinks na ineendorse ni influencer kuno, wala masyadong sustansya sa totoo lang. kaunti lang yung fiber nun 1g lang, hindi rin naka disclose if soluble or insoluble. dun palang di na siya appetite supressant kasi apaka kaunti naman nun sa fiber intakr ng isang tao, i ddisolve mo pa siya sa tubig na ineexcrete ng katawan as urine. mas okay na yung kumain ka ng kanin, yun talaga busog ka na matagal tagal ka pa bago gutumin ulit. sa sinasabi nilang appetite supressant, jysko tubig lang naman ang ingredient jan na need mo ihalo sa powder, pero sa powder mismo wala namang appetite supressant. hindi mo rin need na i supress ang sarili mo sa mga kinakain mo, kung gutom ka kumain ka, kailangan yan ng katawan mo kahit kaunti basta wag naman sumobra talaga. sana naman tigilan na nila tong panloloko sa audience nila, pinapayaman lang nila sarili nila tapos wala naman long term positive effects sa mga umiinom. baka may mga registered nutritionist dietitians dito sa r/philippines, comment naman po kayo if ano opinion niyo. salamat!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/16vvypz/ang_daming_naloloko_sa_mga_slimmingbeauty_drinks/,30 09 2023

Dapat talaga maging legal na ang divorce sa Pilipinas.,"last year, my aunt's partner of eight years died from sudden cardiac arrest. now, here's the real problem: my step-uncle is married to another woman. no, hindi kabit si tita. separated sila because the legal wife is a cheater. nabuntis ng kuya nung step-uncle ko. now, si tito, gustong magpa-annull pero there's no valid cause and it's freaking expensive pa. so, imagine kung ano-ano ang mga nagpapahirap ngayon sa loob ni tita: \- wala siyang karapatan sa katawan ni tito. ni hindi man lang niya nakita ang katawan bago ni-cremate. \- nasa abroad si tito until three years ago. noong naging sila, nagpundar si tito ng negosyo (palaisdaan) at si tita ang nagpalago noon. syempre, dugo at pawis ni tita ang puhunan pero wala, di rin siya entitled dito. \- pinaalis na si tita sa bahay ni tito. at ang titira doon ay ang legal wife pati yung tarantadong kapatid. \- worst: parehong si legal wife at kapatid ang makikinabang sa lahat ng pera ni tito. at ngayon, walang pera si tita. ni hindi man lang siya hinire sa palaisdaan because the bitchy legal wife wants nothing to do with her. nakakagalit lang. imagine, kumerengkeng siya tapos ngayon, sarap buhay sila sa pera ng niloko niya? guys, this is why i support and will always support divorce. di ko naman kinakailangang manggaling sa problematic na pamilya para ma-realize na mayroong taong deserve na makalaya dito. to all religious bastards who still don't see the problem here, fuck you and your sense of entitlement. hindi ka dadalhin sa langit ng pagiging self-righteous mo.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/mqk8na/dapat_talaga_maging_legal_na_ang_divorce_sa/,14 04 2021
What does Albularyo do (witch doctor/folk healer)? Do they really do something? May naniniwala pa ba sa kanila in this generation?,"so i have a brother, he's 25 year old. we rushed him twice in the hospital this week. pero prior pa sa mga episodes na'to, he's feeling symptoms already eg. tightness of chest, nagka-cramps ang katawan niya, difficulty sleeping, nahihirapan huminga, etc. after all the medical exams, okay naman lahat ng results niya, normal lahat ng test. a friend of his advised him to go to albularyo (which i am against kasi i think he's having mental health problems talaga which affects he's overall being since yung mga symptoms niya ay linked to anxiety and depression eg. panic attacks/difficulty breathing). but i just let them para sa peace of mind na rin na atleast we all did everything possible kahit na talagang kapos kami, we just don't want him to feel na pinapabayaan namin siya. so fastforward kung saan pumunta yung albularyo sa bahay, wala naman siyang masyadong ginawa. may sinabi na may lumalaro raw sa kapatid ko (nangkukulam daw sa kanya), mas marami pa actually yung pagboboast niya na he's done something for someone, na siya yung reason kung bakit nalaman kung sino yung kumuha sa wallet ng isa niyang pasyente (?). he's just engaging us in the conversation. he also said na yung mga ibibigay niyang papakuluan at iinumin ay exported pa raw and such. and to my surprise p4000 lahat yung siningil niya for that session only. he's not the typical albularyo rin, naka-car siya and mukha namang well-off. do you think reasonable yun as bayad? i mean, may mga naririnig naman na akong albularyo before pero usually hindi ganun kalaki ang hinihingi nila. since parang act of altruism yon in their part since meron silang god-given gift. i don't have anything against sa mga albularyo or naniniwala/nagpeperform nga mga ganoong rituals pero i felt robbed for me and sa kuya ko kasi we chipped in sa bayad. malaking bagay na yon para samin, he's living paycheck to paycheck and i'm still reviewing for my boards so big deal talaga yun sakin. and if ever may magtanong kung bakit hindi ko na lang sinuggest na magvisit ng psychologist. it is still not acknowledge sa amin, especially sa pamilya namin. and simply not accessible. (how can i put it into words) parang still stuck sa phase na ""nasa isip mo lang yan."" bottomline, are albularyos a thing? am i just overreacting sa bayad? edit: i'm reading all your comments guys and i really appreciate them. pero hindi ko lahat ma-process right now kasi my manung just talked to the albularyo, and he's asking him 5k kasi may ritual daw silang gagawin bukas and he's gonna bathe him with god knows what and how, at hindi pa sure kung yun na yung last na hihingin niya. and he assured him daw na 'pag 'di gumaling, ibabalik daw yung binayad. i really can't process anything right now kasi i'm thinking na baka this is only the beginning nung mga paghingi hingi niya, and knowing my brother he really won't listen to any of us. edit: please don't share this with any platform update: i took your advice guys and told him na he should instead see a therapist since malaking bagay yung hinihinging 5k. i also forwarded informative videos na very similar sa mga symptoms na nafifeel niya na linked to anxiety. unfortunately, umutang daw siya ng pambayad and binayaran na niya. and he won't acknowledge yung idea na maybe he has anxiety. sobrang close minded niya with regards doon. i'll just hope and pray for the placebo effect.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/17nhpid/what_does_albularyo_do_witch_doctorfolk_healer_do/,4 11 2023

Who is the best knee surgeon in Manila? We need ACL reconstruction for a teenage family member.,"we have a teenage football player in our family who was recently injured, and the doctors say that acl reconstruction is necessary. does anyone have any recommendations for knee surgeons in the manila area? ideally, we'd like to look at the option of an allograft (from a donor) instead of a autograft (harvested from another part of his body), but the doctors seem to think that we'd have to go out of the philippines to get that. we haven't made a decision, but it would be nice to have the option. i'm hoping that someone knows of a doctor within the philippines with good experience and expertise. thanks in advance. (mayroon kaming isang teenager na manlalaro ng football sa aming pamilya na kamakailan ay nasugatan, at sinabi ng mga doktor na kailangan ang muling pagtatayo ng acl. mayroon bang anumang mga rekomendasyon para sa mga surgeon sa tuhod sa lugar ng maynila? sa isip, gusto naming tingnan ang opsyon ng isang allograft (mula sa isang donor) sa halip na isang autograft (na-ani mula sa ibang bahagi ng kanyang katawan), ngunit tila iniisip ng mga doktor na kailangan naming umalis ng pilipinas para makuha yan. hindi pa kami nakakagawa ng desisyon, pero mas maganda kung may opsyon. umaasa ako na may nakakakilala sa isang doktor sa pilipinas na may mahusay na karanasan at kadalubhasaan. salamat.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/102yvwv/who_is_the_best_knee_surgeon_in_manila_we_need/,4 01 2023

Singsing,"mapait akong napangiti nang mapansin ko ang dalawang magkasintahan sa aking harapan. kitang kita ko ang saya sa mga mata ng babae at kung gaano kasincere ang lalaki kung tumingin sa kanya. napatikhim ako at nag-iwas ng tingin ng maramdam kong humapdi ang aking mga mata. dahil ibig ibig ko nang maiyak ng magbalik sa aking ala-ala ang nakaraan. \~ ""mailene!"" saway sa'kin ni ron nang nakawan ko siya ng halik sa kanyang pisngi. masaya kaming nagkakantahan at nagkekwentuhan sa loob ng kanyang sasakyan. binabaybay ang daan patungo sa batangas. ""what? ayaw mo ba na halikan kita?"" nakalabi kong tugon rito at nagcross arms sa kanya. sumilay ang kanyang matatamis na ngiti at kinuha ang aking kaliwang kamay kahit nagmamaneho siya. ""of course not!"" mabilis na sagot nito at saka dinugtong ""gustong gusto kong hinahalikan mo ako, gustong gusto ko yang labi mo kaya dapat kapag hahalikan mo ako yung siguradong nakaharap ako sayo ha?"" idiniin niya ang haplos sa aking palad at hinalikan ang likod nito. namula ako sa kanyang sinabi at tumango. huminto siya saglit sa pagmamaneho at hinatak niya ako palapit sa kanya at masuyong hinalikan ang aking labi. \~ napahugot ako ng malalim na hininga ng maalala ko ang mukha ni ron. napatingin ako sa singsing kong suot at di ko namalayan na basa na pala ang aking mga pisngi dahil sa luha. tumingin ako muli sa magkasintahan sa aking harapan at napangiti sa kanila. sana'y magtagal ang kanilang relasyon. hinatak ko na ang tali ng jeep at agad pumara ng makita ko na nandito na pala ako sa aking bababaan. sinuyod ko ng tingin ang pet shop at tumingin ulit sa aking cellphone upang tingnan ang message na kakatanggap ko lang. ""wait a bit. bumili lang ng ice cream"" napailing ako at napangiti ng malapad ng makita ang isang batang napakaganda sa di kalayuan. ""mom!"" sigaw ni ruine ng makita niya ako dahilan upang mapangiti ako. ""hi baby. how's your day?"" tanong ko at humalik ako sa kanyang pisngi at inayos ang kanyang tali sa buhok. ""super duper good, mom!"" may tumikhim sa'king likuran kaya lumingon ako rito ""ooohhh and tito alex bought me a rabbit"" napabagsak ang tingin ko sa cage na hawak ni alex at nakita ang isang kulay brown na rabbit. ""alex naman."" nakanguso kong tawag dito. he smirked at me at ginulo ang aking buhok. ""ron will be happy, mailene. gusto niya makitang masaya kayo ng anak mo."" sumikip ang dibdib ko sa kanyang sinabi. pinisil niya ang aking pisngi at inabot sakin ang cage upang mabuhat si ruine. alex is ron's bestfriend. siya ang naging father figure ni ruine. siya ang kasama ko noong nanganak ako, siya ang kasama ko ng unang beses magsalita ang anak ko ng ""mama"", siya ang kasama ko noong sinugod ko sa hospital si ruine ng lagnatin ito. si alex ang nagbantay sa amin ni ruine. kahit kailan ay hindi siya umalis sa tabi ko. itinaas ko ang cage na aking hawak at kinausap ang rabbit sa loob nito. ""katulad mo ako, nakakulong ka sa cage at nakakulong ako sa nakaraan."" napakagat labi ako ng marinig ko ang hagikgik ni ruine, napatingin ako sa likuran ni alex at buhat buhat niya ang aking anak. kitang kita ang saya ni ruine sa kanyang tito alex. humalik ito sa pisngi ng kanyang tito at ngumiti muli. sumunod na ako sa sasakyan ni alex, pinaupo niya ako sa passenger seat at inayos niya ang uupuan ni ruine sa likod katabi ang rabbit nito. sumakay na si alex at pinaandar ang sasakyan. nagulat ako ng kunin niya ang aking kamay kaya binawi ko ito sa kanya. ""pasensya na mai"" ngiting malungkot sakin ni alex ngunit di na ako tumugon. tumingin ako sa labas ng bintana habang dinarama ko ang singsing sa aking palasingsingan. \~ ""i promise, ikaw at ikaw lang sa buhay ko mailene."" pangako ni ron sa akin at isinuot sa akin ang singsing na napili niya. ""di pa nga ako nagsasabi ng yes eh!"" maktol ko rito pero nangingiti dahil parang sasabog ang puso ko. ""mahal, di mo man sabihin. alam ko, ramdam ko. pero magtatanong na lang ako ulit ha?"" napakagat ako ng labi ng pumunta siya sa aking likuran. papalubog na ang araw, nakatanaw sa karagatan. nagulat ako ng may naramdaman akong malamig sa aking leeg kasabay ng pagpatak ng luha ko ng may mga lobong paangat at nakasabit rito ang mga salitang... ""will you marry me, mailene?"" ikinabit niya sa leeg ko ang kwintas at iniharap niya ako sa kanya. ""yes, i will marry you ron."" sagot ko sa pagitan ng aking hikbi dahil sa sobrang saya ng aking nararamdaman. mabalis natapos ang aming maghapon sa batanggas at bumalik na sa manila upang ibalita sa kanila ang plano namin ni ron. magkahawak kamay kami. panaka-naka ang tingin niya sa singsing na suot ko. napangiti ako at humarap sa kanya. ""mahal, may surprise ako sayo."" haplos ko sa kanyang pisngi at ngumiti. ""what is it hmm?"" sumulyap siya sakin at hinalikan ang aking kamay. ""i will tell you late--"" hindi ko na natapos ang aking sasabihin ng makaramdam ako ng hapdi sa aking buong katawan, nakakabingi ang ingay, sobrang labo ng paligid, hindi ko makita si ron, hindi ko maramdaman ang aking katawan. napahawak ako sa aking tyan. ""no, please no."" pinilit kong imulat ang aking mata at natanaw ko si ron sa gitna ng kalsada ""ron!"" sigaw ko rito pero hindi ko marinig ang boses ko.

My FlipTop Ahon 13 - Day 2 Experience,"just woke up late in the afternoon due to the exhaustion i had experienced and i just want to share this. let me preface this by saying i don’t mean to offend or disrespect the fliptop staff, emcees, and especially anygma with the some of the things that i’ll say in this long post. this is the 4th event that i have attended alongside with my partner, and we both have a great time whenever we go to their events. with that being said, ahon 13 - day 2 was memorable in the worst way possible for both of us. the way that the event should play out is that there 10 battles and the flow of the event should be like this: 3 battles -> short break -> 3 battles -> short break -> 2 battles -> short break -> 2 battles. note that the rap battles averaged around 30 mins. each. the last 2 battles are the match between sinio vs apekz that fans have been eagerly waiting for almost 5 years to happen, and the isabuhay 2022 finals between pistolero vs luxuria. specifically, the sinio vs apekz match is the single reason that most fans are attending this event. okay, so the first battle was between g-clown vs jr-zero (great battle btw). when the battle was about to start, electricity went out in the venue. may bumigay ata sa circuit breaker. anygma told us that to wait for about 40 mins to fix the situation. after waiting for about an hour, electricity came back and the first battle was able to start with no further issues. then the second battle started, which is the royal rumble match between sur henyo vs kregga vs batang rebelde vs lil strocks vs bagsik. this is when another problem of the venue has started to rise. the venue by the way is asuncion badminton court in san juan, manila. it has a narrow entryway which is not really a problem for a badminton court. around second battle ay napansin ko na dumami na mga tao sa venue, kahit yung entryway para sa gen ad at vip section ay mapupuno na pati na rin yung 2nd at 3rd floor. halos siksikan na kami sa vip section, at yung partner ko ay umalis na kasi di na raw siya makahinga dahil sa init, hindi siya ganun katangkad compared sa mga ibang tao sa section namin kaya mas ramdam niya ang init. sa case ko naman medyo di na kinaya yung init at nag-alala na sa partner ko ay di ko mabigyan ng full attention ang battle, kaya umalis na rin ako sa vip section at napansin ko na ang dami rin palang gustong umalis dahil sa init. nung nakalabas na ako sa vip section ay sinamahan ko na partner ko sa isang section ng venue na may hangin pa na pumapasok. after matapos yung 2nd battle ay nagkaruon ng mahabang break, may narinig na rin kami sa iba na may nahimatay na rin ibang tao sa crowd. natawa ako sa partner ko nung nag cr siya sa 3rd floor, sabi niya parang nasa bilibid siya dahil sa nakikita niya sa upper floors, mga lalaki nakahubad na mga shirts nila habang naka upo sa railings dahil sa sobrang init. almost 1 hr kami naghintay bago nag announce si anygma na dahil sa critical na sitwasyon namin sa venue ay uunahin na nila yung 3 main event level battles para mabawasan ang mga tao sa venue. the 3 battles are m zhayt vs cripli, pistoleto vs luxuria, and sinio vs apekz. nag stay parin kami ng partner ko sa same section na may hangin pa since rinig naman namin yung mga laban sa speakers. after nung 3 battles ay andami yung nagsi-alisan sa venue, halos 1/4 ng crowd na lang ang natira. around 2 am naka-alis na yung ibang tao sa venue ay kumain muna kami ng partner ko sa food stalls nila, this is also when i used the cr in the 2nd floor for the first time during the event. sabi ng partner ko walang flush yung cr nila sa 3rd floor, sa 2nd floor ganun din pero bruh, may natirang explosion pa sa inidoro tapos ang lawak ng brown puddle ay ma no-choice ka na tumapak dun para maka ihi ka lang. malala rin yung sa 3rd floor nung sinamahan ko partner ko, nasa labas ka palang pero ang tapang ng amoy. i-mention ko na rin na andaming basura sa venue, kulang yung designated trash bags sa venue. sa 2nd at 3rd floor naman wala kang makikita trash bags dun pero daming plastic bottles at beer cans sa tabi tabi. nung nag start na 6th battle between invictus vs fukuda, napansin ko na inaantok na partner ko sa pagod. decided kami na quits na sa event kahit sa gusto naming panuorin yung remaining battles pero halos 10 hrs na kami naka tayo dun sa venue eh hindi na talaga kinaya ng katawan namin ang pagod. tumambay muna kami sa mcdo na malapit sa venue para kumain ulit at maka-idlip saglit ang partner ko bago kami umuwi. so ayun, our fliptop ahon 13 – day 2 experience, aka san juan city jail experience. baka di lang talaga kaya katawan namin na magtagal sa mga ganung events. i feel bad lang sa mga iba na first time nila maka-attend ng fliptop event tapos ganito ang naranasan nila. hopefully anygma and fliptop staff will learn from this. thank you for having the time to read my long post. edit: i thought that half ng crowd ang nawala after the sinio vs apekz battle, but turns out halos 1/4 na lang ang natira upon seeing a pic of the whole venue comparing the crowd before and after their battle.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/zozzn0/my_fliptop_ahon_13_day_2_experience/,18 12 2022
"Why are apolo10s so brave online and ""passionate"" about supporting Jr. online but quickly deny about it when asked in person?","i visited some apolo10s in their workplaces (not sure why many of them ay nakapublic ang workplaces sa fb. isn't that info you normally keep private or visible only to friends?) to ask them face to face what they saw kay jr. and hopefully report their sharing of fake news and libelous statements to opposition candidates and their supporters to their human resources. based on my observations, i've noticed the following - 1. either todo deny sila they voted for bbm or sa mga posts nila (most of which involve fake news, paninira or bardagulan) kahit na i am showing it straight to their faces. i mean kakampinks are proud they voted for atty. leni, so are those who voted for yorme, pacquiao and the other candidates pero most of the apolo10s i meet and know deny jr. parang mga jeepney, taxi, tricycle and grab drivers along with middle-aged people lang ang proud to have voted him in person pero ung mga bata-bata (20's - 30's), todo deny. is it because they realize their mistake na or sadyang nakakahiya lang maging associated with the marcoses, even through the ballots? they've won, shouldn't more of them be proud of it? 2. common reason nila for their posts is nahack, identity theft, hiniram ng friend or relative ung account (do people seriously do this? di ba unsafe ung ganyan), lasing daw nun or sarcasm lang. 3. andaming apolo10s na service crew, blue collars and bpo agents. gets ko na malaki chance mauto ng mga service crew and blue collars due to the lack of decent education for most of them (no offense meant pero that's the stereotype) pero ano kaya nakikita ng mga bpo agents kay jr? same question goes to the highly-educated folks who voted for him. parang karamihan ng mga trolls work in a bpo or restaurant or food kiosk. di naman nila ako masagot kasi like i've said - many of them deny they ever supported or voted jr. 4. most trolls i've met, even those who are related to me and former friends, ay malalaki katawan - either obese or muscular (again, no offense meant, observation ko lang). 5. they consider it foul to report their posts sa employers nila yet before, during and after the elections - todo kalat sila ng fake news, libelous statements and even threats in some cases. as an hr practitioner kasi, if you made your employment public, everything you do or say might reflect sa company mo. i mean, would you really want to be served by someone na nagkakalat ng mga fake news and foul statements or if business owner ka, would you really want to be associated with internet trolls? my fellow kakampinks and even my supervisor, na isko supporter, is currently suggesting i stop doing this due to possible dangers and risks pero i plan to continue doing so - siguro irereport ko na lang sila sa employers nila online or daanan ko na lang pag merong apolo10 na nasa ruta ng fieldworks. nabalot kasi ako ng galit recently, enough for me to gain the strength to confront some of them directly. harap-harapan na kasi tayong ginagawang tanga ng philippine government pero sila todo depensa pa rin dito, kahit na karamihan sa kanila ay nararanasan ung mga shortcomings like our terrible transportation system and inflation and as an hr - pet peeve ko ang wrong choices pagdating sa tao who will be required to do a certain job.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/w2uetk/why_are_apolo10s_so_brave_online_and_passionate/,19 07 2022

Our daily dose of hopium: silent Leni supporters,"may event sa family kung saan may ilang hindi nakadalo. dahil dun sa mga absent na yon, nagkaroon ako ng opportunity makausap nang totohanan yung pinsan kong lalake kung sino talaga iboboto niya. before this, dalawang beses na ako nag-attempt na ikampanya si leni sa mga family members na madalas ko makainuman. both times, either tahimik lang si pinsan or pabiro ang mga sagot (like si rastaman daw iboboto niya). kanina nung kausap ko siya, pabulong niya inamin na ""silent"" daw siya. silent ano? silent bbm? nope. silent leni. ang pinsan kong to, gym rat. malaki ang katawan, yung tipong magdadalawang isip ka bago mo banggain. friendly din siya at magaling makipag-koneksyon. madami siya kaibigan na mga pulis. sabi rin niya, yung mga kaibigan niyang pulis na yon, leni supporters din. aminin ko guys, nabuhayan talaga ako ng loob. sabi niya kasi ayaw lang talaga niya mapaaway dahil sa choice niya, siguro dahil na rin ayaw niya makwestyon yung pride niya bilang maton na lalaki na boboto sa babae. pero aware siya sa mga kakulangan ni babym para magpatakbo ng bansa. binanggit pa nga niya yung smni debate na nagpasaring si clarita carlos dun sa mga hindi umattend ng debate nila. (please help me cite this kasi di ako nanood non.) parang nakalimutan nila na si marcos jr. ang numero unong duwag pagdating sa pakikipag-debate. one last thing na sagot ni insan nung sinabi ko na kaya tayo dapat nanghihikayat pa kasi yung survey gap ang hinahabol, mauulit daw ulit yung nangyari six years ago during the vice presidential election. i do think baseless yung confidence niya na ganun nga ang mangyayari kahit wala tayong ibang gawin, but the thought is at least heartening. p.s. kasama namin sa usapan yung isa ko pang pinsan na undecided daw pero lbm ang asawa. hopefully napaisip man lang namin siya kung hindi outright nakumbinsi mag-leni then and there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/tycnjb/our_daily_dose_of_hopium_silent_leni_supporters/,7 04 2022
Tagalized Story.,"may story ako. ako lang ang nag-iisang babae sa pinag-tatrabahuhan kong kumpanya at alam ko na kung bakit. isa akong fresh graduate sa kolehiyo at gusto ko na talagang makapag-simula ng career agad-agad na walang kinalaman sa pagse-serve ng pagkain, pagpupunas ng mga gamit, o pag-dadala o timpla ng kape sa isang matandang negosyante. sa naka-sanayan nag-aapply ako sa trabaho na may anim na araw na trabaho at marami-rami na rin akong interview na napagdaanan. alam ko na ang tinapos kong hrm na kurso ay hindi gaanong makaka-kuha ng magandang oportunidad, pero naniniwala pa rin ako na may mas maganda pang trabaho na naghihintay sa akin. kaya naman nanatili akong positibo, matyaga, at nag-aapply lang sa mga office jobs na may magandang benipisyo. kahit halos wala na akong mapag-kunan ng makakain dahil sa magastos na mga interview, at least mapapag-tibay naman nito ang kakaunting pride na natitira sa akin. halos tatlong linggo na rin ang nakalipas, may isa akong phone interview sa isang internet security company. ang kumpanyang iyon ay maraming offices sa amin at naghahanap sila ng bagong customer support specialist para sa kanilang international department. ang mga requirements ay maganda o mahinahon na boses, good spoken and written grammar, kakaunting tech-knowledge, at may kakayahang mag-trabaho sa umaga at gabi. ang office ay dalawang sakay lang sa mula sa amin, at mayroon silang magandang offer sa health insurance. nag-aapply ako kahit lmitado lang din ang alam ko sa computer science. naging maayos naman ang phone interview at matapos ang dalawang meetings sa hr at sa management, binigyan nila ako ng isang napaka-gandang offer (kahit na wala pa talaga akong experience sa kahit anong trabaho). sa loob ng unang linggo ko, kailangan kong magtrabaho nang regular shift na 9-5 (am) para maging online ako kasabay ng manager ko, na nag-trabaho sa ibang branch ng kumpanya. pagkatapos noon ay kailangan kong magtrabaho para sa regular na schedule ko bilang support - ang schedule ko ay 6 na araw na pasok (09:00 am -05:00 pm (am) at may isang araw na night shift 09:00 pm - 05:00 am respectively). sa unang araw ko, ang suot ko ay isang loose na sweater at mahabang skirt. bilang sa kaalaman ko ay sa ganitong uri ng trabaho ay karamihan mga lalaki ang empleyado, ayaw ko naman mag-cause ng unnecessary attention dahil sa provocatively o inappropriately pag-susuot ng hindi naayon na attire. ang lalaki sa front desk ay mukha namang maayos na tao. pinakilala n'ya ang sarili n'ya bilang si andrew bago n'ya ako tulungang mag-fill out ng mga paperwork at sinamahan n'ya na ako sa aking mesa at sa isang open space na workspace. nakatitig lang ako sa tila walang katapusang mga desks habang naglalakad kami, napansin ko na halos hindi mo makikita ang mga mukha ng bawat taong nagta-trabaho na naka-upo sa bawat desks. wala man lang akong nakita o napansin na babae habang nag-lalakad kami sa tila baga'y walang katapusang workspace na iyon, na talaga namang hindi normal at nakaka-bahala. kahit ang kalmadong presensya ni andrew ay hindi kayang maiwaglit ang wari kakaibang pakiramdam na naka-tuon sa akin. halos maubusan ako ng hininga ng maramdaman ko ang mga presensya ng bagong kong co-workers na tila nagsasabi na ""hindi ka nababagay dito"". nagulat ako ng biglang huminto si andrew sa isang desk na napuno ng mga printed memes, floral stickers, at isang lumang keychain na naka-patong sa harap ng monitor. bukod pa doon ay natatakpan na rin ng makapal na alikabok ang keyboard, monitor at ang natitirang ispasyo ng desk. ""ahhh... anong nangyari..."" sabi ni andrew sa medyo upset na boses. ""pasensya ka na."" sabi nito habang nakatingin sa aking mga papeles. ""ah... aya. dapat matagal na 'tong nalinis. kailangan kong maka-usap ang custodian"". ""ok lang 'yun"", sagot ko. ""puwede ko namang punasan na lang 'yan, wala namang problema"". medyo asiwa na noon si andrew, pero habang ginagala ko ang aking paningin ay malinaw na wala ng ibang bakanteng desk maliban doon. mabilis na natapos ang araw na iyon. natutunan ko na ang mga dapat kung gawin na sumagot sa support related phone calls at gumawa ng bagong ticket para sa system. kailangan ko ring i-monitor ang lahat ng pumapasok na chats at written tickets at isaayos ito base sa level ng urgency at type nito. hindi naman ako required mag-bigay ng technical advice, pero dapat maging pamilyar ako sa aming product software. bilang wala pa namang mga tawag ay pinaki-alaman ko muna ang manual. halos wala akong maintindihan sa mga naroon kaya naman ginogle ko na lang ang karamihan na nasa manual. kinumusta ako noon ng manager ko at mukhang hindi s'ya masaya sa mga lapses ko sa mga materials. dahil pakiramdam ko wala akong matinong nagawa at gagawin sa mga oras na iyon ay panandalian akong nag-break para linisin ang mesa ko. tumayo ako para tanungin si andrew kung saan makaka-kuha ng basahan para sa mesa ko. agad-agad kong pinagsisihan ang desisyon kong iyon. ang bawat mata sa kwarto ay tila napako sa pagtayo ko sa aking kinauupuan. hindi ako sigurado pero maraming mga bulungan akong narinig habang papalayo ako sa aking mesa. ang kaninang maingay na mga keyboard ay pahina nang pahina na halos kainin na ako ng lupa sa sobrang hindi ko pagiging kumportable at self-conscious na rin at the same time. napansin ko na lang na halos halikan ko na ang dibdib ko sa pagyuko para lang hindi ako mapansin. bago ako maka-rating sa isang palikong daan patungo sa front desk ay buong-lakas kong tinignan ang isang tila walang hiyang lalaki na nakatitig sa akin. hindi ko alam kung ano ang inaasahan ko, pero 'yung overall appearance ng lalaking naka-hooding pang-asar na 'yun ay nagbigay ng matinding kilabot sa buong katawan ko. siguro mga ka-edad ko s'ya pero hindi man lang s'ya nahiya o natinag sa pagkaka-titig n'ya sa akin sa kabila ng pagtitig ko sa kanya na may halong pagka-bwisit at inis. isang kakila-kilabot na ngiti ang sumilaw sa mga labi nito habang naka-titig sa parteng bukong-bukong ng aking mga paa at dahan-dahan itong bumalik sa kanyang monitor. inisip ko kung anong magiging reaksyon n'ya kapag tinitigan ko rin ng kaparehong paraan ng pagtitig n'ya sa akin ang tinitigyawat n'yang leeg. parehong reaksyon pa rin ang nakuha ko habang naglalakad ako pabalik sa aking mesa kasama ang box ng computer wipes sa mga kamay ko. may maganda ring nangyari sa araw na iyon. habang nililinis ko ang mga drawer ng mesa ko ay may nakita akong half-used notebook mula sa nakaraang nagta-trabaho sa mesa ko. hindi n'ya nilagay ang first name n'ya, kundi initial lang at last name: j. espiritu. pero, base sa dekorasyon ng notebook, sigurado ako na babae rin s'ya kagaya ko. ang mga naiwan n'yang gamit ay nagbigay ng kapanatagan sa akin, pero 'yung notebook ang talagang pumukaw ng atensyon ko. doon ay sinabi nito ang pina-ikli at simpleng manual gamit ang easy-to-undertand terms at mga explenasyon sa nakaka-litong terminolohiya at komplikadong panuto sa manual. sa tulong n'ya ay nasurpresa ko ang aking manager sa aking product knowledge pagkatapos ng shift ko. matapos ang isang magandang araw ay buong tapang akong gumala sa office at nag-explore sa pantry. binenta ni andrew sa akin ang top-notch coffee machine at snacks sa nasabing pantry, tutal nagugutom na rin naman ako matapos ang isang emotionally, intellectually and productive na araw na 'yun. (ansabe). tsaka, medyo butas na rin 'yung bulsa at namumula na ang mga credit cards ko, kaya naman ayos na ako sa ilang pirasong masasarap na cookies. habang papalapit ako ay may narinig akong malakas na usapan at tawanan sa pantry. sa katangahan ko ay inisip ko na baka naman mas mainit, friendly o kahit maka-tao na sila sa akin. subalit ang maliit na pantry ay napuno ng katahimikan the moment na pumasok ako sa pantry. may limang lalaki doon na mag-kakaiba ang edad at lalaki na naka-upo sa palibot ng isang maliit na lamesa, at lahat sila ay naka-titig na direkta sa akin. ""panget na araw?"" - tugon ng isang pang-asar na boses. agad kong itinaas ang ulo ko mula sa pagkaka-titig sa sahig para hanapin ang pinag-mulan ng boses. hindi naging mahirap sa aking hanapin at malaman na mula iyon sa naka-hoodie na walang-hiyang tumitig sa akin nung nakaraan lang. ""siguro marami ka ng experience?"" - sambit pa nito sa nakaka-asar na tono at may-unting pag-taas ng kilay. ""para makakuha ng komportableng trabaho. siguro sikat ka?"". ""ano 'to, high-school?"" - sagot ko sa malakas na boses. hindi ko hilig kumompronta ng tao, pero sobra na 'to. hostility is one thing, social awkwardness is another, pero pakiramdam ko isa 'tong 80's na high-school drama na mga trenta anyos ang mga bida bilang mga teenagers. ""nandito lang ako para kumuha kape at kung may problema ka sa trabaho ko, puwede mong dalhin sa hr kung ano man ang issue mo"". nagpatuloy ako habang ine-enjoy ang namumutla at pahiyang mukha ng mga taong 'yun. mabuti naman, gusto kong maramdaman nila ang katiting na discomfort na buong araw kung kinakaharap. pinili kong lumayo sa aking mga co-workers, naglakad ako ng taas noo pabalik sa mesa ko na may hawak-hawak na tasa ng kape. bago pa ako maka-upo at enjoyin ang masarap na kape, napansin kong may isang mensahe galing sa hindi kilalang number: ""you have quite an attitude, don't you?"" nanigas ako habang hawak ang cell phone sa isa kong kamay at kape sa kabila. habang prino-proseso ko ang tila breach sa personal security ko, naka-tanggap ulit ako ng dalawa pang mensahe. isa ay ang hubo't-hubad kong katawan na sinend ko sa una kong serious college boyfriend. ang pangalawa: ""bakit hindi mo ngayon ibigay 'yang picture sa hr?"" sa totoo lang, sobrang naapektuhan ako sa invasion ng privacy ko. pumasok ang kahihiyan sa akin at sobrang naiinis ako for drawing so much unwanted attention sa sarili ko. kasalanan ko lahat 'to. pumasok ako sa isang office na puno ng ethical hackers na may pare-parehong pangalan ng aso bilang password. walang duda na ang litratong iyon ay umiikot na sa buong office at lahat ng iyon ay salamat sa walang hiyang ka-trabaho ko, at isa na akong kakatuwang tao sa loob ng office. hindi ko na ginalaw ang kape ko at umuwi na lang, habang pinipigilan ko ang bawat emosyon na bumuhos hanggang makarating ako sa safety ng bahay. halos hindi ako matigil sa kaiiyak nung gabing 'yun, iniisip ko na ang mga mukha ng mga ka-trabaho ko habang tigang na tigang na nakatitig sa hubad kong katawan. mga alas tres na ng madaling araw, doon ko lang na-realize na wala ng kwenta para pa magpaka-lunod ako sa kahihiyan. kailangan kong gumawa ng plano para maka-survive sa ganitong uri ng workplace. quitting is not an option kasi masyadong malaki ang pasweldo nila para tumigil ako. tsaka, halos tinapay na lang ang kaya kong bilhin sa araw-araw. ang pangalawa kong option ay pumunta sa hr, but there's no way i was going to open that can of worms. hindi ko mapapatunayan kong sino talaga ang nag-send ng mga mensahe na iyon. last option? stick with it, keep my head down, gawin ang trabaho na pinasukan ko at 'wag pansinin ang iba pang mga harassment na gagawin nila. 'yun nga ang ginawa ko. sa kabuuan ng isang linggong training ko ay pumapasok ako on time, hindi ako umaalis sa desk ko liban na lang kung pupunta sa palikuran. iniwasan ko rin ang kahit anong contact kanino man at pinanatili ko lang ang aking mga mata sa mga inanimate objects. salamat kay j. espiritu, palagi akong on top ng training ko. sa bawat bagong task na galing sa manager ko, laging may katumbas na entry sa kanyang notebook. wala ng nakaka-gagong texts at face-to-face na kumprontasyon, pero mayroong kakatuwang pakiramdam na panibagong sisira sa kalagayan ko. sa darating na biyernes na ang huling training ko, na nagdala sa akin sa huling entry sa notebook. night shift survival guide: - matulog sa buong umaga bago ang shift at 'wag na 'wag kang matutulog. - walang sino man ang dapat maka-pasok. - panatilihing may pepper spray na dala. (sa kahit anong sitwasyon). - i-check ang bawat aisle, meeting rooms. huwag kalimutang i-check ang ilalim ng lamesa, balkonahe, kitchen tables at kahit likod ng cooler. - laging mag-open ng skype na naka-ready sa emergency in case na hindi gumana ang mobile services. - panatilihing updated sa kaibigan/pamilya/lover kada oras. ang nasabing listahan ay medyo may kahulugan. una, sabi ng hr puwede naman akong matulog sa pagitan ng 2-5 am, basta malapit palagi sa akin ang office smartphone. mayroon nga silang pull out couch sa isang conference room para lang talaga sa ganitong sitwasyon. pangalawa, ang buong shift ay phone calls, kaya palaging may paraan para maka-tawag mula sa office phone, tama? lastly, ang mga naka-outlined sa ""guide"" ay parang o.a at paranoid. siguro 'yung listahan ay satirical? (ewan ko). siguro si espiritu parehas kami ng pakiramdam tungkol sa mga tila patay gutom na mga asong cold-blooded na co-workers? pero 'yung isip ko nag-tatrabaho ng sobra-sobra para makita ang logic sa likod ng mga pag-iingat na ito. may kakatuwa akong pakiramdam na may importanteng impormasyon akong hindi nalalaman. lahat 'yun iniisip ko habang paalis ako ng bahay nung biyernes na 'yun, last day ng training ko. ""andrew"", - dahan-dahan akong lumapit sa kanya. ""puwede ba mag-tanong?"" ""sure thing"", - sagot n'ya na may maaliwalas na ngiti sa kanyang mga labi. ""nagtataka lang ako, bakit wala akong nakikitang ibang support agents. i mean, 'di ba dapat merong at least lima pang tao para ma-cover 'yung six-day rotation cycle?"" ""kailangan mong tanungin ang manager mo tungkol d'yan. most likely naka-kalat sila sa iba pang branch sa syudad. normal lang naman 'yun sa ganoong kaso"", - sagot n'ya. pakiramdam ko tapos na kami sa diskusyon na 'yun matapos s'yang bumalik sa final tasks n'ya para sa linggong iyon. ""meron bang ibang agent na nag-trabaho dito liban sa akin?"" - pagpapatuloy ko, dahil ganun na lamang ang kagustuhan kong malaman ang iba pang detalye sa babaeng nag-fill out ng notebook na s'ya namang ginagamit ko sa buong linggong iyon. ""oo, may isang babae na humawak sa posisyon mo ng panandalian"", - ani ni andrew, habang naka-titig pa rin sa screen ng kanyang screen. pero napansin kong tumigil na s'ya sa pag-tatype o pag-galaw ng mouse. wari ko ay naka-titig lang s'ya sa iisang spot sa monitor n'ya. ""andrew"", - nag-salubong ang mga kilay ko. ""sino 'yung nag-trabaho malapit sa main working space na talagang nakaka-inis? maputla, medyo payat, maitim at kulot na buhok?"" - tanong ko, habang nagpapaikot ng daliri sa bandang ulunan ko para i-describe ang pagkaka-kulot ng nasabing lalake. ""ah... si michael"", - sagot nito, napansin nito ang pagiging iritable ng boses ko. ""may problema ba? ginugulo ka ba n'ya?"" ""hindi"" - sagot ko, pero sa isip-isip ko ay nagtatalo na ang emosyon at sarili ko. ""have a good weekend, andrew"" ""ikaw din"", - sagot nito, halata na may pagtataka sa boses nito habang papaalis ako. sa buong weekend na 'yun ay binabalik-balikan ko ang mga nangyari sa akin sa unang linggo ko. pakiramdam ko may hindi sinasabi si andrew sa akin na importante. wala namang rason para maging iretable s'ya nung nabanggit ko 'yung babaeng nag-trabaho bago ako. may nag-reklamo na kaya kay michael dati? pu-puwede kayang si j. espiritu? si michael ba ang dahilan ng survival guide sa notebook? bakit s'ya umalis? napaka-daming teorya ang bumagabag sa buong weekend ko. bago ko pa nalaman, oras na para bumalik sa trabaho. ito ang araw na talagang sobrang daming trabaho. kahapon ay lunes, ang unang regular day shift. mabilis lang dumaan ang nasabing araw, habang aligaga ako sa pag-sagot ng tawag, recording, sorting at assigning ng dose-dosenang customer complaints sa system namin. hindi sapat ang salitang nasanay na ako at pagkatapos ng araw na 'yun ay sobrang pagod at ubos na ako. saktong maglo-logout na ako, naka-tanggap na naman ako ng mensahe mula sa hindi kilalang number. ""ang sipag mo naman. hindi na ako makapag-hintay na mag night shift ka"" seryoso?! ito ang kauna-unahang mensahe na bumalot sa buong pagkatao ko ng takot. agad-agad kong ginala ang paningin ko kung nasa paligid ba si michael para kumprontahin ko s'ya sa pagse-send ng mensahe, pero kanina pa pala s'ya umalis. matapos kong pakalmahin ang sarili ko, umuwi na ako at sinusubukan kong hanapin si j. espiritu online. ang pinaka best bet ko noon ay sa linkedin, at doon nga ay sinusubukan kong galugarin ang buong listahan ng mga babae na may kinalaman sa proficient technologies na naka-lagay sa profile nila (halos kakaunti lang talaga sila). nung wala akong makita ay pumunta ako kay andrew at doon nga sa friend list n'ya ay sa wakas nakita ko na ang hinahanap ko. may babae na pangalan ay jennah espiritu at unemployed ang status. nag-send ako ng friend request na may mensahe na nag-papakilala at tinanong ko s'ya kung hinarass ba s'ya ng isa n'yang ka-trabaho. sa wakas, pakiramdam ko may patutunguhan na ako, natulog ako at inihanda ang sarili para sa bukas na event. naisip ko na baka may kakaibang mangyayari dahil sa pagbabago ng schedule nung natulog ako ng miyerkules. nag-check ako ng linkedin halos pagka-gising ko mga ala una. walang kahit anong sign kay jennah, kaya naman natulog ulit ako para makapag-handa sa night shift. medyo kinakabahan ako at excited at the same time kasi puwede ko ng mas malibot ang buong place of work ko intimately. dahil walang day crowd, malaya akong makaka-gala at ma-eenjoy ang cookies, dumura sa baso ni michael, kahit ano! may mga iilan pa ring mga nag-tatrabaho nung dumating ako para sa shift ko, pero hindi ko naman iyon pinansin at dahil sa nag-uumapaw na mga tawag at chats na aasikasuhin. makalipas ang dalawang oras, ang bugso ng mga tawag at chats pati mga tickets ay unti-unting bumagal hanggang tuluyan na nga itong tumigil ng sabay-sabay halos alas onse na ng gabi noon. sumandal ako sa kinauupuan ko at ginala-gala ang mga paningin sa aking workspace. wala ng tao noon sa office at least sa nakikita ko. naka-bukas ang lahat ng ilaw pero nung tinanggal ko ang headphones ko, may narinig akong mahinang jingling melody sa hindi kalayuan. para s'yang christmas carol, pero hirap akong tukuyin kong saan ito nangga-galing. wala namang dahilan para matakot ako sa pangyayari, pero pakiramdam ko ang mga nagtayuang balahibo sa mga kamay ko ay nagsilbing alarm. nang tumayo ako sa aking kinauupuan, nawala 'yung melody. well, naging paranoid na ako dati. minsan ko ng inisip na na may lalaking sumusunod sa akin isang gabi hanggang nilagpasan n'ya ako at nagtungo sa kalapit na tindahan sa 'di kalayuan. kahit mag-isa lang ako, lagi kong dino-double at triple check ang mga lock ng bahay bago matulog. aaminin ko na ang mga takot ko ay wala naman talagang basehan. mayroong naka-iwan ng headphones na konektado pa rin sa computer nito at naka-on ang music. o siguro may office party sa ibang kumpanya sa baba ng building. ang makarinig ng kanta ay nakaka-takot lamang sa mga kakatuwang horror movies, 'di ba? 'di ba?! para maka-siguro, hinalughog ko ang office para maka-siguro na mag-isa na nga lang ako. habang naglalakad sa gitna ng mga magkaka-dikit na desks, naisip ko kung gaano ako ka-swerte na mayroon akong sariling corner spot. hindi ko siguro kakayanin na mapalapit sa kahit sinong mga hindi kaaya-aya kong mga co-workers. matapos ko ma-check ang bawat rows ay dumiretcho ako sa front desk area at nagmamasid sa mga kagamitan ni andrew sa paghahanap ng clues. nung wala akong makitang clues ay bumalik ako sa main room ng pantry. unti-unti ng mas nagiging relaxed ang mga senses ko at tsaka ko lang napag-tanto na napasarap ata ang taste-testing ko sa mga cookies sa halip na mag-hanap ng mga kahina-hinalang mga bagay. kailangan ko ng tumigil sa kaka-kain ng cookies, pero dahil bumalik na naman ang kaninang tunog na naririnig ko, mas malakas s'ya ngayon. at the same time, ang work smartphone ko (na kinakailangan dala-dala namin kung aalis kami sa aming work station) tumunog at may mensahe mula sa hindi na namang kilalang number. so, nag-eenjoy ka ba sa cookies, ha? nanigas ang buong katawan ko habang prino-proseso ng utak ko ang mga pangyayari. siguro hindi talaga umalis ng office si michael at ngayon tinatakot ako. kinalikot ko ang tenga ko noon at nakinig ng maigi. walang kahit sino sa pantry as least sa nakikita at naririnig ko. tsaka, kung si michael ay nasa main workspace, hindi naman ganun kahirap na hulaan o sabihin na kumakain ako ng cookies. habang dahan-dahan akong humihinga, hindi ko muna pinansin ang tunog at nakinig ako ng maigi kung may iba pa akong tunog na maririnig. wala. dahan-dahan, naglakad ako sa may pantry drawers at doon may nakita akong malaking kutsilyo. alam ko bang gumamit ng kutsilyo? hindi. kaya ko kayang paalisin kung sino man ang unarmed na kalaban? syempre. papunta na sana ako pabalik sa aking work station ng biglang may tawag na pumasok mula sa work phone. ipinosisyon ko ang sarili ko ng kumportable sa pader ng pantry, kutsilyo sa kanang kamay, cell phone sa kabila, bago pa ako maka-sagot with the standard customer support greeting. nag static na sa kabilang linya at iba pang ingay sunod ang tuluyang pagka-putol ng linya at katahimikan. nung tinignan ko ang cell phone, nakita kong naka-patay na ito. sinubukan kong buksan ulit ito, pero hindi na ito gumagana. ok, ngayon kailangan ko ng bumalik sa computer ko in case na may pumasok pang mga tawag. naalala ko bigla ang isa sa mga guide na galing kay jennah habang isinusuksok ko ang walang kwentang cell phone sa bulsa ko. - laging mag-open ng skype na naka-ready sa emergency in case na hindi gumana ang mobile services. nangyari rin kaya 'to sa kanya? ang mga instructions sa notebook ay unti-unti ng nagkaroon ng kahulugan, at minumura ko ang sarili ko dahil sa pagiging tanga. sa oras na lumabas ang mga salita sa bibig ko ay may isa na namang mensahe ang dumating sa cell phone. kinuha ko iyon at sinubukang i-unlock, pero 'yung regular home screen ay hindi lumalabas. ang lumabas lang ay isang white screen na may maikling text. putang ina. ang mga babae dapat hindi ginagamit ng ganung mga uri ng salita. matapos kong mabasa 'yun ay nawala na ito sa screen at may panibagong text ang lumabas. bakit hindi ka lumabas at makipag-laro? huwag mo ng isiping bitbitin pa 'yang kutsilyong hawak mo. wala ring magagawa 'yan sa hawak kong baril. tinapon ko ang cell phone ko sa lapag at agad-agad ay nagtungo ako sa aking computer. ang tunog ay mas lalong lumakas habang papalapit ako sa aking lamesa, doon ay nakita kong may isang baboy na stuffed toy. may fabric button ito sa bandang paanan at music note na kasama. dito nagmumula ang tunog at nagpapatunay lamang na hindi ako mag-isa at may kung sino akong kasama. ang malala pa, pinapanood nila ang bawat galaw ko at sinusubukang takutin gamit ang mga laruang pambata. unti-unti ng dumadaloy ang pagpapanic sa aking buong katawan at naghahanda na sa fight or flight scenario. huminga ako ng malalim, sinusubukan kong pakalmahin ang buong katawan ko. so far wala pa naman akong naririnig ng kahit anong palatandaan na may ibang tao sa loob ng office. may mga background noises galing sa syudad sa labas at ang mga ingay mula sa naka-limutang patayin na computer ng isang employee. kung sino man ang gumagawa nito sa akin, kailangan kong malaman ang kanilang eksaktong lokasyon para maplano ko ng maayos ang pag-takas ko. isa pa, kailangan kong maka-kuha ng tulong sa lalong mas madaling panahon. habang iginigilid ko ang laruan ay umupo na ako sa aking upuan at pinull-up ang skype for business application. mabilis akong nag-dial ng 911, habang naka-loudspeaker ang telepono. tumunog na nga ang dial tone at agad-agad ay may live operator na sa kabilang linya. ibibigay ko na sana ang mga hindi kanais-nais na pangyayari sa akin ng mga oras na iyon ng may biglang humawak sa bukong-bukong ko mula sa ilalim ng lamesa. halos maubos ang buong lakas ko sa pagsigaw habang nagpu-pumiglas ang mga paa at mabilis na tumakbo sa abot ng aking makakaya sa bilis na hindi ko akaling kaya ko. may narinig akong kung anong kumusyon sa aking likuran habang tumakbo, kasunod ng isang malakas ng putok, na inisip ko na lamang na galing sa kung ano o sino man ang humahabol sa akin. bago ko pa malaman ay halos nasa ground floor na ako papunta sa pinto lagpas sa gwardiya na halatang nagulat sa mga nangyayari. ang malamig na hangin ay mabilis na pumasok sa manipis kong sweater habang papalapit ako sa isang malapit na pedestrian para humingi ng tulong. tumawag sila ng 911 at ang mga pulis ay agad namang dumating wala pang sampung minuto. habang naghihintay ako kasama ang gwardiya para sa kanilang pag-dating, hindi maalis sa isip ko ang sinulat ni jennah na warning, at kung gaano ako ka-tanga para ipagsa walang bahala ang mga ito. - i-check ang ang bawat aisle, meeting room. huwag kalimutang i-check ang ilalim ng lamesa, balkonahe, kitchen tables at kahit likod ng cooler. agad-agad namang sinulat ng pulis ang mga nangyari sa akin at iniwan ako kasama ang isang pulis officer, umakyat s'ya para i-check ang office. wala namang naka-labas-masok sa building mula nung tumakbo ako palabas, kaya malaki ang posibilidad na naroroon pa rin ang salarin at nagtatago sa loob. sa pag-iisip ay halos bumaliktad ang buong sikmura ko at mas lalo akong lumapit sa may armas kong kasama. maya-maya pa matapos kaming iwanan ng mga pulis, ang kasama kong pulis ay nag-radyo at isa-isa may mga boses na nagpapa-palit-palit sa radyo na humingi ng backup at nga mga codes na hindi ko maintindihan. mabilis na nag-escalate ang mga sumunod na pangyayari. imbis na pauwi ay dinala nila ako sa police station at doon ay nanatili ako sa isang interrogation room ng halos 2 oras bago pa sa wakas may dalawang pulis officer ang kumausap sa akin. pagod na ako noon, miserable ang kalagayan at higit sa lahat litong-lito sa kung papaano naganap ang mga pangyayari. gusto ko ng umuwi pero nanatili pa ako ng ilang oras para i-kuwento ang mga pangyayari sa dalawang pulis officer. 'ahh... meron kang kutsilyong hawak habang tumakbo ka galing sa pantry papunta sa lamesa mo? sigurado ka ba?' tanong ng isang nakaka-tandang officer na nagpakilala bilang senior investigator manlapig. 'ah. ah... oo.' pautal-utal kong sagot sa kanya. 'naniniwala akong meron. nag-papanic na ako noon, kaya mahirap sabihin. tapos may baboy na stuffed toy, ' sabi ko, habang tila baga'y nawawalan ako ng abilidad na mag-isip ng tama. 'at naniniwala ka na ang taong humaharass sa'yo ay si michael villareal?' sabi ng isa pang officer, hindi ko maalala 'yung pangalan n'ya. wala s'yang badge. 'hindi ko alam buong pangalan n'ya, pero wala na akong ibang kilala na iba pang responsable.' 'at sa huling pagkakataon, just for the record, anong nangyari matapos mong mag-dial ng 911?' tanong ni manlapig sa ika-apat na pagkakataon sa gabing 'yun. 'may kung sino ang humawak sa binti ko. bukong-bukong, actually. nangyari 'yun bago pa ako magkaroon ng pagkakataong ipaliwanag ang sitwasyon sa operator. nagsusumigaw at piglas ang mga paa ko tapos tumakbo hanggang may makita akong tao sa labas na pina-tawag ako sa 911 para sa tulong.' sagot ko, habang pagod na pagod sa paulit-ulit at paikot-ikot na pagtatanong. 'si michael villareal ay natagpuang patay sa hindi kalayuan ng iyong lamesa nung pumunta ang officer namin sa pinang-yarihan ng insidente. nakita mo ba ang kanyang katawan nung tumakbo ka palabas ng office?' tanong ng isang officer. halos malaglag ang panga ko sa mga narinig ko at tumitig sa dalawang pulis habang balisa at nanginginig sa takot. 'hi.. hi.. hindi,' pabulong akong nag-salita, 'hindi ko maintindihan,' 'sinaksak s'ya hanggang sa mamatay gamit ang malaking kutsilyo. ang katawan n'ya ay balot ng dalawampu't-tatlong saksak,' paliwanag ni manlapig. 'at nakita namin ang kutsilyo ay nakabaon sa bibig nito, dahilan para dumikit ito sa sahig diretcho sa lalamunan,' 'may rason kami para pagsuspetyahan na ito rin ang sinasabi mong kutsilyo,' dagdag pa ng pangalawang officer. nakatitig ako sa dalawang pulis officer ng tahimik, hirap akong intindihin ang mga pangyayari lalo na't ang utak ko ay halos mawala na sa ulirat. 'ang mga sinabi mo ay nagpapatunay lamang sa mga natagpuaan namin sa cell phone ni michael villareal. nalaman namin na may roon siyang hacking apps,' pagpapatuloy ng senior officer. 'natagpuan din naman ang ilan mo pang mga hubong larawan at ang mga mensahe na iyong nabanggit. mayroon s'yang baril at nakita rin naman ang basyo ng bala nung binaril ka n'ya habang papatakas ka.' 'ang hindi namin maintindihan ay kung papaano s'ya namatay.' dagdag pa ng pangalawang officer, halatang hindi s'ya naniniwala sa aking reaksyon. 'ok lang kung napatay mo s'ya dahil sa self-defense, aya. may balak s'yang masama sa'yo.' 'hindi,' pautal-utal kong sagot. 'pangako, wala akong ideya... oh, oh my god.' naiyak na ako dahil sa mga nangyayari. 'ibig kong sabihin, nung nakaraang buwan lang may nag-report sa kanya galing sa isa n'yang co-worker,' sabi ni manlapig. 'jennah,' bulong ko. 'kilala mo si miss espiritu?' tanong ng pangalawang officer, at ng suspetya sa kanyang mga mats. 'hindi,' ako ang pumalit sa lamesa n'ya at nakuha ko ang notebook n'ya. dapat sinabi ko na 'to kanina pa. anong sabi sa report? doon nga ay nagtitigan ang dalawang pulis at maka-lipas ang ilang sandali ay inilatag at ipinaliwanag ni manlapig ang mga hindi magandang nangyari kay jennah na halos mangyari na sa akin. si jennah espiritu ay dumiretcho sa pinaka-malapit na hospital mula sa kanyang unang night shift tatlong buwan na ang nakakaraan. sobrang bugbog ng katawan n'ya at sugatan, at gustong mag-file ng anonymous rape kit. ang natanong damage n'ya sa kanyang puwerta ay sobrang severe na kinailangan n'yang sumailalim sa operasyon at magpatahi. nag-file s'ya ng police report makalipas ang dalawang buwan matapos s'yang hindi pumasa sa probationary period sa inyong kumpanya, ng nawala s'ya sa trabaho (ang nagiisang paraan para mabayaran ang kanyang utang sa hospital). ang nangyari ay ang kanyang aligasyon kontra kay michael villareal, na gumastos s'ya ng malaki sama mo pa ang hindi mabilang na kanyang mga co-workers na kumontra sa kanya laban sa magalang at kaaya-ayang katangian ni michael. 'pero kahapon lang ay iniurong na n'ya lahat ng mga isinampa n'yang kaso kay michael,' sabi ng walang badge na pulis. 'kasalukuyan naming inaalam ang kinaroroonan ni espiritu para ma-interview namin s'ya. sigurado ako na ngayon malinaw na kung bakit may suspetya kami sa iyo bilang nakikilala mo espiritu.' nagpatuloy ang mga tanong ng dalawang pulis hanggang may isang lalaki na nag-abot sa kanya ng isang sobre. natukoy na ng forensics ang fingerprint na nakita sa kutsilyo at ang blood-spatter patterns. kinailangan ko ring mag-submit ng dna samples para maka-tulong sa imbestigasyon at sa wakas ay pina-uwi na nila ako. sa bahay, dahil sa sobrang pagod, hindi ako maka-tulog. wala akong gamit na naiuwi. bag, cell phone at kahit ang jacket ko ay kinailangan i-submit bilang ebidensya. kaya naman napilitan akong gamitin ang luma kong laptop, umaasa na malibang sa internet. ang browser ko ay naka-login pa rin sa linkedin account ko mula sa nakaraang login, at nirefreshed ko ang page bilang naka-sanayan. isang maliit na red icon ang lumitaw na mayroon akong bagong mensahe. jennah. nagre-reply na s'ya sa akin. don't worry, sis. i took care of it. ❤️",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/t77k69/tagalized_story/,5 03 2022

Bilang tugon sa issue na bumabalot sa trans women, ito ay isang maikling informative post tungkol sa SOGIE, partikular na sa Gender Identity para ipaintindi at mabawasan ang kalituhan ukol dito.","primer image: https://flyingketchup.ph/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/sogie3-576x1024.jpg alam niyo ba na lahat ng tao may sogie? ano nga ba ang sogie? acronym ito na ang ibig sabihin ay... s - sex: as in biological, base sa ari nang ipinanganak tayo (female, male, intersex). akma rin ang paggamit ng assigned gender at birth (agab) dito: (assigned female at birth/afab, assigned male at birth/amab) o - orientation: base sa romantic at/o sexual attraction natin (straight, gay, lesbian, etc. / heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, pansexual, asexual, etc.) gi - gender identity: base sa pansariling pagkakakilanlan ayon sa kasarian o gender self-identity - cisgender - magkatugma ang agab sa gender identity (cisgender male: agab identifying as a man; afab identifying as a woman - gender fluid - nagiiba depende sa panahon, puwedeng tumutugma, puwedeng hindi tumutugma - transgender - hindi magkatugma ang agab sa gender identity (trans woman: amab identifying as a woman, afab identifying as a man, af/mab identifying as non-binary*] *non-binary - puwedeng halong man at woman, puwedeng wala e - expression: panlabas na pagpapakita (masculine, feminine, or androgynous [sa gitna]) ang sogie, puwedeng halo-halo - puwede kang maging cisgender straight male presenting as feminine, puwedeng maging gay transman presenting as androgynous/feminine. oo, medyo mahirap intindihin minsan, pero ang pag-parse layunin nang paghiwalay ng s, o, gi, at sa e ay upang tulungang intindihin ang mga tao na hindi tumutugma sa typical o tradisyunal na kaalaman - upang intindihin ang kanilang sarili o ang ibang tao. besides, mas bihira ang magkakahalong sogie, pero kung may ma-encounter tayo na halo-halo, maskaya nating intindihin kung matandaan mo ang sogie. madalas nating naririnig o mababasa na hindi totoong babae ang transwoman, masbihira ang panawagan na hindi totoong lalake ang transman. bakit? sa aking kaalaman, hindi magkahiwalay ang sex at gender identity sa ating mga wika. sa tagalog, pasok sa salitang ""kasarian"" ang sex at gender. kaya maiintindihan din natin kung bakit may ganitong kalituhan. pero, hindi naman natin ipagkakaila na malakas ang impluwensya ng mga banyaga sa kulturang pilipino. ginamit ko as example ang wikang tagalog, pero sa filipino, pasok ang salitang gender sa wikang ito. malakas ang impluwensya ng mga banyaga sa atin, wag natin ito ipagkaila - parte na ito ng kulturang pilipino. pero, may sariling atin din tayo tulad ng bakla na puwedeng tumukoy sa homosexual at/o transwoman - may sarili tayong mga salita at kultura na tumutukoy sa sogie na iba sa banyaga. hindi ito black or white na dapat pumili tayo sa banyaga o sa lokal na pagkakaintindi, puwedeng gumawa ng hybrid na pagkakaintindi dito. useful naman ang sogie framework, parte na rin naman ang kulturang bakla sa kulturang pilipino. puwede natin palaganapin ang consciousness ukol sa gender kapag magawan ng paraan para magamit ang mga ito. **ano ang issue sa gender identity?** balikan natin ang issue sa transman/woman. ang sinasabi ng iba, hindi babae ang transwoman. iklaro natin na hindi female ang transwoman, oo, never silang magiging female - a male cannot be female. but a male can identify as woman. paano? pagtuunan natin ng pansin ang ""identity"". mag-imagine tayo ng baller o mahilig sa basketball, may mabubuo tayong mga imahe na hindi magkakalayo sa isa't-isa. mag-imagine tayo ng skater, ng coffee lover, ng artist, ng rocker, ng car enthusiast, ng kung anu-ano pa. may nabubuo rin tayong imahe ng kanilang lifestyle na tumutukoy sa kanilang pananamit, mga gawain, kilos, atbp. sa baller, mai-imagine natin na naglalaro at mahilig silang manuod ng basketball - up to date sa mga events ng nba at kung ano pa. may iba-iba tayong imahe ng mga identity na ito, pero valid lahat ng interpretation natin sa mga ito. wala namang may authority para sabihin hindi ka ganito. isipin natin si pacquiao, ano ang imahe natin sa kaniya? boxer, pulitiko (????). pero diba mahilig rin siya mag basketball? pero nang subukan niya maglaro, pinagtatawanan siya ng mga tao. ""hindi ka basketbolista!"" ""sa boxing ka na lang!"". ""hindi ka bagay sa basketball"" isa pa, extreme example naman. isang tao na pinanganak na may congenital issue kaya physically hindi siya puwede mag-skate. pero gustong-gusto niya maging skater. nagdadamit siya na akma sa pagkakaintindi niya ng skater at sumusunod sa mga balita at tumatambay siya sa mga nags-skate. matatawag ba natin siyang skater kahit na hindi niya kaya mag-skate? kung may mahirap na mahilig sa kape, dinalaw ng kaibigan na mahilig rin sa kape. nadismaya nang nakita na percolator ""lang"" ang gamit niya. ""pano mo nasabing enthusiast ka kung ganiyan lang kape mo?"". ang tawag dito, gatekeeping: may standards ang mga tao na sila rin lang ang may gawa at kung hindi ka pasok dito, out ka - isang poser o nagco-cosplay lang. ""pero iba ang gender, nakabase yan sa sex"" nakabase ang masculinity at femininity sa gender identity. ano ang masculinity at femininity? ito ay mga traits na kadalasan naa-assign sa kalalakihan o kababaihan. kung nakabase ito sa biology, dapat exclusive ang mga traits na ito sa male at female lang. kung ang lalake ay emotional, nababawasan ba ang pagiging male niya, o ang nakikitang pagkalalaki niya? kung matapang ang babae, less female ba sila, o nagpapakita sila ng masculine traits? being male/female is not about masculinity/femininity, but being a man or a woman is related to masculinity/femininity. paano ang mga masculine women at feminine men? kung gumagamit ka ng gamer mouse, keyboard, chair, at computer, at naglalaro ka ng video games, choice mo parin kung tatawagin mo sarili mo na gamer o hinde. puwede kang mag bike para pumasok nang hindi tinatawag ang sarili mo na cyclist, puwede kang maging masculine at mag-identify as a woman. walang nagmamay-ari ng mga traits na ito, kahit sa masculinity o femininity, madalas lang nakakabit sa male at female ang mga ito. tulad ng mga example sa taas, valid ang bawat isang pansariling interpretation kung ano ang masculine at ano ang feminine. iba-iba ang experience ng bawat isang tao ukol dito. sa tahanan (nanay/tatay), sa mga kapitbahay, sa socioeconomic status (e.g. fashion, activities na panlalake/pambabae) - valid lahat ng interpretation natin diyan. ikumpara natin sa ethic groups at race. bakit masama na magsuot ng damit ng iba o tanggalin sa konteksto ang mga tradisyon nila? kasi ito ay heritage nila, kultura na nakakabit sa kanilang mga grupo na may kaakibat na meaning. walang ganito ang masculinity at femininity. tulad ng halimbawa na disabled skater at low-income coffee lover, sino ba tayo para harangin sila sa pagkakakilala nila sa kanilang sarili? *hindi pinili ng mga trans people na malagay sila sa katawan na hindi akma sa gender identity nila, sana intindihin natin ang dinaranas nila dahil dito.* edit: isipin din natin na ang masculinity/feminity ay automatic nang ia-assign ayon lang sa sex simula pa lang ng pagkabata. hindi nabibigyan ng tsansa ang tao na pumili ng kanilang gender identity hanggang sa magkamalay tayo. parte ito ng pagiging tao, oo, pero magandang isipin sa pinagdadaanan ng mga trans. **bakit tinatawag na transphobe sa mga taong sumasalungat sa opinyon na ito?** ang pagiging trans ng tao ay nakabase sa gender identity niya, kapag sinabi natin na hindi sila ""real man/woman"", dinedeny natin ang gender identity nila. ang personal take ko diyan, transphobe ka if you are informed and justify this denial. maiintindihan naman natin kung nalilito ang tao tungkol dito. pero yung ibang mga tao, simula pa lang nang malaman nila ang gender identity nila, madami nang takot at anxiety na naramdaman kaya naiintindihan ko rin ang galit nila. sigurado ako na maraming butas sa explanation ko na to kasi minamadali ko lang talaga haha. sana mabigyan ko ng sagot yung mga tanong dito. let's be civil please. give everyone the benefit of the doubt :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/11gp69m/happy_womens_month_bilang_tugon_sa_issue_na/,3 03 2023

Got into a motor accident due to bad road condition,"hi guys! gusto ko sana magtanong ng payo if i can be compensated and/or file for damages for the accident that happened to me last night. **context** nagmomotor kami ng kapatid ko. sa may outer lane kami dumaan dahil malalaki yung mga truck sa may middle lanes. newly asphated yung road. kapag nag aasphalt ng road, tumataas yung elevation ng new road. pero may old drainage na di naisabay sa pag taas ng road elevation, so naging pot hole sya. gabi na during our ride tapos hindi well lit ang road. wala ring nailagay na cover or metal grating para mapantay ang level ng drainage dun sa bagong level ng road. wala ring any warning or signage to inform the motorists na may pot hole doon. **damages** so nagtamo kami ng lots of abrasions sa katawan namin. heavily damaged din yung motor namin. di pa ako makalakad ngayon. yung kapatid ko was put into a near death situation dahil malapit sya masagasaan ng truck nung tumilapon sya. still thankful that we're now safe and alive. btw kahapon after the incident nagpa hospital kami, nag xray at initial findings is wala namang serious injuries. nagkausap na rin kami ng police patrol kahapon na gagawan namin ng police report tomorrow. **question** may i ask if ano ba process ng pag file ng complaint? kasi i think at fault either ang dpwh or ang contractor ng project for failing to implement sufficient safety measures dun sa pot hole. may i also ask if ano pa ang mga damages na pwede ko irequest aside from the direct cost ng medical and motor damages, and how to possibly substantiate them? thank you for reading! tldr; got into a motor accident due to a pot hole in the road na walang any safety warnings/ signage. how to process complaint and/ or file for damages? edit: added context",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/qt4udl/got_into_a_motor_accident_due_to_bad_road/,13 11 2021
Falling inlove pero mahirap ako.,"&#x200b; hi literally new this subreddit, eto po background, di po ako totally mahirap yung family namin yung may kaya lang, buong buhay ko iniisip ko na dapat di ako mag mahal dahil i'm already used to living a frugal life like alam mo yung wala ka pera kasi wala naman stable income ang mother ko, and personal reasons insecure ako about sa financial status ko. now na bago ako sa college, new environment and tumagal na din ang panahon i now love my self na pero there's still that insecurity about my financial status, now there's this girl that i'm really interested on, first time ko lang talaga mag ka-crush ng ganito kasi dati nga diba mababa tingin ko sa sarili ko so i never really bothered. frugal, family oriented ako, idealistic ako sa relationships talaga ako. note: this girl is from cavite and i'm from manila things happened with this girl and we're talking daily na and may plano kami sa december mag pass ng documents and i invited her to go out after that, ang problema lang ay pano makipag date ng mababa lang budget? originally we were supposed to go to fine arts museum, pero nakapunta na kami dun with out classmates now napag usapan namin na gusto namin sa ayala museum eh may entrance fee dun and talk about transportation and food, natatakot na ko pano ko ibubudget or how can i get the funds, now i'm finding places sa manila na magugutuhan namin dalawa. we don't like yung arcade or something na magastos talaga, gusto namin art museums, kanina pinaalala ako ni mama na ""mag jojowa ka wala naman pera"" and napaiisip nanaman ako na ""tama ba na ma fall inlove ako kahit walang pera?"" bumabalik nanaman yung stigma sa katawan ko na bawal ako mag mahal dahil sa financial situation ko, and baka ma turn off si girl na wala akong pera? feeling ko naman hindi siya ganun pero there's still that lingering feeling. i want to experience new things, i want to fall in love pero pwede ba talaga yan if mahirap ka lang? most of my friends may kaya sa buhay and ako lang talaga yung walang pera, mahirap etc, etc... i don't know why tbh kung bakit pumayag si girl yung inask out ko siya pero i'm happy that i'm experiencing new things in my life! like super ganda niya, siya pinakang maganda sa buong class namin and her personality is just so charming to me, and there's me the not so attractive guy. and feeling ko may kaya din si girl and her family.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/yyyxr3/falling_inlove_pero_mahirap_ako/,19 11 2022
Kaibigan,"""sab..."" nanginig ako nang marinig ang boses ng aking matalik na kaibigan sa kabilang linya. lately, pakiramdam ko ang layo layo niya sakin. hindi ko siya maramdaman, hindi siya yung babaeng nakikita kong masigla, masiyahin at walang takot harapin ang kanyang problema. ""kate, nasaan ka?"" kalmado kong tanong sa kanya. abot abot ang kabang nararamdaman ko. natatakot sa posibleng mangyari. lakad takbo ang aking ginagawa papunta sa kanila. ""ayoko na"" walang ganang sagot ni kate. ""pagod na ako, sab."" walang buhay niyang sagot. ""kate, please stay with me. wag mo ibababa ang tawag. malapit na ako ha?"" suyo ko sa kanya. rinig ko ang malalim niyang paghinga sa kabilang linya. ramdam ko ang kanyang lungkot, tumatagos ito sa aking pagkatao, nag-usal ako ng panalangin sa aking isipan at tumakbo na sa kanilang bahay. apat na bahay na lang lalagpasan ko at malapit na ako. ""sorry, sab."" may narinig akong pagbagsak ng isang bigay kasunod ng pagputol ng tawag. nanlalamig ang aking katawan, kahit sa nanlalabong mga paningin dahil sa mga luhang humaharang rito ay mabilis akong pumunta sa kanilang bahay. ""tita! tito!"" sigaw ko nang makaabot ako sa kanilang pinto, maya maya pa ay binuksan ng kuya ni kate ito. ""uy sab, miss me?"" tanong ni matt ng pabiro pero tinulak ko siya at bago man ako makaakyat ay natanaw ko pa ang ibang masasayang miyembro ng pamilya ni kate. lingid sa mga ngiti ng bawat isa meron na pala isa sa kanilang nagdurusa. ""sab! bat ka nagmamadali?"" sigaw ni matt sa ibaba ng hagdan at napamura ako rito saka sumigaw ""p\*tangina tumawag kayo ng ambulansya!!"" nakalock ang kwarto ni kate kaya kinalampag ko ito ng kinalampag, nagsiakyatan na rin ang magulang ni kate at sinimula nilang tawagin ito hanggang sa tuluyan ng sinira ni tito ang kanyang pintuan. ""kate! kate!"" sigaw ko rito at nagtungo sa kanyang banyo at naabutan namin si kate na nakahandusay sa sahig at napapalibutan na siya ng dugo. ""kate, andito na ako. shh"" haplos ko sa kanyang pisngi at humalik sa kanyang ulo. binuhat siya ni tito, umiiyak ang kanilang bunsong kapatid, ang kanyang ina nama'y natataranta at si matt ay nakatulala lamang sa aming nadatnan takot na takot man ako pero nagpakatatag ako para sa bestfriend ko. si kate, isa siyang masayahing babae, matataas na grado ang nakukuha sa eskwelahan, kinagigiliwan ng lahat, madaling maging kaibigan pero siya rin yung babaeng magaling magtago ng tunay na nararamdaman, nakangiti kahit nahihirapan. napahikbi ako ng isakay na nila si kate sa ambulansya at sumunod rito sina tita at tito, naiwan ako sa kanilang bahay kasama si matt at ang bunso nilang kapatid na limang taong gulang. binuhat ko si sarah at inalo ito. ""shh, magiging okay din ang ate kate mo. magiging okay din ang lahat."" hinaplos ko ang buhok nito at tumingin kay matt na tulala pa rin hanggang sa ngayon, nahawakan niya rin ang kanyang kapatid kung kaya't may mga dugo ang kanyang mga kamay. ""all this time, akala ko kilala ko yung kapatid ko. akala ko nagpakakuya ako sa kanya, akala ko wala siyang problema, akala ko open kami sa isa't isa"" tulala niyang sambit. ramdam ko ang sakit sa tono ni matt, maski ako akala ko nagawa ko na lahat ""this will be the lesson para sa ating lahat. no matter how happy they look, no matter how healthy they are. there's a possibility that loneliness can kill us."" napahinga ako ng malalim. ""kate wants to kill that feeling pero hindi yung mismong siya. kate is a fighter, matt. napagod lang siya pero sana sa panibagong pagkakataon na meron siya ay sana andito na tayo to help her and support her with her own battle."" mangiyak ngiyak kong sambit nang maramdaman ko na niyakap ako ni matt habang buhat buhat ko si sarah.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/10e5v8v/kaibigan/,17 01 2023

Midnight Memories.,"alas dose 'y media nang hating-gabi na iyon at papasok na ako sa trabaho. *sa fx* isang magandang babae ang sumakay at naupo sa tabi ko. mabango at kahit medyo madilim sa loob ng fx ay litaw ang ganda n'ya. maya-maya pa ay medyo napa-sandal na s'ya sa balikat ko. - babae: ""ayy.. sorry."" *hinawi ang buhok pataas at nahikab*. ako: *ngumiti at tumango bilang pag-tanggap sa sorry nito*. ilang minuto pa ang nag-daan ay naramdaman kong napapa-sandal na naman s'ya sa balikat ko. napa-tingin ako sa balikat ko at tiniti-tigan ko o ina-abangan kung matu-tuluyan bang mahihiga s'ya sa balikat ko. hindi ko alam kung anong tuwa ang nararamdaman ko noong mga panahon na iyon, pero ang alam ko, masaya ako sa mga nangyayari. maya-maya pa nga ay tuluyan nang nahiga sa balikat ko ang babae kaya naman hinayaan ko na lamang. lumipas pa ang halos tatlumpong-minuto at papalapit na ako sa aking bababaan, pero hindi pa rin nagigising ang babae. kaya naman... - ako: ""madame? miss?"" babae: *medyo nagulat at parang naalimpungatan*. ako: *naka-ngiti* ""sorry. pero, kasi bababa na ako e."" babae: *nag sink-in na ata 'yung nangyari* ""ayyy... hala!! sorry kuya."" *napa-facepalm at hinagod ang buhok pataas* ""sorry talaga kuya."" ako: *ngumiti lang at tumango*. maya-maya pa nga ay pumara na ako at akmang tatayo nang napansin ko na kumikilos na rin ang babae na para bang bababa na rin. hindi nga ako nag-kamali. dahil noong huminto na ang fx ay bumaba na rin ang babae. habang nag-lalakad kami ay hindi ko mapigilang mapa-ngiti dahil maaring mag-kalapit lang ang aming pinag-tatrabahuhan o sa iisang building lang kami at iba lang ang kumpanya. hindi ko alam kung anong nangyayari, pero parang hindi ako maka-hinga na nilalamig na nangiginig na nang-hihina na ewan. hindi ko ma-ipaliwanag ang halo-halong nararamdaman ko sa mga oras na iyon. sa sobrang pag-iisip ko ng mga nararamdaman ko ay hindi ko namalayan nawala na pala s'ya sa paningin ko. kaya naman inikot ko ang aking paningin, pero hindi ko na s'ya makita. hindi ako makapag-focus sa trabaho noong gabing iyon dahil hindi mawala sa isip ko ang maganda n'yang mukha. simple lang s'ya, oo. pero, may kakaiba akong naramdaman na hindi ko ma-ipaliwanag. ilang linggo na rin ang nag-daan pero hindi ko na s'ya nakita pa sa fx o kahit saan pa sa pag-lalakad ko sa lugar malapit sa office namin. halos ala-una na noon at kaka-para ko lang ng fx. papa-upo na sana ako ng may biglang may sumunod na sumakay at tumabi sa akin. sa isang iglap tila baga'y tumigil ang mundo ko at ang mga kakatuwang pakiramdam ko noong una ko s'yang nakita ay isa-isang nagbabalikan. sa wakas. ang babaeng ilang linggo ko ring hinanap, muli ay katabi ko ulit. halos hindi ko mapigilan ang pangi-nginig nang katawan ko noong mga oras na iyon. hindi ko alam anong gagawin. (inner monologue: ""sir, kalma ka lang. hingang malalim, dahan-dahang exhale. ayaw mo naman siguro maamoy 'yan ng magandang babae sa tabi mo? tama? kalma. inhale-exhale. pakalmahin mo 'yang sarili mo sir, baka mahalata ka. ang pangi-nginig, kalmahan mo lang sir. kalma."") unti-unti nga ay napa-kalma ko rin ang sarili ko. pero hindi pa rin mawala ang mga kakatuwang pakiramdlam sa loob ko. habang nasa byahe at katabi ko s'ya ay hindi ko mapigilang mapa-tingin sa tabi ko. aaminin ko, umaasa ako na sana antukin s'ya, pero... hehe. mukhang naparami ata ang inom n'ya ng kape at hindi s'ya inaantok. sayang. ang quarenta 'y singkong byahe na iyon ay tila ba'y naging dalawa o tatlong oras. hindi ko alam bakit... hindi ko talaga alam. hanggang ngayon ay nangiginig na kinakapos pa rin ako ng hininga kapag naa-alala ko iyon. (madaling araw kasi, tsaka, medyo malamig dahil sa habagat. hehe). matapos nga ang halos tatlong oras... ay, quarenta 'y singko lang pala na byaheng iyon ay hindi ko na hahayaang mawala s'ya sa paningin ko ng hindi ko nalalaman kung saang kumpanya s'ya nag-tatrabaho. para hindi halata na naghihintay ako ay medyo pina-una ko muna s'ya mag-lakad at kunyari'y nag-sintas muna ako ng aking sapatos. nang nakita kong naglalakad na s'ya ay agad-agad naman akong lumakad sa hindi kalayuan. unti-unti ay parang mas bumibilis ang tibok ng dibdib ko at mas lumalakas ang pangi-nginig ng buong katawan ko na halos nang-hihina na hindi ko maintindihan. ilang minuto pa ang naka-lipas ay nakita ko s'yang papasok na sa isang building na halos tatlong kanto lang ang layo kung saan ako nag-tatrabaho. ngayon, alam ko na kung saan s'ya nag-tatrabaho. kaya naman binilisan ko na ang pag-lalakad dahil male-late na ako. ilang araw din akong naghintay at umasang makaka-sabay ko s'ya sa fx, pero, nga-nga. wala na naman. alas-dose 'y medya na noon ng tanghali at naglalakad na ako papunta sa bus terminal. pagdating ko sa terminal ay doon sa upuan nag-seselpon ang isang magandang babae. sa hindi kalayuan ay naka-tayo lang ako at nag-mamasid. nahuhuli ko ang sarili ko na naka-titig sa kanya na para bang s'ya lang ang babae o tao sa paligid ko. para bang lahat ng nasa paligid ko ay unti-unting lumalabo at s'ya lang ang nakikita ko. maya't-maya rin ang lingon ko sa paligid-ligid dahil baka isipin ng mga tao na mina-manyak ko na ang babae sa dating ng titig ko. maya-maya pa ay dumating na ang bus na sasakyan ko. medyo punuan noon dahil tanghali at nasa kala-gitnaan ng metro manila ang kumpanya namin. kaya naman, pagdating ng mga bus sa terminal ay halos wala ka nang mauupuan pa. gaya ng inaasahan, parang mga zombie na nag-takbuhan ang mga tao papa-lapit sa bus. bilang hindi naman ako nag-mamadali at rd (rest day) ko naman bukas, hindi na ako nakipag-digmaan pa sa bukana nang pinto ng bus. umalis na nga ang bus at tsaka lang pumasok sa isip ko ang babae. (inner monologue: sir?! anong ginagawa mo?! wala na. naka-sakay na 'yun. bob* naman natin e. ano? ilang linggo ulit 'yan? tang* put*. wala na). anak nang!!! nawala sa isip ko ang babaeng halos apat na buwan ko na ring sinusubay-bayan.

Tagalized - Morgue.,"may nakita akong isang ad sa dyaryo, hindi man ako maka-paniwala at kinilabutan pero nakaka-anyaya ang sinasabi. ""gusto mo bang kumita ng 1000 pesos per night bilang security sa morge? apply na!"" medyo matagal na rin akong walang trabaho at makaka-bayad na rin ako ng upa at makapa-mamumuhay ng maginhawa kung magkataon. kaya naman nag-apply ako kahit medyo nag-dalawang-isip, inaasahan ko nang hindi ako makaka-kuha ng kahit anong sagot mula sa kumpanya. pero wala pang dalawang oras ay may natanggap akong email mula sa employer: ""maraming salamat sa ipinasa mong application form para sa posisyong night guard sa morge. masaya kong ibinabalita na ang mga skills na iyong binanggit ay tugma para sa hinahanap namin sa isang guard at gusto kitang offeran ng isang taong kontrata. kung ika'y sumasang-ayon sa mga kasunduan sa ibaba, maari lamang mag-iwan ka ng signature online via e-signature na naka-lista sa baba at pumunta ka sa (redacted) eksakto alas diyes ngayong gabi. makaka-tanggap ka ng 5000 linggo-linggo na direkta sa iyong bangko."" ngayong gabi? hindi ba masaydong mabilis ang mga pangyayari? pero hindi na ako nag-reklamo o tanong pa. hindi ko alam kung anong aasahan o kung sino ang madadatnan ko doon, kaya sinuot ko na 'yung damit at pantalon ko at agad nagtungo sa nasabing address nang mas maaga sa itinakdang oras. nandoon na ako ng mga alas nwebe kwarenta 'y singko ng gabi at may isang middle aged na lalaki na mukhang nag-tatrabaho sa morge ang bumati sa akin.

""ok. ano naman ang mga trabaho ko dito..."" pagsisimula ko. ""ahh, 'yun. wala naman gaano, siguraduhin mo lang na walang makakapasok."" - lumapit s'ya sa akin at sinabing - ""o labas."" isang maikling katahimikan at nagtinginan kaming dalawa, doon ay napa-ngiti ito at ang sabi: ""de, joke lang. so ayun, tapos na 'yung shift ko, kaya naman mauuna na ako. basta doon ka lang sa office at mag-relax hanggang alas sais ng umaga. doon darating na 'yung kahalili mo."" at doon nga ay umalis na s'ya. umupo ako sa upuan sa may office. akala ko siguro naman walang hindi magandang mangyayari. may papel sa harap ko at habang tinitignan ko ito ay doon ko lang napagtanto na ito ay listahan ng mga rules na specifically naka-asign sa akin. ito ang sabi: sa bagong gwardiya. welcome to the company. sa baba ay ang listahan ng mga rules para sa iyong trabaho: 1. ang una mong dapat gawin ay ang mag-conduct ng full sweep sa buong area para siguraduhin na walang kakaibang mga nangyayari liban sa ordinary (pati sa crypt). important note: kung may katawan man na naka-labas sa chambers sa loob ng crypt, itulak mo lamang ito pabalik. dapat manatili silang nasa-loob sa lahat ng pagkakataon. 2. matapos ang buong sweep, maari ka nang manatili sa loob ng office hanggang matapos ang shift mo. may iba pang mga rules na naka-lista sa baba, pero nag-desisyon akong libutin muna ang buong lugar. medyo may kaliitan ang morge, may isang malaking medical room na halos mapuno ng medical supplies ang loob. pero may sapat na espasyo para sa 2-3 lamesa na puwedeng pag-lagyan ng mga labi. sa loob ng crypt ay may palikuran. nag-desisyon akong unahin na ang pinaka-ayaw kong lugar - 'yung crypt. umalis na ako sa office at binuksan ang solid at napaka-bigat na pinto ng crypt, agad-agad ay sinalubong ako ng napaka-lamig na hangin. sa loob, may dalawang katawan sa gitna ng kwarto at mga chambers sa pader. lahat naman sila ay sarado kaya naman mabilis akong lumabas ng kwarto. habang pabalik ako mula sa bathroom, may nakita akong lalaki na naka lab coat na naka-tayo sa gitna ng medical room. parang may kinakalikot gamit ang mga medical tools malapit sa isang body bag. ""tang... tinakot mo naman ako boss."" - sabi ko. tinignan n'ya ako na parang wala lang at bumalik sa ginagawa nito. ""akala ko umuwi na ang lahat. ako nga pala si michael, bagong gwardiya."" - sabi ko, gaya ng nauna, hindi n'ya ako pinansin. kumaway na ako at umalis pabalik ng office. babasahin ko na sana ulit ang mga rules ng biglang may matinis na tunog akong narinig na para bang may bakal na kumi-kiskis sa isa pang bakal na nag-eecho sa buong building. medyo mahina na ito at parang nang-gagaling sa mga tubo. tumagal din iyon ng ilang segundo at huminto sa kaparehas na segundo. hindi ko na lang pinansin at i-idlip na lang, check ng cell phone. pero medyo tumatagal na ang tunog at habang mas kinikilabutan ako ay unti-unti nang nagbabago ang kanina'y parang bakal na kumi-kiskis sa isa't-isa ay naging... ungol. lumabas ako ng office at tatanungin ko sana 'yung kaninang naka lab coat pero mukhang naka-uwi na s'ya sa mga oras na 'yun. hindi ako sigurado kung saan mismo nang-gagaling ang tunog, pero parang sa may crypt, kaya naman pinuntahan ko ito. 'yung oras na binuksan ko ang pinto ay ang buong building ay nanahimik. huminga ako ng malalim at napansin ko na 'yung isang chambers ay naka-bukas na ng bahagya. tinulak ko ito pabalik at agad-agad na bumalik sa office. nawala na ng tuluyan ang matinis na na para bang ungol na iyon. nagpatuloy ako sa pagbabasa: 3. maari kang matulog sa office, pero dapat handa ka sa mga mangyayari. sleep at your own risk, ika nga nila. matapos nun ay isang napaka-lakas na tunog ang halos mag-patalon sa buong pagkatao ko. ""tulong! palabasin n'yo ako dito!"" - ang boses ay tila nang-gagaling sa mga tubo. tumayo ako habang sobra ang kalabog ng dibdib ko. ""palabasin n'yo ako, hindi ako maka-hinga!"" - paulit-ulit na pagmama-kaawa ng boses na ngayon ay may kasama ng kalabog. binuksan ko ang pintuan ng office at sa hindi malaman na dahilan sa crypt nang-gagaling ang boses. nanginginig, pero binuksan ko ang pinto. ""buhay pa ako, isa itong pagkakamali! tulong!"" - mas lalong lumakas ang boses nung oras na buksan ko ang napaka-bigat at solidong pinto. ""asan ka?!"" - nanginginig akong tumingin sa paligid, habang ang walang humpay na tumatawag ang boses na may kasamang malalakas na kalabog. lumapit ako at unti-unting inilapit ang tenga para maka-siguro na ang bubuksan ko ay ang tamang chamber. ""buhay pa ako! utang na loob! ple----"" ang boses at ang mga kalabog ay daglian na lamang nawala nang biglaan kong binuksan ang isa sa mga chambers at sinalubong ako ng malamig na bangkay ng isang middle-aged na lalaki. tumayo lang ako doon, nakatitig sa bangkay, halos tumigil sa pagtakbo ang isip ko sa kung ano ang mga nangyayari. malinaw na malinaw kong narinig at naramdaman ko ang bawat kalabog nung oras na hinawakan ko ang hawakan ng chamber at para bang may kung sino man na bigla-bigla na lang nagpatigil nito. pinaglalaruan lang ba ako ng aking isipan? tinulak ko ang chamber pabalik at mabilis na umalis doon, nilock ang pinto ng office. iniisip ko na ang pag-aaply sa trabahong 'to ay maaring isang malaking pagkakamali. pakiramdam ko na nababaliw na ako, pero agad ko ring kinumbinse ang sarili ko na nasa ulo ko lang lahat ng 'to. nagpatuloy ako sa pagbabasa ng mg rules: 4. puwede kang mag-patugtog para maibsan ang katahimikan basta't hindi ito makaka-kuha ng atensyon sa labas. 5. kung may marinig kang hindi mo maipaliwanag na ingay galing sa may crypt, 'wag mo na lamang ito pansinin. 6. kung ang mga ingay na 'yun ay naging sigaw ng pagpapanic, gawin ang mga sumusunod: • kung ang mga sigaw ay mula sa babae, 'wag mo pansinin hanggang sa tumigil ito. 'wag na 'wag kang papasok sa loob ng crypt sa mga oras na nangyayari ito sa kahit anong dahilan. • kung ang mga ingay ay mula sa lalaki, hanapin ang pinag-mumulan ng ingay at hatakin ang chamber. dapat huminto na ang ingay pagkatapos mong mabuksan ang chamber. doon na nagtatapos ang page. nilapag ko na ang papel at dahan-dahang inilapat ang likod ko sa upuan. ala una na noon at nag-sisimula na akong antukin. maya-maya pa ay nagsisimula ng pumikit ang aking mga mata ng kusa. nagsisimula na akong mahulog sa panaginip nang biglang may mahigpit akong hawak na naramdaman sa likod ng aking balikat. sa sobrang gulat ko ay agad-agad akong napatayo at sinipa ang upuan. walang tao o kahit ano noong mga oras na iyon. hindi na ako inaantok nung mga oras na 'yun. tahimik na ang buong kapaligiran noon at nagpunta ako sa palikuran. pagbalik ko ay alas tres na at halos handa na akong tapusin ang shift ko dito. napagisip-isip ko na hindi na rin masama para sa isang libo, hanggang tinalikod ko ang papel na may mga rules at napansin kong may naka-sulat pa sa likod: 7. lahat ng staff ay lalabas o dapat nasa labas na ng building bago mag alas diyes ng gabi, kaya kung may makita kang lalaki na naka lab coat during your shift, 'wag na 'wag sa kahit ano mang sitwasyon na subukan mong makipag-usap sa kanya. paulit-ulit-ulit kong binasa ang rule ng limang beses, pero wala pa ring nagbabago sa naka-sulat. may mahinang katok sa pinto ng office. tinignan ko ito at sa likod ng salamin ay nakita ko ang lalaking naka lab coat naka-ngiti sa akin. alas kwatro 'y media na at patuloy pa rin s'ya sa pagkatok. sa mga magta-tanong, hindi ko na ho alam kung saan ko ito nakuha dahil 2018 ko pa po ito tinagalog. nakita ko lang na naka-save pa rin sa note ng selpon ko. salamat and ang init. tangina.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/t8j464/tagalized_morgue/,7 03 2022
Nakakapanghina.,"okay, this is gonna be a rant. kanina pa ko umiiyak. gusto ko lang ilabas emosyon ko. i just found out the issue about rappler. parang nanghihina katawan ko, ano ba nangyayari sa bansa natin?? i was once a dds, pero yung parents ko at mga relatives dds parin. as in, halos buong barangay namin puro dds. because of that, growing up i was conditioned to believe that all of duterte's critics are just biased towards the 'dilawans'. i always despise all those people because i thought they just don't understand his leadership. i hated rappler, abs-cbn, journalists like karen davila, up, activists, i also started labeling all those people who got red-tagged as npa. when maria ressa recieved her nobel peace prize, i laughed–because i thought the western world don't know anything about her being biased. i thought she doesn't deserve that medal because she's a 'bayarang' journalist and the freedom of speech in this country is not even at risk. this election has opened my eyes so much. i started seeing the problems in our country more objectively. nakita ko kung paano kabulok yung sistema natin, pati narin yung kamalian at kapalpakan ng administrasyong ito. i saw how duterte made this country so divisive. that's why i rooted for vp leni to win. months ago, i was full of hope. i always look forward to the news updating about her campaign. i even convinced my parents to vote for her (kasi hindi pa ako makakaboto) kahit nag-aaway na kami, pero ayaw parin talaga nila. kaya nung natalo siya umiyak talaga ako. antagal kong maka-move on. when june came, i was in my acceptance stage. naisip ko siguro may plano ang diyos, siguro sa loob ng six years magigising yung mga tao at maisip nilang nagkamali sila, o baka siguro makansela yung coc ni 88m at si leni talaga yung uupong presidente. pero ngayon, nakakapanlumo. yesterday, it was announced that marcos jr's dq cases were all dismissed. and now, sec ordered to shut down rappler. what's more heartbreaking is that these past few months i found myself actually enjoying the content i consume from rappler. i've been reading lots of their articles–especially, their editorials, and also binge watching all their tiktok videos. and then i thought to myself, all those things i said about them were actually the result of being a fanatic towards duterte. they are the ones who are the most critical in this administration, they are also one of those news sites who really provides so much analysis whenever there's a political issue surfacing. just earlier i went to social media, and guess what?? people were celebrating. they said rappler deserves it because of being bias. hindi man lang nila naisip na siguro may paglabag na ito sa kalayaang pamamahayag. their logic is basically, ""if you're bias/criticize our president, then you deserve to be shut down"". nakakaputangina😭😭 'yung una abs, ngayon rappler naman. ano ba susunod? i know i don't deserve this kind of government. gusto kong lumaking malayang pinapahayag ang pananalita ko nang hindi natatakot. ano bang kasalanan ko bakit dito pa talaga ako sa impyernong bansa to ipinanganak?! nakakapagod na😭😭 as you can see, journalists, activists and the opposition were now all demonized because of pdutz. red-tagging is everywhere, vloggers who spread fake news are being prioritized, people who critize this administration are harrassed in social media, those covicted politicians from previous admin were freed meanwhile leila de lima–a known critic of duterte is still in the prison, and don't forget the militirization of up campuses. as much as i can remember, at the time of pnoy all these things don't even exist despite of many backlash from the people. before, there was this thing called ""freedom of speech"" wala na talaga pagasa bansa natin. gusto kong umalis pero wala naman akong pera tapos minor de edad pa. tangina mo duterte!! tangina mo marcos!! tangina nyo 31m!! tangina niyo mga panatiko!! tagina lahat ng mga pulitikong bayaran!! good luck na lang talaga sa six years😭😭😭",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/vn93po/nakakapanghina/,29 06 2022
Story time: Uninformed News Edition,"a friend showed me a tiktok video of a supposed influencer sharing his thoughts on covid. the video (with embedded texts) went like this: ""storytime: covid 19 edition and then dinala sa hospital, dead on arrival. then sabi nung doctor sa mga kamag anak. kung papayag yung family na ang ilagay sa death cert nung namatay ay covid instead of heart attack 😱😱. so yun lang, idk what to do with that information kaya skl."" let me answer you, what you should do with that information is ask someone who is knowledgeable on the topic or at least someone who knows more than you do, cause you definitely don't know a lot. what you should not do though is post a video putting the hospital and medical professionals in a malicious light. for those of you who wants to be educated on the topic: anyone who is symptomatic, we can't mix with those who do not have the symptoms. ubo, sipon, lagnat, hirap sa paghinga, pananakit ng kasukasuan, pagsusuka, pagtatae or pagkawala ng pang-amoy at panlasa. you might be wondering, eh ang daming sakit with the same symptoms. yes, kaya nga po puno ang emergency rooms and covid floors. unless proven na negative ka sa covid (with rt-pcr), it is prudent that we don't place you with those without the symptoms. hospital protocols also dictates that anyone who arrives dead will be tagged as covid suspect (relating to the tiktok vid, paano nasabing heart attack? may ckmb ka? may trop i ka? may ecg ka ba???). covid also complicates underlying conditions like heart, brain problems which might have led to the demise of the patient. did the patient die of a heart problem? possible. did the patient die of covid? possible. hindi sya exclusive, and unless we do post-mortem swab, we will not know. the government ideally should fund more research centers and laboratories, to make testing more available kahit sa maralita. sayang yung mga inutang. hindi lahat ng tao afford ang 2-5k na rt-pcr swab na may 7 days validity lang. pag may rt-pcr ka na timely ang collection, you need not be tagged as suspect and can be treated sa covid negative area, therefore decongesting the covid suspect area, therefore freeing some resources that can be used for those in critical conditions. i am all for freedom of expression, but i also believe in responsible posting. supposed ~influencers~ should help us eradicate misinformation, use their platform for greater good. you also address your audience well. isang taon na tayong lockdown, ang dami nang dinagdag na letra sa cq. baka naman po? if you have any questions, if in any way i can explain things in simpler terms. i also urge people in the medical field to answer people the simplest way possible, to be ""patola"" na. our job extends way outside the corners of the hospital. di na lang covid ang kalaban, bad governance, ignorance and misinformation too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/mgihgq/story_time_uninformed_news_edition/,30 03 2021
Naturopathic Medicine in Philippines,"so. we have this client na “doctor” ng naturopathic medicine. she’s old na like mga nasa early 70’s. wayback pre pandemic (february 2020) sinabi niya na etong corona virus is a “scare tactics” daw para kumita yung malalaking medical company. she also added “sa china kasi madaming mahihirap kaya madaming malnourished thence spreading the virus” so naisip ko rin na baka nga vitamins lang katapat. the pandemic and lockdown happened. may meeting kami sa kanya and she gives us this silver colloidal naka boteng maliliit and isang 6 gallon na lalagyan. i dont think na fda approved and registered yon. i also researched na may adverse side effects yon. pinapainom niya sa amin yon and she claimed na wala daw side effects. but we insist. yung 6 gallon na lalagyan, ayun wala pa sa kalahati apat na buwan na. hahahh napaisip talaga ako kung doctor ba talaga siya nung sinabi niya during meeting na “wag kayo magsusuot ng face mask kasi masama yon. naiinhale lang din yung carbon dioxide sa katawan” yup as same as dj loonyo’s comment. how come na “doctor” sya tapos magcocomment sya ng ganon? the news broke out about sa use ng hydrochloroquine on treating covid. and guess what? meron syang bote na maliit (kasing laki ng lalgyanan ng essential oil pang air diffuser) non. i don’t know kung saan niya pinag kukuha yon haha. also di rin nakawala yung ivermectin. i’ve seen her sharing post sa fb good things about it. pinagtatanggol niya talaga ang ivermectin. binigyan nya yung mga ksamahan ko isang banig. ang nakakabahala pa don, sa banig ng gamot na yon, walang ni isang letter na nakasulat. yup as in yung aluminum lang ang makikita mo sa likod. wala rin labels sa mismong tablet. vaccine? of course. wala. hahaha. pero sinabi niya. in a drop-dead-serious face “oy kayo, wag kayong magpapabakuna ah” like sabi ko sa isip ko p*tangina doctor ka ba talaga? i get it naman na she’s into natural medicine. but there are some things na separate sa natural med from modern medicine. i just found out na walang “md” sa titles niya. ibig sabihin it is illegal na mag practice sya ng medicine.

"Sorry, but I think the internet is indeed a factor why many people are ""depressed"" right now, BUT that's not necessarily a bad thing.","so i saw this short clip on facebook. galing siya sa isang film featuring tony labrusca. tony told her mom he's depressed, and the mom went ballistic, saying shits like depression is just a trend online. while i don't believe that depression is a trend, i do think the internet is also a reason why more and more middle-class people claim they're depression. sa palagay ko, ito ay parehong panget at mabuti -- pero mas matimbang ang mabuti kesa panget. let's talk about why is it a bad thing first. simple lang: some people might misinterpret this validation, and rather than dealing with their pains, they became addicted to it and became their sort of comfort. kumbaga, the internet validation became a new form of addiction -- gaya ng kung bakit may mga nalululong sa online games, pagkain, at droga. i've observed this a lot in the west. halimbawa nga, some of them gets offended with the word ""fat"" or ""obese"". dapat daw plus-size or the new sexy ang tawag para di masakit sa pandinig. see? rather than dealing with their insecurity, they resorted to demonizing an adjective, and that's a bad thing. nagiging eggshell na ang mga tao, all for the sake of not offending someone who has issues. now, let's talk about the good thing. syempre, unang-una dyan ang validation ulit. gaya rin ng pagkain, online games, and even drugs, wala naman talagang masama sa validation *as long as* you know your limit. most of you probably already know sugar is addicting, and is probably more addicting than marijuana, but hey, we don't hear people asking to ban sugar. even nutritionists themselves aren't saying that. ang lagi lang nilang sinasabi ay hinay-hinay lang. if you consumed it moderately, sobrang helpful iyon sa katawan mo especially if you're physically active. ganoon din sa validation. maraming middle class/rich kid na lumaki sa toxic positivity mindset. because of this, their frustrations were forced to repress simply because someone had it worse. pinagdaanan ko rin ito, sa totoo lang. my grandma loves to tell me na swerte ako dahil marino si papa at malaki ang sahod kaya hindi ko naranasan maghirap noon. anong naging epekto sakin? i was forced to conceal my angsts. dahil hindi ko mailabas, naipon lang nang naipon sa dibdib ko. parang naging time bomb siya, and it exploded in 2019, after my break-up with my long-term boyfriend. i felt so miserable. i'm still dealing with numbness and suicidal ideation until now. mabuti na lang, i have a good support group. gusto ko sanang mag-therapy pero ayoko kasi ng epekto ng gamot sakin, so i chose not to seek it. what could have happened if iba ang upbringing ko? i probably would have a better coping mechanism. right now, my coping mechanism is being workaholic, since it helps me distract myself from pain, pero hindi rin maganda ito. dami ko ngang pera pero di naman ako masaya sa buhay ko. that's why right now, i'm learning to balance my social life and work. heck, pati sex life and fitness, i'm slowly incorporating it to my lifestyle. isa pang bagay na maganda sa awareness ng mental health online ay yung mapuputol na natin ang siklo. let's admit it, one of the reasons why the gen xers and the generation earlier romanticized hard work and abuses so much is because ganoon sila pinaniwala. kaya nga karamihan sa mga toxic boss at customer ay mga galing sa henerasyon na ito. karamihan sa kanila ay mayroong anger management issue. naalala ko nga sa first job ko, i was bullied by my workmates, who are mostly 40+ and older. natutuwa kasi boss namin sakin dahil mabilis ako magtrabaho, and these people saw me as a threat, so they're bullying me through cold treatment. tapos lagi pa akong pinagchichismisan, at hindi rin ako sinasabihan kapag may announcement. it’s affecting my job a lot. so iyon, umalis ako after six months. nagalit si tita ko sakin, saying i should just shrug it off. imagine, rather than saying ang toxic ng ka-work ko, ako pa ang mali? but then, iyon kasi ang kinagisnan nilang buhay. through the mh awareness, the younger generation can break this cycle. we learn to be kinder and be less tolerant to bullshit like this, and i think that’s the best part. after all, bukod sa mali naman talaga ang bullying, counterproductive din ito, lalo na sa office. halimbawa na nga lang itong experience ko sa first work ko. natutuwa si boss sakin because i’m efficient. that efficiency decreased because of the bullying. remember, from an economic perspective, productivity loss will also result in income loss, which sadly many insecure coworkers didn’t know. hindi lang ako ang apektado kundi ang kumpanyang pinagtratrabahuhan nila. in the long run, sila rin ang maapektuhan sa ganitong kultura. and speaking of efficiency, mh awareness also improves it. think about it: hindi ka makakapagtrabaho nang matino kung burnt out ka, hindi ba? and this is not just anecdotal evidence. years ago, microsoft japan conducted a study to know what would happen if they implement a 4-day work system. japan is notorious for their overworking culture, so this is frowned upon. and surprisingly, mas malaki pa ang income nila during the time 4-day work happens. mas productive ang mga tao dahil hindi sila masyadong pagod. hindi rin uso yung pinapabagal ang trabaho para lang mapagkasya ng eight hours ang pwede sanang gawin within 3-4 hour. and nakatipid pa sila sa operating expenses dahil tatlong araw na walang gumagamit ng office. see? efficient, and it all started because microsoft is trying to improve the mental health state of their employees. the verdict? the internet does play a factor on why more people are self-diagnosing. but if you think about it, the benefits outweigh the liability. hindi lang natin natutulungan ang mga tao, but it would also improve the economy. it’s a win-win suggestion. recommendation? normalize validating your pain, but don’t overdo it as it would lead to addiction in the long run.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/oco9gn/sorry_but_i_think_the_internet_is_indeed_a_factor/,3 07 2021
sample ng fake news na nakalat sa fb messenger,"bill gates, na napunta kay satanas at mga illuminati na microchip tas meron pang id 2020, e 2021 na.. kalungkot lang kasi kahit mismo mong mga kamaganak pa yung mga tumatangkilik sa mga fake news na ganito na nakalat sa messenger. karamihan jan sa mga kamag anak ko na bilib na bilib sa mga yan ay yung mga nasa probinsya, bat ba ganyan. kung ano pa yung fake news mas trip pa nila paniwalaan, kasi mas may thrill yang ganyang news? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ nagkabulgaran na 📷📷📷 scam ang covid... totoo ba ito? 📷📷📷 yung covid ay parang flu lang talaga yun bini brainwash tayo ng mga globalists na nakakatakot yun para macontrol nila ang buong mundo at iyan nga ang nangyayari ngayon. ang motibo nila ay pabagsakin ang economiya. then impose the new world order---one world government, one world religion, one world currency. they have began with the ""new normal"" which is abnormal. sa loob lamang ng mahigit isang buwan ay naganap ang gusto nilang mangyari: lockdown, ecq-gcq-ecq-gcq, social distancing, wearing of masks, etc. dahil hinihintay daw, within 18 months, ilalabas nila yung vaccine na lahat ay irerequire na magpaturok. yung vaccine na yun ay quantum dots. bakit 18 months? kasi 18=6+6+6 or 666, the mark of the beast. lahat ng matuturukan ay bibigyan ng id na ang tawag ay id2020 at isa pa, eventually, lalagyan ng microchips ang mga mababakunahan which can contain info of the person and will also be used for all transactions na gagawin niya. yung social distancing, sinasanay na ang tao para mas madaling mamonitor pag layu-layo through 5g technology. i might be wrong, pero ano pa ang maiisip natin? yung mask, kunwari for our protection pero in reality, it will suffocate the lungs. just imagine hindi ka makalanghap ng sariwang hangin. it makes us more susceptible to viruses. the globalists are really killing the people slowly. yung social distancing, pababagsakin ng todo ang ekonomiya dahil hindi makapag-full force work ang mga tao. yung sobrang lockdown ay pababagsakin din ang health natin, as explained by the doctors in the video. yung mga globalists ay kasama sila bill gates, rockefeller foundation, big pharma, dr. fauci, who, mga bayarang scientists, at yung iba pang super yaman sa mundo. kasama rin si pope, at ang china--the sleeping giant who is now slowly rising--the dragon in the bible. malapit na ang tribulation period kung mananagumpay ang plano ng mga ito. lahat ay nakalatag na. that is, if we allow these globalists to push through with their agenda, and if jesus christ will hastens his coming again. sa ating mananampalataya, walang problema dahil kung malapit na ang tribulation, mas malapit na ang pagparito ng pang.jesus. kaya tama ang ginagawa nating soul winning through celfone. pero kailangan din nating ipaalam sa mga tao ang balak ng mga globalists na ito. we have human rights na inalis sa loob lamang ng mahigit isang buwan. sana nga matauhan na ang mga mayor pataas hanggang kay president duterte gaya ng nangyari kay president trump at yung nagsalita sa video sa italy na nagsabing hindi naman talaga 25,000 ang namatay sa covid sa italy gaya ng nakatala sa covid count at ibinalita sa media. yan ang power ng mga bayarang media. according to present studies about covid patients, 99% of those who died ay may ibang sakit. yun namang na-test na may covid ay 88-90% sa kanila ay nakaka-recover at 10-12% lang ang namamatay. pag ikinumpara sa population ng buong mundo, napaka minimal ng death, 0.00 something lang in percentage. in other words, hindi talaga sya pandemic but plan demic. saka bakit puro covid cases na lang ang nirereport na cause of death. kasi doctors are being pressured to include covid as the cause of death. malaki pala ang incentive ng mga hospitals pag covid ang ikinamatay. pera-pera lang talaga. sana makatulong ang mga may katungkulan sa pagsisiwalat ng katotohanan. hwag nating pahintulututan na manatili tayong sunud-sunuran sa isang systema na ang diablo ang nananagumpay. iparating natin sa pamahalaan ang katotohanan habang may access pa tayo sa media. while it is true that we must obey government rules, we also have the responsibility to tell the people and government officials about the truth. let the people know the truth, may god bless us all. copy paste if you care godbless us all📷📷📷 ctto 27 minutes ago · sent from mobile bagong pasa po ito now lang, pls pass to inform lahat ng filipino. ""be aware huwag kayong maniwala dyan sa vaccine nayan. automatic na magpa- positive ka sa covid pag tinest kahit walang sakit. yan raw ang pinasa sa congress dito. malapit na nila ilabas ang vaccine ngayon na may microchip. huwag kayong magpapa- vaccine pag lumabas nayan dyan sa pinas, kasi ibang klaseng needles ang ginagamit tulad sa europe na my microchip. ipakalat at ipaalam nyo sa lahat ng mga kaanak nyo... hindi yan biro, itong virus ang way nila para ma implement ang microchip... yan ang makikita pag mag oopen ng website, ng us. nakakatakot yan pag napasa na. ... pwede na silang basta pumasok sa loob ng bahay mo, pag nag mandatory nayan... tiyak, magkakaroon ng war dito sa us. dahil maraming against sa mandatory. sa canada, sapilitang pumupunta sa bahay para pilitin ang mga tao na ma test ng covid. pag mangyari yan, lahat na bansa susunod na. may nag test na niyan dito gamit ang papaya fruit at nagka positive ang papaya sa covid. ito ang sinasabi na bawasan ang bilyon bilyong tao sa mundo. mga kampon sila ng diablo, lahat ng testing kits galing sa us, kaya ang mga tao di na naniwala sa numbers of covid. yung dr. fuchi na nagsabi na my vaccine na para sa covid, kasabwat siya ni bill gates. si bill gates ang punot dulo ng lahat ng virus nayan. pastor kasi siya sa illuminati, isang devil church. siya ang gumawa ng covid virus at dinala sa china at pag kumalat na sa buong mundo, siya na din ang maglalabas ng vaccine, panlaban sa virus. plano na nila yan lahat dahil ito ang nakasulat sa revelation. mostly, lahat na nga ng tao dito, may baril kaya pag mag mamandatory nayan dito sa us, war talaga ang mangyaryari. yung mga doctors mismo ang nagsabi na di maganda ang vaccine sa katawan dahil puro chemicals ang ingredients at my biochip. may mga videos na dinidelete na sa youtube, para hindi na mapanood ng mga tao. basahin nyo agad ito, bago nila burahin... dahil lahat ng information about sa gamot ng china virus, o sa plano ng ""who"" at ""doh"" ,at ng mga gobyerno... pinabubura agad nla."" pls forward...",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/nmlku1/sample_ng_fake_news_na_nakalat_sa_fb_messenger/,28 05 2021

madalas ko ngang kinukurot at sinasampal ang mukha ko para masiguradong hindi ako nananaginip. &#x200b; apat na taon na kami ng aking mahal na nobya. noong niligawan ko siya, lahat ng mga kaibigan at kapitbahay ko sinabihan ako na huwag ko na raw ituloy dahil bad news daw siya at mapapariwara lamang ako kapag naging kami. na may ""something"" daw ang pamilya nila sa probinsya. bagong lipat lang ako sa lugar na iyon at mag-a-anim na buwan pa lamang doon nang makilala ko ang nobya ko. hindi ako nakinig sa mga sinasabi nila, mga tsismoso at mga tsimosa, at itinuloy ang panliligaw. hindi nagtagal, sinagot din niya ako at talagang sobrang ligaya ko simula noon. lahat ng mga nagsabing mapapariwara raw ako, hindi ko na sila mga kaibigan ngayon. &#x200b; last year lang, nagsimula na kaming mag-live in. kumuha kami ng condo sa taguig at talagang sobrang saya namin. halos wala kaming problema, wala kaming anumang away. at siyempre, dahil iyon sa sinusunod ko ang mga special rules. &#x200b; well, wala naman talaga siyang special rules para sa akin. kung ano ang gusto at ayaw ng mga pangkaraniwang babae sa kanilang nobyo, ganoon din naman siya. sa totoo lang, mas maluwag pa siya sa ibang mga naging girlfriend ko dati. understanding siya, hindi demanding. kaya mahal na mahal ko siya! &#x200b; ang tinutukoy kong mga ""rules"" ay mga simpleng observations ko lamang sa kanya. mga bagay na hindi naman niya ipinagbabawal o dine-demand pero mas maganda kung alam mo. ito ang susi ng aming napakasaya at very smooth na relationship. hindi ba't may kasabihan tayo na, ""ang nagsasama nang matapat at sumusunod sa mga rules ng girlfriend niya, nagsasama nang maluwat."" &#x200b; heto ang mga simpleng rules kaya't perfect ang relationship namin ng aking perfect girlfriend. konti lang naman sila: &#x200b; rule #1. ayaw na ayaw ng girlfriend ko ang mga simbahan. hindi kasi siya religious at ang sabi niya, na-trauma raw siya dahil pinalaki siya ng kanyang lola na super relihiyosa. isa yatang panatiko ang lola niya na miyembro ng isang religious group sa probinsya nila na masasabing parang kulto na nga. kaya't kapag nakakakita siya ng mga churches (kahit anong religion), parang sumasama ang pakiramdam niya. isang beses nga, dumaan ako sa isang kalsada na hindi pamilyar sa akin. ang sabi kasi ng ka-opisina ko, shortcut daw iyon. kaya hindi ko alam na mayroon palang simbahang dadaanan. pagdaan na pagdaan ng kotse ko sa tapat ng simbahan, biglang nagtitili ang girlfriend ko. nagpupumiglas siya, parang nasasaktan ang buong katawan. grabeng trauma siguro ang sinapit niya sa kamay ng lola niya kaya ganoon ang reaksyon niya. kaya binilisan ko ang pagpapatakbo ng kotse ko hanggang sa makalayo kami roon. saka lamang siya huminahon. umiiyak siya, humihingi ng sorry. naiintindihan ko naman siya, wala siyang kasalanan. biktima lamang siya. hinaplos ko ang kanyang buhok at pinunasan ang kanyang mga luha. doon ko lang napansin na namumula ang kanyang noo at mga pisngi. pati mga braso niya ay namumula rin. nang pansinin ko ito, ang sabi niya ay baka nauntog siya o naihampas ang mga braso sa dashboard o sa bintana noong nagpupumiglas siya. niyaya ko siyang dalhin sa ospital pero tumanggi siya. sasabihin ko sanang imposibleng nauntog siya dahil hindi naman mukhang mga pasa ang nasa kanyang mukha at mga braso kundi mukha itong parang nasunog ngunit bigla siyang ngumiti, ang kanyang perpektong mga ngiti, kaya't nakumbisi na rin ako na okay na siya. pagkauwi namin, wala nang anumang bakas sa kanyang mukha na nauntog siya. &#x200b; kaya't kapag bumabiyahe kami, kailangang planuhin ang rutang dadaanan namin at siguraduhing hindi kami malalapit sa anumang simbahan. &#x200b; rule #2. hindi kumakain ng gulay ang girlfriend ko. siguro naman, marami sa inyo ganito ang mga girlfriend. mahilig sa meat pero ayaw kumain ng gulay. nakakatuwa, hindi ba? ako rin naman hindi masyadong mahilig sa gulay. kaya't kung kakain kami o lalabas, laging meat ang kinakain namin. hilig nga niya 'yung mga unli na barbecue. lalo na 'yung mayroong mga lamanloob. paboritong-paborito niya ang atay, intestines, puso, utak, at kung anu-ano pa. mahilig din siya sa dinuguan. minsan nga, isinama niya ako sa isang exclusive restaurant. mga members lang daw ang pwedeng kumain doon at miyembro siya at ang kanyang mga parents. nasa isang subdivision ito na puro mayayaman lamang ang nakatira. sa labas, mukha lang itong malaking mansyon pero pagpasok mo, isa pala itong restaurant. grabe, mayayaman talaga ang mga kumakain doon. may nakita pa nga akong mga artista at mga pulitiko. &#x200b; ang specialty ng restaurant na iyon ay mga lamanloob. tuwang-tuwa ang girlfriend ko nang orderin niya ang soup number 5. pinakain niya sa akin iyon at pinaubos dahil aphrodisiac daw iyon. masaya ko namang sinunod ito kahit na first time ko kumain noon. excited din ako dahil siguradong mapapalaban ako sa mangyayaring bakbakan pagkauwi namin. medyo natigilan lang ako noong una kong makita. ang alam ko kasi, ang main ingredient ng soup number 5 ay ari at bayag ng isang kalabaw. pero, noong pagsandok ko, parang iba ang nakita ko. parang iba ang hugis, parang malapit sa tao. pero siyempre, hindi ko na 'yun pinansin at siguradong imahinasyon ko lamang iyon. &#x200b; rule #3. hindi mahilig magpa-picture at mag-selfie ang aking girlfriend. ayaw na ayaw niya na kuhanan siya ng litrato, lalo na kung stolen. kaya nga kapag lumalabas kami, lagi siyang naka-cap at naka-long sleeves na jacket na may hoodie (ayaw niya rin kasi ang naaarawan). noong bago pa lamang kami, sinubukan ko siyang kuhanan ng picture nang palihim. pagtingin ko, nagtaka ako dahil parang deformed ang hitsura niya sa larawan. ni-restart ko ang phone ko at inulit pero ganoon pa rin. kaya tumabi ako sa kanya at mabilis na kumuha ng selfie. grabe ang galit niya sa akin! pinagsusuntok niya ako pero tinanggap ko ang lahat hanggang sa mawala ang galit niya. mga six months din bago ko nakita 'yung picture sa phone ko. inabot din kasi ng six months bago natanggal ang cast sa mga braso at binti ko. &#x200b; pagtingin ko sa picture na kinuha ko (kinuha ng girlfriend ko 'yung cellphone ko at itinago pero nakita ko rin naman sa closet niya noong makalabas ako sa ospital), naguluhan ako sa nakita ko. sa larawan, nakatingin ako sa camera at nakangiti. sa tabi ko, may isang matandang babae ang nakaupo. kulubot na ang kanyang mga mukha at kulay abo na ang mga buhok. suot-suot niya ang favorite t-shirt ng nobya ko. &#x200b; napailing na lang ako sa nakita ko. bilib na bilib pa naman ako sa camera ng iphone pero mukhang nagma-malfunction din pala ito. kaya ngayon, samsung na ang telepono ko. hindi ko na rin kinuhanan pa ng litrato ang girlfriend ko. &#x200b; rule #4. huwag magpapakita ng kabaitan sa ibang mga babae. ops! baka isipin niyo na selosa at mahigpit ang girlfriend ko. naku, diyan po kayo nagkakamali. sa katunayan, ayos lang sa kanya na makipagkaibigan ako sa mga babae. hindi siya nagagalit o nagtatampo. naalala ko nga noon, mayroon akong naging kaibigang babae sa trabaho, si carla. siyempre, tayong mga lalaki, natural na friendly tayo sa mga kababaihan. accomodating tayo at mahilig magbiro at mag-joke. madalas tuloy ay pinaghihinalaan tayo ng ating mga girlfriends. pero, iba ang girlfriend ko. ayos lang sa kanya ang ganoon. kahit nakikita niyang magkasama kami ni carla at nagtatawanan kapag bumibisita siya sa office, hindi siya nagagalit. nakakalungkot nga lang na hindi na natin kapiling si carla ngayon. natagpuan na lang siya isang umaga sa kuwarto niya, patay na. noong bumisita ako sa burol niya, nasabi sa akin ng kapatid niya na na-overdose daw sa gamot si carla. pagpasok daw nila sa kuwarto niya, nakita nila si carla na nakahiga sa kama, bumubula ang bibig. sa tabi niya, maraming nagkalat na gamot. puro tusok din ng karayom ang buong katawan niya. marahil daw, dahil sa depresyon o anumang mental illness, tinusok-tusok ni carla ang sarili niya ng karayom at pagkatapos ay uminom ng maraming gamot. ang nakapagtataka lamang daw, wala silang nakitang anumang karayom sa kuwarto ni carla. &#x200b; gaya nga ng sabi ko, hindi selosa ang girlfriend ko. marami akong mga naging kaibigang babae. nandyan si cherry na dating classmate ko noong college. marahil ay nakita mo siya sa balita. isang gabi kasi, habang papauwi galing trabaho, may tumulak daw sa kanya kaya nasagasaan siya ng isang bus. naging close ko rin si june at si barbie. kaso lang, maaga silang kinuha ni lord. bigla na lang silang na-comatose at hindi na nagising. over-fatigued daw sabi ng mga doktor. &#x200b; inaasar nga ako ng mga kaibigan ko ngayon na under daw ako ng girlfriend ko kaya hindi ako nakikipagkaibigan sa mga babae. pero ayos lang naman sa akin. mas masaya akong tawaging under kaysa naman magkaroon ng mga babaeng kaibigan pagkatapos... &#x200b; rule #5. kapag nagising ka sa madaling araw at nakita si girlfriend na naghahanap ng pagkain at mukhang gutom na gutom, magtago sa closet o kaya'y tumalon sa bintana. nakakatawa itong experience na ito. bakit ba ang mga babae, laging gutom? tapos, kapag pinakain mo masaya na kaagad sila? &#x200b; nagising ako isang beses mga alas-tres 'yata iyon. may narinig kasi akong mga kalampag kaya bumangon ako. wala rin kasi si girlfriend sa tabi ko. sa kusina ko siya nakita, hinahalughog ang ref namin. kaso, hindi pa kami nakakapag-grocery dahil wala pang sahod. &#x200b; tiningnan niya ako, nakakunot ang noo niya. ""gutom na ako,"" sabi niya. kahit gutom, sobrang ganda pa rin niya. kaya hindi ko napansin na tumutulo na pala ang laway niya. &#x200b; siyempre, ayokong nagugutom ang girlfriend ko kaya agad akong tumawag para magpa-deliver. pero, hindi na nakapagpigil pa ang girlfriend ko. sobrang gutom na siya, eh. kaya, ayun! &#x200b; pagkatapos niyang kumain, sobrang saya na niya. &#x200b; anyways, naging maayos naman ang lahat. ngayon, alam ko na ang gagawin kapag nakita siyang ganoon kaya wala naman na kaming naging problema pa. at saka, pwede namang mabuhay na isa lang ang kidney mo, hindi ba? basta't sisiguraduhin ko lang na hindi na ito mauulit pa. nag-iisa na lang ang natitira, eh. &#x200b; oh, napakadali lamang namang tandaan, 'di ba? 'yung ibang girlfriend diyan, napaka-demanding, ang dami-daming gusto, ang dami-daming ayaw. pero girlfriend ko, simple lang. simple pero perfect. kaya napakasaya ko sa kanya, eh. hindi ko na siya papakawalan. at siguradong-sigurado ako na hinding-hindi na niya ako papakawalan. &#x200b; edit: sa mga nagco-comment po at concerned sa akin, huwag po kayong mag-alala. ayos lang po ako. masaya, rewarding, at healthy ang relationship naming dalawa. oo, aaminin ko na medyo underweight ako ngayon nang kaunti (malnourished daw sabi ng doktor pero ano ba namang alam ng doktor? gusto lang akong pagka-perahan 'nun, eh!). medyo napapadalas din akong atakihin ng anemia (although hindi naman ako anemic dati, weird). pero, overall, perfect and happy kaming dalawa. &#x200b; tunay na love ko ang girlfriend ko!!! &#x200b; please subscribe to my pinoy horror animation channel!!! yt: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnaflx-rcdu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnaflx-rcdu)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/oiwuig/perpekto_ang_girlfriend_ko_basta_susundin_mo_lang/,12 07 2021
"alex, tanghaling tapat ng sabado, 2021","(any review for this is very-very much appreciated. i'm an aspiring writer po and i just launched a passion project anthology, isa po ito sa mga kwento) &#x200b; **chairman** ngayon ko lang naranasan ‘to sa tagal ko nang nanunungkulan sa barangay. isama mo na sa mga karanasang ‘yon ang lahat ng away mag-asawa, suntukan ng mga lasing, at mga batang ginagahasa sa bukiran. pero eto… ngayon ko lang napansin na buong araw ko na palang hinihimas ang rosaryong nakasabit sa leeg ko. maya’t-maya ko pa hinahalikan at binubulungan na sana’y wag mangyari sa pamilya ko ang nakita ko kanina. naririnig ko pa rin ang sigaw ni cecil, kumare’t-kapitbahay namin, tanghaling tapat ng sabado, kung saan ang tanghalian sa buong kalsada nami’y naantala dahil sa kanyang nakakakilabot na sigaw. sa ilalim ng nagbabagang init ay nagsitakbuhan kami upang sumaklolo. kinailangan ko pang iwanan ang tinola ni misis at ang isang basong softdrinks na nilalanguyan pa dalawang yelo nang ako’y tumakbo papunta sa bahay ni cecil. ngayo’y hindi pa rin ako kumakain. sa totoo nga’y hindi pa ako nakakaranas ng gutom. hindi ko pa ata kaya. sa bahay ni cecil ay dinatnan namin ang katawan ng panganay ni cecil na si joe na nakaratay sa braso ng kanyang bunsong kapatid na si alex, sa sahig ng kanilang sala. sa leeg ni joe ay nakabaon ang basag na bote na ginamit ni alex na balot na balot sa dugo ng kanyang kapatid. agad ang kapit at halik ko sa aking rosaryo nang makita ko ang imahe; na parang sinaunang obra na naglalahad ng malagim na kwento. pero ano ang kwento neto? hanggang ngayon ay wala pa rin kaming ideya kung bakit. magmula sa pagsigaw ni cecil ng, “anong nangyari?! anak, anong nangyari?!” sa tulalang alex na nakatitig sa dilat na mga mata ni joe, hanggang sa pagpunta namin dito sa aking opisina sa barangay, ay wala pa rin kaming makuhang rason mula sa bakit. sa isang maliit na kwarto sa aking opisina’y pinaupo ko muna si alex. tulala at sinusubukang burahin ang dugo sa kanyang mukha gamit ang duguan ring damit n’ya. hinainan ko ng isang bote ng softdrinks at tatlong pandesal mula pa sa agahan namin kanina si alex, na agad namang n’yang kinain ng walang pag-aalinlangan. dito na nagsimulang gumapang ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod. isang kilabot na hindi ko maipaliwanag, habang pinapanood ko si alex na walang awat sa pagkain, habang ako’y hindi ko pa rin magawang matakam sa masarap na lutong nag-aabang sa’kin sa bahay. “alex,” marahan kong sinabi. “ba’t mo ginawa ‘yun?” tumingin lamang sa’kin si alex, patay na mga mata, bibig na mabagal ang nguya. at sa kanyang paglunok ay walang mga salitang bumalik sa’kin. hindi ko alam kung bakit pero bigla kong naalala si jefferson, isang tricycle driver dito sa’min. dalawang taon na ang nakakalipas nang mapatay n’ya ang isang dayo na nakaaway n’ya sa kalsada. nangyari ‘to nang kamuntikan n’yang makasalpukan ang sasakyan ng dayo, at nang nahinto silang dalawa’y nagkasagutan muna sila bago mapikon si jefferson. hinampas n’ya ng bakal na tubo ang dayo. hindi na raw n’ya napigilan dahil sa mga mapanglait na mga salitang tinawag sa kanya. bobo, unggoy, uling, mababa. labing-isang beses paulit-ulit na hinampas ni jefferson sa ulo ang dayo, at sa sobrang lakas ng bawat hampas ay may parte na ng utak na lumabas dito. sa prisinto’y naalala ko si jefferson, iyak nang iyak at humihingi ng tawad dahil sa nangyari. hindi makakain, hindi rin makatulog. nilamon na s’ya ng konsensya n’ya, at ang konsensya n’ya ang tumulak sa kanya na agawin ang baril ng isa sa mga pulis na nagbabantay, at iputok sa kanyang sariling ulo. nasaktan si jefferson, nagalit, at di nakapagpigil. naintindihan ko ang kwento ‘nun. pero bakit hindi ko maintindihan ‘to? alam kong magkasundo ang magkapatid na ‘to. alam ko kung ga’no sila kalapit sa isa’t-isa. kaya pa’no nangyari ‘to? ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod ay gumagapang paakyat hanggang sa aking dibdib, tila ba kumakapit ng mahigpit. pasikip nang pasikip at medyo nahihirapan akong huminga. ang kakaibang pakiramdam na ‘to’y tumitindi habang nanatiling tahimik at nakatitig lamang sa’kin si alex. biglang iniabot ni alex ang kanyang kamay at dito tumalon na ang puso ko. napaatras ako sa aking kinauupuan, at mabilisan kong hinugot ang aking rosaryo mula sa pagkakatago nito sa aking damit. itinutok ko ito kay alex, na walang ibang kibo kun’di ang kunin ang bote ng softdrinks na nasa harapan n’ya. mas bumilis pa ang pagkatok sa aking dibdib, na para bang kamuntikan na kong mamatay. habang si alex nama’y pinapanood lang ako habang patuloy ang kanyang pag-inom. wala nga ata talagang mangyayari, at nang maramdaman ko kung gaano katahimik ang kwarto’y kumalma na ako. bakit sa dulo ng utak ko’y hinihiling ko na may sapi o di kaya’y isang demonyo talaga ang kaharap ko, at sa presensya ng aking rosaryo’y masasaktan s’ya. kahit anong kakaiba. kahit ano basta magkaroon lang ng eksplenasyon ang nangyari. pero siguro’y kakaiba na rin ang ikinikilos ng bata. at siguro nga’y mas dapat talaga akong matakot sa buhay kaysa sa patay. **cecil** “saan ba ko nagkulang?” tanong ni aling cecil sa mga kumare n’yang nakapalibot sa kanya sa masikip na opisina ni chairmain. napapaligiran din s’ya ng makukulay na mga pamaypay na hindi sabay-sabay ang pagaspas sa harap n’ya; nilulunod si aling cecil sa hangin. ang kanyang mukha nama’y tila ba isang rebulto ng santo kung punas-punasan ng mga panyo. “hindi ko pa rin maintindihan,” dugtong n’ya. “hindi naman ako nagkulang sa aruga. pareho ko namang pinapakita sa kanila na pantay ang pagmamahal ko sa kanila.” tuyo na ang mga mata ni aling cecil, ngunit tila ba hindi pa rin tapos ang kanyang pag-iyak. “hindi sila nag-aaway. hindi ko man lang narinig na nagtalo silang dalawa. o kung may pagtatalo man, malamang sa malamang maliit na bagay lang ‘yun. hindi yung ikakamatay mo!” isang labi ng lumapit sa tenga ni aling cecil, “alam mo tingin ko, baka inggit ‘yan. kasi si joe lang may trabaho sa kanilang dalawa, di ba? tapos si alex, wala pa rin sa kolehiyo. nag-aaral pa rin. sigurado akong ‘yun ang dahilan.” isa pang labi ang lumapit sa kabilang tenga naman ni aling cecil, “baka napikon na. kasi di ba halos s’ya na sa lahat ng gawaing bahay? baka pakiramdam n’ya porke’t mas malaki ambag ng kapatid n’ya , alila na s’ya neto.” isang labi naman na kaharap ni aling cecil ang nagsabing, “baka nagbabait-baitan lang kasi nga si joe ang halos sumasalo sa mga bayarin, pati sa pag-aaral n’ya. pero galit talaga s’ya, kasi baka naman may pagkakataong mas nabibigyang-atensyon si joe kahit hindi n’yo napapansin. kasi halimbawa uuwi s’yang pagod galing sa trabaho, syempre di n’yo maiwasang alagaan, pagsilbihan.” sa gitna ng mga labing ito’y si aling cecil, at ang ideyang unti-unting nabubuo dahil sa mga sinasabi ng mga labi sa kanya. “siguro,” sabi n’ya. “siguro nga.” **abbie** ang pangalan n’ya’y abbie. social worker daw s’ya. pagpasok n’ya’y agad bumungad sa’kin ang asul na bra sa ilalim ng dilaw na blouse nang tapatan ito ng liwanag mula sa bintanang katabi ko. sa kanyang pagtali ng buhok ay nakita kong basang-basa na ang kanyang kili-kili at kumikinang na sa pawis ang kanyang leeg. “alex?” sabi n’ya habang maya’t-mayang tinutulak ng kanyang daliri ang salamin n’yang dumudulas sa kanyang matangos na ilong. “bakit di mo ikwento muna sa’kin ang nangyari bago tayo umalis dito?” pasensya ka na, abbie. hindi ko nagawang sabihin kay chairman, na kilala pa mandin namin. hinding-hindi ko rin masasabi sa’yo. walang ibang maglalahad ng nangyari kun’di ang mga taong nais magbigay kahulugan dito, kasi kung ako tatanungin kung bakit, sa totoo lang, hindi ko rin alam ang isasagot. may nabasag akong bote sa kusina kanina, at sa pagpulot ko nito’y pumasok sa isip ko ang isang udyok. yung tipo ng udyok kapag nasa mataas kang lugar, at bigla mo na lang gustong itulak ang kasama mo. pero alam mong hindi ito dapat gawin, at kakapit ka pa nang mas mahigpit sa kanila para masiguro mong hindi ito mangyayari. ang udyok na ito’y nagsabi sa’kin na isaksak ko kay kuya ang basag na bote. at nalaman ko na lang na totoo na pala ang lahat nang dumapo sa aking balat ang mainit na dugo ni kuya. nahinto lang ako nang maramdaman ko ang buto sa leeg n’ya at nang marinig kong nabibilaukan na s’ya sa kanyang sariling dugo. hindi ko pa rin alam kung bakit. sana, tulad ng iniisip ni chairman, ay nasapian na nga lang ako. pero nakita ko ang lahat, andun ako. hindi ko lang alam na totoo pala ang lahat. namatay si kuya joe sa wala. at hindi ko matanggap na wala. normal lang sana ang sabado namin. tahimik. nanonood lang si kuya ng tv, naglilinis ako sa kusina. si nanay nama’y namamalengke ng pananghalian namin. bicol express daw ang lulutuin n’ya. puta, sinira ko ang araw. gusto kong umiyak dahil hindi na kami babalik sa salo-salo namin. “alex?” muling tawag ni abbie. “gusto kong malaman kung bakit. tayong dalawa lang. kaibigan mo ko dito. hinding-hindi ko ‘to sasabihin sa nanay mo, sa mga kapitbahay n’yo. may mga naririnig ako sa labas na dahil daw sa inggit? totoo ba ‘to? sa inggit nga? magmula nang dinala ako ni chairman dito sa maliit na kwartong ito’y napagpasyahan kong manahimik na lang sa nangyari. sa ngayo’y nilalabanan ko ang mga luha, nilalabanan ko ang panginginig ng aking bibig, at ang mga salitang gustong lumabas mula sa’kin. dapat mukhang hindi ko pinagsisisihan. dapat mukha akong galit. para naman mabigyang halaga, mabigyan ng ibig-sabihin ang pagkamatay ni kuya joe. dapat tinatatak ko sa utak ko na dapat lang! dapat lang sa kanya ang nangyari. dapat hindi ako bibigay. dahil kapag natalo ako, mamatay talaga sa wala si kuya. “sige, kung ayaw mong magkwento, ako muna. kasi naalala ko ‘tong isang batang babae at ang tatay n’yang abusado. tatay n’yang lasinggero. tatay n’yang isang beses s’yang hinipuan sa kanyang sariling kwarto at pinilit. ampon ang batang ‘yon, at tatay-tatayan n’ya lang etong umaabuso sa kanya. takot na takot ang bata dahil pakiramdam n’ya isang gabi’y papatayin na lang s’ya bigla neto. kaya naman isang gabi, nang bigla s’yang pinuntahan ng kanyang tatay upang pagsamantalahan ulit, sinasaksak ito ng bata gamit ang lapis sa mata, sa leeg, at sa dibdib.” kumuha ng panyo si abbie. sa kanyang paggalaw ay muling sumisilip ang kanyang bra sa likod ng blouse na parang mga batang naglalaro sa likod ng kurtina. “masarap sa pakiramdam, pero pumapatay pa rin s’ya ng tao. ilan taon n’yang dinibdib ‘yun. hanggang ngayon nararamdaman pa rin n’ya ang mga kamay ng tatay n’ya sa kanyang ari. sa kanyang dibdib. ilang taon bago n’ya matanggap ang ginawa n’ya. ngayon, medyo mahirap pa ring ikwento, pero kahit papaano’y kaya ko na. nangyari na kasi.” para bang may sumuntok sa aking dibdib nang marinig ko ‘to. bigla kong tinanggal ang aking paningin sa kanyang bra, at sa paggalaw ng aking mga mata’y bigla kong naramdaman ang pamumuo ng mga luha. “ayos lang, alex. pero andito lang ako. aalagaan ka muna namin. tapos pag handa ka na, makikinig ako. kahit pakonte-konte pa, ayos lang. aantayin kong mabuo ang kwento mo.” bumibilis bigla ang tibok ng puso ko. lalong nanginginig ang aking labi. at biglang pumasok si kuya sa isip ko, tumatakbo papalayo sa akin. mga bata pa kami, at hinahabol ko s’ya. “alex?” kuya wag kang lumayo! “alex?” kuya dito ka lang! kailangan kita dito! “sige, ayusin na natin pag-alis mo.” at parang isang batang nadapa sa semento, dito na walang awat na tumulo ang luha sa aking mga mata. “alex?” “hindi ko rin alam… hindi… ko rin alam. sorry, kuya! sorry! hindi ko rin alam kung bakit! patayin n’yo na lang ako! hindi ko alam anong nangyari! hindi ko na kaya!” lumalabo na ang aking paningin, pero kahit ga’no kalabo ang aking mga mata’y kitang-kita ko ang gulat at takot sa mukha ni abbie. pasensya ka na, kuya.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/nlygsa/alex_tanghaling_tapat_ng_sabado_2021/,27 05 2021

"Ayoko na, pagod na ako.","sobrang gulo ng isip ko. kakagraduate ko lang noong june 5 until now wala pa rin akong mahanap na work. alam ko na at fault din ako kasi 3 lang yung inapplyan ko, pero lately, nawawalan talaga ako ng gana mag-apply. hindi ko mafigure out kung ano yung gusto kong gawin. mga 2nd week ng june, nagtry ako maging ugc creator, failed. recently naman (last week), nagtry ako mag luto ng almusal dito sa amin. kumikita naman kaso pa-100 lang. hindi sapat to cover our living expenses. take note, naka partial live in ako sa boyfriend ko, wala siyang work pero may diskarte siya na easy money kaso yung huling success niya sa diskarte na yun ay noong may 30 pa before ako mag graduation kasi supposedly para sa panghanda ko yung money na yun, although naubos lang din and kinakailangan niya mag sanla ulit para makapag bigay sa graduation ko (na hindi ko naman pinilit). i appreciate it tho kaso recently nasusumbat niya sakin yun. minsan nasasabihan niya ako na wala akong kwenta kasi wala akong pera/wala akong work. i feel like a burden to him, altho wala naman siya masyadong financial problem bukod sa naka sanla lang yung alahas niya at tutubo na this month (yung pangalawang reason bakit nakapag sanla ulit siya ng alahas dahil nangutang ako 2k sa kaniya to do ugc, kaso sinanla niya ng parang 7k o 8k so siya rin nakaubos in short). while ako naman, unemployed pero everyday nakakapag provide ako ng food namin, ako rin nagbabayad ng bills, etc. since last year siguro ako nagshoshoulder ng bills, pero lagi niya sinasabi na hinahatian daw niya ako kahit hindi naman. anyway, so yun na nga nagtitinda ako ng almusal, nagtitiis ako in short. i know that there are a lot of opportunities out there pero nacacalm ako kapag nagluluto ako. altho naprepressure ako kasi parang lahat ng tao dito minamadali ako magkawork especially yung boyfriend ko. today, nakapag tinda ako ng almusal kaso hindi naubos. another incident ng kapalpakan ko, yung requirements na ginawa ko para sa diskarte niya, may mali. sobrang nagalit na naman siya sakin, in the end pinaalis niya ako sa property namin na tinutuluyan niya at pinauwi niya ako sa bahay namin kasi ayaw niya ako makita dahil sa sobrang inis niya dahil sa kabobohan ko. magkalapit lang ung property namin na tinutuluyan niya at yung bahay namin. right now, i feel like shit. hindi ko alam gagawin. hindi naubos paninda ko, palpak yung nagawa ko na requirements, wala pa tumatanggap sa akin na work, wala na kami pera for tomorrow (kahit for later wala rin), at higit sa lahat baon ako sa utang. gusto ko nalang kunin ako ni lord. hindi ko alam gagawin. i mean sige given na mag appy ako, mag ayos ako, pero tangina parang lugmok na lugmok ako to the point na gusto ko nalang mamatay. madalas si mama palagi rin ako sinisigawan o pinapagalitan, tapos pag may narinig na pagalit o pamumuna yung boyfriend ko galing sa mama ko regarding sa akin, gagatungan pa niya. help please help. i'm so close para uninom ulit ng zonrox or ano pa man. madalas gusto ko nalang saksakin sarili ko kasi puro ako kapalpakan, wala pa kwenta, burden, lahat na!!!!!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/14q5s33/ayoko_na_pagod_na_ako/,4 07 2023

Pa-rant. I really tried pero isa rin ako sa mga pagod na sa radikal na pagmamahal.,"nagsimula akong maging politically aware at vocal shortly after the 2016 elections. since then, madalas na akong magpost about fighting misinformation and fake news at pagcocondemn ng ejks. pati yung thoughts ko sa pagiimprove ng programs ni du30, ineexpress ko. napuna rin ako ng friends ko a few times kasi minsan ang strong ng wording. so binago ko and i made sure na polite and informative lagi yung posts ko at hindi divisive (hindi ko ginagamit yung dds na label kahit ang tempting). so nung 2019 election, sobrang lungkot ko talaga nung nanalo si bato at bong go. may nakipagbardagulan pa sakin nun but i stood my ground and calmly explained my views. inisip ko na lang, kasalanan lang to lahat ng propaganda machine ni du30. maraming nabiktima. after nun, tuloy tuloy pa rin ako sa pagiging vocal hanggang nung first few months ng pandemic. nung inannounce ni leni na tatakbo siyang president, mas nagresearch pa ako tungkol sa kanya kahit alam ko naman na competent siya. ininterview ko rin yung friends ko about their thoughts sa candidacy niya. dahil sa lahat ng yun, early april ko na nabuhay ulit ang fb ko at nagstart na ako magpost at mangampanya para sa kanya. positive and informative campaigning lang yung naging approach ko. posts about leni's track record and platform, posts about identifying and fighting misinformation and fake news, posts about kakampink art, songs, and rallies. no shade or mention of her opponents at all. i checked all my posts and the attached infographics several times before sharing para sure ako na factual, madaling intindihin, engaging basahin, inclusive, at hindi toxic or elitist yung tone. main target ko ay yung mga kawork ko at family members and relatives ko na class c, d, e na ayaw kay leni kasi exposed talaga sa fake news. and yet, here we are. sobrang disappointed ako ngayon (at indifferent na rin). 2019 feels all over again. maliit lang yung boses ko at alam ko na uphill battle, pero nandun talaga yung hope ko na baka ma-plant ko sa kanila yung seeds of doubt towards fake news peddlers at leni detractors. hindi nagwork, apparently, kahit na nag-iinteract positively yung ilan sa kanila with my posts. bbm sila till the end. maraming toxic kakampinks pero sorry, naniniwala talaga ako na marami pa ring magbubulag-bulagan na bbm supporters kahit pa maging polite ang kakampinks at i-present sa kanila nang maayos ang facts. another proof na yung call nila for positive campaigning is just bs. they've made their choice a long time ago and it was solely based on pride. hindi sila nag-effort, pinili nilang maging tanga. ayoko na.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/umfjyv/parant_i_really_tried_pero_isa_rin_ako_sa_mga/,10 05 2022

Some jeepney drivers don’t deserve their license.,"meron talagang mga jeepney drivers na mae-encounter ka na mapapaisip ka nalang, “paano kaya nakakuha ng lisensya to?”. sunod-sunod na traffic violations, mainit ang ulo na idadamay pa yung mga inosenteng pasahero, di nagbibigay ng sukli, etc. i don’t want this post na maging anti-poor. i know all of them just want to make a living and provide for their families but that doesn’t mean naman na they can just be reckless sa road, right? when you’re driving, especially a public vehicle, hindi lang life mo ang at risk, mga pasahero mo rin. last friday i encountered this extremely rude jeepney driver along alabang-zapote road. just to be clear hindi ako yung sinungitan nya but other pasahero pero i feel really bad for them because isipin mo sobrang init na ng panahon and pagod ka from work or school tapos ganyan pa ugali ng jeepney driver na masasakyan mo. like this one guy said “sa tabi lang po” and i’m guessing he assumed that the driver didn’t hear what he said so the pasahero said “para po” ng 2 times pa ulit. the driver got mad and shouted “sa susunod nga na nagmamadali kayo bumili kayo ng sarili nyong sasakyan ha”. nasa tabi ng driver ako nakaupo nun so rinig na rinig ko talaga and i was shookt. then meron pa na may nakasabay sya sa kabilang lane na friend nyang jeepney driver din and nag kwentuhan sila habang nag d-drive ng sobrang bagal it was causing traffic na sa likod, one driver behind him talagang nag b-beep na sa kanila and this caused him to explode again and shouted “putang ina mo kanina ka pa busina nang busina ha”. tapos one person said “para po” pero this time di talaga narinig ng driver kaya napahinto sya sa may bandang intersection and he got pissed again and shouted about how filipinos are pasaway daw and stuff na bakit ngayon lang daw bababa. gosh, the amount of times i rolled my eyes during the byahe talaga. then the driver stopped suddenly and said sa lahat ng pasahero “wala bang bababa dyan?” then no one responded but i noticed this one student slightly leaning forward to get a clear view of the road ahead, obvious naman na bababa sya malapit na. the driver ignored this and exclaimed “wala na bababa dyan ng alanganin ha” sabay harurot ng sobrang bilis, completely ignoring the poor student saying “para po” and di tumigil hanggang di nakarating sa next stop light. after that thing talaga i realized di ko na kaya tagalan yung driver na yun, bumababa nalang ako nung medyo malapit na sa destination ko. when i looked back pa nga i saw na he parked his jeepney na sa side ng road and got off, habang meron pang pasahero sa loob. he just decided that’s the end of his byahe and wala na magagawa yung ibang pasahero but bumaba nalang kahit malayo pa ang destination nila. buong byahe rin bigla bigla syang sumisingit sa ibang lane, nag overflow, di nag si-signal, etc. i was scared for my life. sorry for the long rant. this really just pissed me off. there’s so many things i wish i’ve done like take a picture of his plate number and file a report to ltfrb pero di ko rin nagawa because i was also slightly bothered by the thought na baka magalit sya sa akin if i even dare take a picture of his jeepney.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/17deymr/some_jeepney_drivers_dont_deserve_their_license/,21 10 2023

Losing friends bc of politics,"i might get downvoted for this but i just rly can’t stand ppl who support bbm and i’ve reached the point where i’m willing to cut ties. i’m surrounded by apologists (both family and friends). i’m from leyte btw, which explains a lot. nalulungkot ako kasi these were my best friends during senior high (we’re in different college universities now). we basically did everything together, studied & got good grades, shared secrets & packed lunches, sneaked out, laughed, cried, even promised to be there at each other’s weddings. we were each other’s support system, and now i’m not so sure anymore. i admit it’s partly my fault because i tend to share a lot of political posts and memes on my account, to the point na nagiging offensive na sa kanila. in my defense, my posts are always based on the truth, but they think it’s all “paninira” and “negative campaigning.” according to them, we should just respect each other’s opinions. one of them also stated that studying in up does not equate to that person being smarter than others who don’t, kasi sa attitude pa rin daw nagmamatter lahat—how you treat and respect people despite their political beliefs. syempre, natamaan ako kasi i’m the only one in our inner circle who entered up. i try to be understanding naman, but sometimes i just lose my shit especially whenever someone redtags me or makes fun of leni sa posts ko, or worst, invalidates the sufferings of martial law victims. this has been going on since the start of the pandemic kasi i was vocal against du30’s pandemic response, in which they implied na puro lang daw ako reklamo. i even got in a heated argument with one of them sa isang post ko which is why dumistansya muna ako. last feb, naging okay ulit kami because i invited them over for my birthday. nag-initiate din ako na walang magtotopic ng politics just so we could just chill and enjoy the day. ngayon, bumabalik nanaman kami sa parinigan via shared posts. di ako nakakapaniwala na they choose to be blind until now. naiinis ako kasi they have the access to information naman, and i believe that it’s every citizen’s responsibility to be socially and politically aware. idk what to do anymore. am i selfish for wanting a different environment? pagod na pagod na ako, walang nakakaintindi sa akin. pati parents ko, dinidismiss lang mga sinasabi ko. ilang araw na akong bigla nalang naiiyak esp with the fact that leni didn’t win + the fear of my future as a comm student in up hahahuhu pls adopt me",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/uof7ge/losing_friends_bc_of_politics/,13 05 2022

Is this a common practice by some if not all doctors?,"i don't know if ito ang tamang lugar to post this at naghihingi na ako ng tawad in advance sa moderator kung hindi. my father was admitted in a private hospital 2 tuesdays ago and got discharged just yesterday at 6 pm. 3 doctors were attending him since he had a major operstion. 2 of the doctors had already given their permission in the morning that we can check out already. the nurse told us that they were just waiting for the other doctor to give a go signal and send his doctor's fee charge. that was 10 in morning. to give him a benefit of a doubt, maybe he was very busy. we waited for hours until finally at 4:30 pm the one incharge in the billing station told me that i had to go to another hospital building to pay for that doctor's fee and look for his secretary. medyo nagtaka at nagworry na ako kasi i wanted it to be included na sana sa bill sa hospital para macover ng senior citizen and philhealth pero sige lang naisip ko baka dun eh ihonor parin nila ang senior discount. i arrived at the other hospital almost 5 pm na. i was medyo worried kasi baka gabi na makalabas ang papa ko at mahihirapan na kaming makauwi. (he got his leg amputated.) when i was about to pay, the secretary told me that they will only release a temporary receipt and mind you, i'm paying 15k. i asked her why and insisted that i want an or and also asked her if ma cover sya ng senior citizen. she called up the doctor, in front of me they talked for awhile and this was what the doctor said. the or daw was with him (sa pagkakaalam ko yung secretary dapat ang mag hawak nun pero baka mali lang ako) and he cannot release and that time kasi he was somewhere else and if i want babalikan ko na lang daw next time which was a hassle for me na. and then discounted na daw yun. dahil sobrang pagod na ako at gusto kong makauwi nayung father ko before mag gabi i accepted it na lang as it is pero at the back of my mind i was really bothered by their practice. yung sa akin kasi, sana dinaan na lang nila yung fee sa hospital para wala na kaming mga tanong at duda pa at kahit sobra pa sa 15k ang babayaran namin ng doctor's fee nya at least we know the official amount. yun lang. thank you. edit: deleted letters and added words.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/14ryegx/is_this_a_common_practice_by_some_if_not_all/,6 07 2023

My mother's current situation at St. Lukes.,"i really need to ask for everyone's insight/recommendations in this subreddit kasi hindi ko na talaga alam ang gagawin ko sa sitwasyon namin ngaun. initially kasi, ung kapitbahay namin kinumbinse ang mama ko na may diabetes na magpacheck up sa st. lukes kasi wala daw silang binayaran sa pagpapatingin at opera sa kanya dahil may maxicare sya. ako naman pumayag kasi dependent ko si mama sa hmo ko sa work at malaking tulong nga talaga ung walang babayaran. aside from that, naging masama na talaga ung nararamdaman ni mama at gusto na nya magpatingin dahil may sugat sya sa hinliliit nya sa paa at un ang nagcacause ng panghihina nya. fast forward anduon na kami sa office ng doctor at nung pagkakita nya sa paa ng mama ko, minadali na nya kaming ipa admit ang mama ko (note na wala talaga ako masyadong alam about confinement at nataranta na rin ako kaya pumayag na ako ipa admit sya sa st lukes). fast forward ng dalawang araw at naka schedule na si mama for operation sa kanyang paa. kinabukasan ininspect ng surgeon ung paa at merong parts na naging necrotic. minessage ako ng pinsan ko kasi nalaman nya ung nangyari kay mama at ininform ko sa kanya na may confidence pa nga na wala naman kaming babayaran kasi may hmo si mama pero inutusan nya ako na magparunning bill (hindi ko nga alam tong term na ito eh dahil wala talaga akong knowledge about hospitalization). inexplain nya na gawin ko daw un or else magugulat na lang ako sa bill namin. kinabukasan dimiretso ako sa billing department ng hospital at nag request ng soa at putangina nagulat ako dahil sa tatlong araw ng pag stay ni mama sa ospital 300k+ na agad ung bill! natulala ako nun for a good minute at dumiretso ako sa maxicare para magask ng options (kung pwede ipaincrease ung limit or kung pwede ipatong ung limit ko sa limit ng mama ko) pero negative. fast forward sa 2nd operation ni mama at kinabukasan ininspect ulit at may parts ulit na necrotic at duon na kami binigyan ng option na putulin ung paa nya. ang kinaiinis ko pa dito bakit hindi na lang nila inadvise na iamputate in the first place (although ayaw ko naman mangyari un dahil napaka morbid) pero sinabi naman nila na ayaw nila mapunta sa pagputol at itry na isave ung paa as much as possible. i get that pero wala kaming financial capacity na sagutin ung bill. ang intention ko lang naman is mapatingin sya at magkaroon ng mabilis na operation na macocover ng hmo nya pero hindi un ang naging case. fast forward sa present, nakausap ko na ung doctor at sinabi ko na nakapagdecide na kami ng mama ko na putulin na lang ung paa nya para hindi na kumalat pa ung impeksyon at dahil 800k na ung tanginang bill namin. kaya ito ako ngaun humihingi ng recommendation/advice kung anong pwedeng gawin in case hindi masolusyunan ng medical assistance sa government/politicians. base sa mga research ko against the law na magdetain ng patients due to non payment. pero ang magiging loophole nila samin ay ang room namin initially ay private kasi ayun ang sabi ng maxicare na covered nila at wala naman sa isip ko na ilagay kami sa ward dahil mahina ang diskarte ko sa hospital. **tl;dr** ang ineexpect kong free of charge appoinment sa st. lukes ay napunta sa malaginto na bayarin kaya nanghihingi ako ng advice kung ano pwedeng gawin para hindi makulong ang nanay ko sa ospital dahil wala kami pambayad sa bill. edit: nasa ward naman na kami ngaun kaya sana bigyan kami ng consideration despite admitting in a private room initially na inoffer ng maxicare. ***update*** nakausap ko na ung sa billing may pinagusapan kaming options. ang ayaw ko lang naman talaga kasi na mangyari eh idetain kami dito sa hospital dahil hindi kami makakabayad in full. payag naman ako sa installment plan pero wala daw ganung option. sinabi ko naman ung storya ko na napaagree lang naman kami sa st lukes dahil inassure ng kapitbahay na wala naman kaming gagastusin and kasi akala ko saglit lang si mama duon at simple lang ung operation pero nagtagal sya at lumobo na ung bill. i expected na macocover lahat ng charges gamit ung hmo ng mama ko pero hindi pala. so ayun tinanong nya sakin na kinonsider ko daw ba na lumipat sa ibang hospital. sinabi ko nasa isip ko naman un pero ano ba ung magiging process? kailangan ba bayaran muna ung bill dito bago malipat? wala syang dinisclose duon kasi ung management nya lang daw ung makakapag decide. so nung narinig ko un medj gumaan ung loob ko dahil parang may loophole. so tinanong ko ano po ba ung magiging repercussions kapag lumipat ako ng hospital at hindi ko mababayaran ung bill sa st lukes which is hindi naman talaga kaya. sabi nya possible na mangyari is ma-ban kami sa st lukes. edi ok lang. wala naman talaga kami mababayad kahit pigain nila kami at kahit anong gagawin nilang pagdetain samin lolobo lang ung amount ng bill na hindi namin mababayaran. kaya kung i restrict/ban nila kami due to non payment edi go. hindi ko naman ginusto na pumunta sa st lukes balak ko naman talaga is sa pgh or kahit anong government hospital. sadyang nakumbinse lang ng kapitbahay.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/y1b76n/my_mothers_current_situation_at_st_lukes/,11 10 2022

Dapat talaga maging legal na ang divorce sa Pilipinas.,"last year, my aunt's partner of eight years died from sudden cardiac arrest. now, here's the real problem: my step-uncle is married to another woman. no, hindi kabit si tita. separated sila because the legal wife is a cheater. nabuntis ng kuya nung step-uncle ko. now, si tito, gustong magpa-annull pero there's no valid cause and it's freaking expensive pa. so, imagine kung ano-ano ang mga nagpapahirap ngayon sa loob ni tita: \- wala siyang karapatan sa katawan ni tito. ni hindi man lang niya nakita ang katawan bago ni-cremate. \- nasa abroad si tito until three years ago. noong naging sila, nagpundar si tito ng negosyo (palaisdaan) at si tita ang nagpalago noon. syempre, dugo at pawis ni tita ang puhunan pero wala, di rin siya entitled dito. \- pinaalis na si tita sa bahay ni tito. at ang titira doon ay ang legal wife pati yung tarantadong kapatid. \- worst: parehong si legal wife at kapatid ang makikinabang sa lahat ng pera ni tito. at ngayon, walang pera si tita. ni hindi man lang siya hinire sa palaisdaan because the bitchy legal wife wants nothing to do with her. nakakagalit lang. imagine, kumerengkeng siya tapos ngayon, sarap buhay sila sa pera ng niloko niya? guys, this is why i support and will always support divorce. di ko naman kinakailangang manggaling sa problematic na pamilya para ma-realize na mayroong taong deserve na makalaya dito. to all religious bastards who still don't see the problem here, fuck you and your sense of entitlement. hindi ka dadalhin sa langit ng pagiging self-righteous mo.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/mqk8na/dapat_talaga_maging_legal_na_ang_divorce_sa/,14 04 2021
What does Albularyo do (witch doctor/folk healer)? Do they really do something? May naniniwala pa ba sa kanila in this generation?,"so i have a brother, he's 25 year old. we rushed him twice in the hospital this week. pero prior pa sa mga episodes na'to, he's feeling symptoms already eg. tightness of chest, nagka-cramps ang katawan niya, difficulty sleeping, nahihirapan huminga, etc. after all the medical exams, okay naman lahat ng results niya, normal lahat ng test. a friend of his advised him to go to albularyo (which i am against kasi i think he's having mental health problems talaga which affects he's overall being since yung mga symptoms niya ay linked to anxiety and depression eg. panic attacks/difficulty breathing). but i just let them para sa peace of mind na rin na atleast we all did everything possible kahit na talagang kapos kami, we just don't want him to feel na pinapabayaan namin siya. so fastforward kung saan pumunta yung albularyo sa bahay, wala naman siyang masyadong ginawa. may sinabi na may lumalaro raw sa kapatid ko (nangkukulam daw sa kanya), mas marami pa actually yung pagboboast niya na he's done something for someone, na siya yung reason kung bakit nalaman kung sino yung kumuha sa wallet ng isa niyang pasyente (?). he's just engaging us in the conversation. he also said na yung mga ibibigay niyang papakuluan at iinumin ay exported pa raw and such. and to my surprise p4000 lahat yung siningil niya for that session only. he's not the typical albularyo rin, naka-car siya and mukha namang well-off. do you think reasonable yun as bayad? i mean, may mga naririnig naman na akong albularyo before pero usually hindi ganun kalaki ang hinihingi nila. since parang act of altruism yon in their part since meron silang god-given gift. i don't have anything against sa mga albularyo or naniniwala/nagpeperform nga mga ganoong rituals pero i felt robbed for me and sa kuya ko kasi we chipped in sa bayad. malaking bagay na yon para samin, he's living paycheck to paycheck and i'm still reviewing for my boards so big deal talaga yun sakin. and if ever may magtanong kung bakit hindi ko na lang sinuggest na magvisit ng psychologist. it is still not acknowledge sa amin, especially sa pamilya namin. and simply not accessible. (how can i put it into words) parang still stuck sa phase na ""nasa isip mo lang yan."" bottomline, are albularyos a thing? am i just overreacting sa bayad? edit: i'm reading all your comments guys and i really appreciate them. pero hindi ko lahat ma-process right now kasi my manung just talked to the albularyo, and he's asking him 5k kasi may ritual daw silang gagawin bukas and he's gonna bathe him with god knows what and how, at hindi pa sure kung yun na yung last na hihingin niya. and he assured him daw na 'pag 'di gumaling, ibabalik daw yung binayad. i really can't process anything right now kasi i'm thinking na baka this is only the beginning nung mga paghingi hingi niya, and knowing my brother he really won't listen to any of us. edit: please don't share this with any platform update: i took your advice guys and told him na he should instead see a therapist since malaking bagay yung hinihinging 5k. i also forwarded informative videos na very similar sa mga symptoms na nafifeel niya na linked to anxiety. unfortunately, umutang daw siya ng pambayad and binayaran na niya. and he won't acknowledge yung idea na maybe he has anxiety. sobrang close minded niya with regards doon. i'll just hope and pray for the placebo effect.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/17nhpid/what_does_albularyo_do_witch_doctorfolk_healer_do/,4 11 2023
Paano kayo nagccope up sa pagkawala ng mahal ninyo sa buhay?,"it's been 2 weeks since my father died. sobrang bilis, ang lakas niya pa lang tapos bigla na lang siyang nastroke. sabi ng doctor niya makakauwi na siya, pero yung day na dapat uuwi na siya ang day ng libing niya. hanggang ngayon, hindi pa rin mawala sa isip ko kung may pagkukulang ang mga doctor ni papa. doctor ni papa na cardiologist ang humawak sa case niya, nadiagnose siya ng hemorrhagic stroke, pumutok ang ugat sa utak niya at kailangan pigilan ang pagkalat ng dugo. sobrang confident namin sa doc ni papa kasi sabi magaling daw, ang sabi after 5 days ic-ct scan ulit si papa. ang lakas ni papa kahit nung 1-2 days niya sa icu. inaalis niya pa ngt sa ilong niya and malikot ang left side niya though hindi niya magalaw ang right side ng katawan niya at hindi namin siya makausap. 3rd day ni papa sa icu, sinabihan siya ng doctor niya na makakalabas na siya ng icu ng thursday (saturday ng madaling araw na stroke si papa at nadala namin siya agad sa ospital). at sabi, saturday makakauwi na siya sa amin. ayan ang advise ng doc niya sa amin bago umalis ang doc ni papa at nagseminar o may pinuntahan sa ibang bansa at iniwan sa isang doc na iternist. that day, nanghina si papa. ang dating malakas na grip na kamay niya at malikot niyang paggalaw ay humina... akala namin okay na... sobrang taranta na namin at late na na may nakapagsabi sa amin na kakilala na bakit walang neurologist si papa. kailangan daw niya neuro. late rin namin nalaman na cardio and internist doctors lang humahawak kay papa. before that, tanong na kami nang tanong sa mga nurses. nagtanong pa kami bakit hindi pa ict-scan si papa dahil nanghina siya. ang sabi, hindi na raw kailangan daw lalabas na siya. binawasan din mga gamot niya. kaso ang sabi nagka-infection daw siya sa dugo dahil hindi mawala ang lagnat niya kay binigyan siya ng antibiotics. thursday nang malaman namin na walang neuro si papa at kailangan niya ng neuro. pinilit namin na ipatingin si papa sa neuro kahit na nagagalit na samin mga nurses. cardio raw ang kailangan ni papa at hindi neuro. pinapirma kami ng waiver na kami ang nag-ask for neuro at hindi ang doctor ni papa. turns out, nang icheck siya ng neuro bakit daw hindi na-ct scan agad. dapat 2-3 days na ct scan daw ulit para malaman kung namaga utak ni papa. mali pa raw ang antibiotics na ibinibigay kay papa, sobrang baba raw dapat daw malakas dahil sa utak nga daw ang problema ni papa. thursday night, bumagsak katawan ni papa. ang gcs niya from 10 nang dinala namin siya sa ospital to 3. kumalat na daw ang dugo sa utak ni papa as per result ng ct scan sabi ng neuro niya baka kailanganin niya ng surgery. that night, sobrang bumaba bp niya, naging abnormal heartbeat niya at super nahirapan siyang huminga nilagyan na siya ng tube. super sakit akala namin makakauwi na siya tapos friday ng madaling araw nawala na siya. super sakit, before siya mastroke pinag-uusapan pa lang namin graduation ko. sabi niya super proud siya sa amin magkakapatid. ngayon hindi na niya ako makikitang ggraduate....yung panganay niya, walang tatay sa graduation. hindi ko alam kung may pagkukulang mga doctors niya or what, until now di pa rin namin nassettle ang bill. ang hirap magsalita kasi di naman kami expert pero para sa akin may pagkukulang sila. hindi ko sila sinisisi pero ang sama-sama ng loob ko!!! may times na parang okay na, pero kapag naaalala ko si papa... ang sakit-sakit, sobrang miss ko na siya. sobrang miss ko na ang papa ko. unang anak niya na mapapagraduate niya ng college, hindi niya makikita... kahit na mahirap, pinag-aaral niya kaming apat. ang sakit-sakit pa rin... hindi ko alam paano magccope up sa pagkawala ni papa...",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/14hwjjn/paano_kayo_nagccope_up_sa_pagkawala_ng_mahal/,24 06 2023

day 2 was memorable in the worst way possible for both of us. the way that the event should play out is that there 10 battles and the flow of the event should be like this: 3 battles -> short break -> 3 battles -> short break -> 2 battles -> short break -> 2 battles. note that the rap battles averaged around 30 mins. each. the last 2 battles are the match between sinio vs apekz that fans have been eagerly waiting for almost 5 years to happen, and the isabuhay 2022 finals between pistolero vs luxuria. specifically, the sinio vs apekz match is the single reason that most fans are attending this event. okay, so the first battle was between g-clown vs jr-zero (great battle btw). when the battle was about to start, electricity went out in the venue. may bumigay ata sa circuit breaker. anygma told us that to wait for about 40 mins to fix the situation. after waiting for about an hour, electricity came back and the first battle was able to start with no further issues. then the second battle started, which is the royal rumble match between sur henyo vs kregga vs batang rebelde vs lil strocks vs bagsik. this is when another problem of the venue has started to rise. the venue by the way is asuncion badminton court in san juan, manila. it has a narrow entryway which is not really a problem for a badminton court. around second battle ay napansin ko na dumami na mga tao sa venue, kahit yung entryway para sa gen ad at vip section ay mapupuno na pati na rin yung 2nd at 3rd floor. halos siksikan na kami sa vip section, at yung partner ko ay umalis na kasi di na raw siya makahinga dahil sa init, hindi siya ganun katangkad compared sa mga ibang tao sa section namin kaya mas ramdam niya ang init. sa case ko naman medyo di na kinaya yung init at nag-alala na sa partner ko ay di ko mabigyan ng full attention ang battle, kaya umalis na rin ako sa vip section at napansin ko na ang dami rin palang gustong umalis dahil sa init. nung nakalabas na ako sa vip section ay sinamahan ko na partner ko sa isang section ng venue na may hangin pa na pumapasok. after matapos yung 2nd battle ay nagkaruon ng mahabang break, may narinig na rin kami sa iba na may nahimatay na rin ibang tao sa crowd. natawa ako sa partner ko nung nag cr siya sa 3rd floor, sabi niya parang nasa bilibid siya dahil sa nakikita niya sa upper floors, mga lalaki nakahubad na mga shirts nila habang naka upo sa railings dahil sa sobrang init. almost 1 hr kami naghintay bago nag announce si anygma na dahil sa critical na sitwasyon namin sa venue ay uunahin na nila yung 3 main event level battles para mabawasan ang mga tao sa venue. the 3 battles are m zhayt vs cripli, pistoleto vs luxuria, and sinio vs apekz. nag stay parin kami ng partner ko sa same section na may hangin pa since rinig naman namin yung mga laban sa speakers. after nung 3 battles ay andami yung nagsi-alisan sa venue, halos 1/4 ng crowd na lang ang natira. around 2 am naka-alis na yung ibang tao sa venue ay kumain muna kami ng partner ko sa food stalls nila, this is also when i used the cr in the 2nd floor for the first time during the event. sabi ng partner ko walang flush yung cr nila sa 3rd floor, sa 2nd floor ganun din pero bruh, may natirang explosion pa sa inidoro tapos ang lawak ng brown puddle ay ma no-choice ka na tumapak dun para maka ihi ka lang. malala rin yung sa 3rd floor nung sinamahan ko partner ko, nasa labas ka palang pero ang tapang ng amoy. i-mention ko na rin na andaming basura sa venue, kulang yung designated trash bags sa venue. sa 2nd at 3rd floor naman wala kang makikita trash bags dun pero daming plastic bottles at beer cans sa tabi tabi. nung nag start na 6th battle between invictus vs fukuda, napansin ko na inaantok na partner ko sa pagod. decided kami na quits na sa event kahit sa gusto naming panuorin yung remaining battles pero halos 10 hrs na kami naka tayo dun sa venue eh hindi na talaga kinaya ng katawan namin ang pagod. tumambay muna kami sa mcdo na malapit sa venue para kumain ulit at maka-idlip saglit ang partner ko bago kami umuwi. so ayun, our fliptop ahon 13 – day 2 experience, aka san juan city jail experience. baka di lang talaga kaya katawan namin na magtagal sa mga ganung events. i feel bad lang sa mga iba na first time nila maka-attend ng fliptop event tapos ganito ang naranasan nila. hopefully anygma and fliptop staff will learn from this. thank you for having the time to read my long post. edit: i thought that half ng crowd ang nawala after the sinio vs apekz battle, but turns out halos 1/4 na lang ang natira upon seeing a pic of the whole venue comparing the crowd before and after their battle.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/zozzn0/my_fliptop_ahon_13_day_2_experience/,18 12 2022
"Why are apolo10s so brave online and ""passionate"" about supporting Jr. online but quickly deny about it when asked in person?","i visited some apolo10s in their workplaces (not sure why many of them ay nakapublic ang workplaces sa fb. isn't that info you normally keep private or visible only to friends?) to ask them face to face what they saw kay jr. and hopefully report their sharing of fake news and libelous statements to opposition candidates and their supporters to their human resources. based on my observations, i've noticed the following - 1. either todo deny sila they voted for bbm or sa mga posts nila (most of which involve fake news, paninira or bardagulan) kahit na i am showing it straight to their faces. i mean kakampinks are proud they voted for atty. leni, so are those who voted for yorme, pacquiao and the other candidates pero most of the apolo10s i meet and know deny jr. parang mga jeepney, taxi, tricycle and grab drivers along with middle-aged people lang ang proud to have voted him in person pero ung mga bata-bata (20's - 30's), todo deny. is it because they realize their mistake na or sadyang nakakahiya lang maging associated with the marcoses, even through the ballots? they've won, shouldn't more of them be proud of it? 2. common reason nila for their posts is nahack, identity theft, hiniram ng friend or relative ung account (do people seriously do this? di ba unsafe ung ganyan), lasing daw nun or sarcasm lang. 3. andaming apolo10s na service crew, blue collars and bpo agents. gets ko na malaki chance mauto ng mga service crew and blue collars due to the lack of decent education for most of them (no offense meant pero that's the stereotype) pero ano kaya nakikita ng mga bpo agents kay jr? same question goes to the highly-educated folks who voted for him. parang karamihan ng mga trolls work in a bpo or restaurant or food kiosk. di naman nila ako masagot kasi like i've said - many of them deny they ever supported or voted jr. 4. most trolls i've met, even those who are related to me and former friends, ay malalaki katawan - either obese or muscular (again, no offense meant, observation ko lang). 5. they consider it foul to report their posts sa employers nila yet before, during and after the elections - todo kalat sila ng fake news, libelous statements and even threats in some cases. as an hr practitioner kasi, if you made your employment public, everything you do or say might reflect sa company mo. i mean, would you really want to be served by someone na nagkakalat ng mga fake news and foul statements or if business owner ka, would you really want to be associated with internet trolls? my fellow kakampinks and even my supervisor, na isko supporter, is currently suggesting i stop doing this due to possible dangers and risks pero i plan to continue doing so - siguro irereport ko na lang sila sa employers nila online or daanan ko na lang pag merong apolo10 na nasa ruta ng fieldworks. nabalot kasi ako ng galit recently, enough for me to gain the strength to confront some of them directly. harap-harapan na kasi tayong ginagawang tanga ng philippine government pero sila todo depensa pa rin dito, kahit na karamihan sa kanila ay nararanasan ung mga shortcomings like our terrible transportation system and inflation and as an hr - pet peeve ko ang wrong choices pagdating sa tao who will be required to do a certain job.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/w2uetk/why_are_apolo10s_so_brave_online_and_passionate/,19 07 2022

Our daily dose of hopium: silent Leni supporters,"may event sa family kung saan may ilang hindi nakadalo. dahil dun sa mga absent na yon, nagkaroon ako ng opportunity makausap nang totohanan yung pinsan kong lalake kung sino talaga iboboto niya. before this, dalawang beses na ako nag-attempt na ikampanya si leni sa mga family members na madalas ko makainuman. both times, either tahimik lang si pinsan or pabiro ang mga sagot (like si rastaman daw iboboto niya). kanina nung kausap ko siya, pabulong niya inamin na ""silent"" daw siya. silent ano? silent bbm? nope. silent leni. ang pinsan kong to, gym rat. malaki ang katawan, yung tipong magdadalawang isip ka bago mo banggain. friendly din siya at magaling makipag-koneksyon. madami siya kaibigan na mga pulis. sabi rin niya, yung mga kaibigan niyang pulis na yon, leni supporters din. aminin ko guys, nabuhayan talaga ako ng loob. sabi niya kasi ayaw lang talaga niya mapaaway dahil sa choice niya, siguro dahil na rin ayaw niya makwestyon yung pride niya bilang maton na lalaki na boboto sa babae. pero aware siya sa mga kakulangan ni babym para magpatakbo ng bansa. binanggit pa nga niya yung smni debate na nagpasaring si clarita carlos dun sa mga hindi umattend ng debate nila. (please help me cite this kasi di ako nanood non.) parang nakalimutan nila na si marcos jr. ang numero unong duwag pagdating sa pakikipag-debate. one last thing na sagot ni insan nung sinabi ko na kaya tayo dapat nanghihikayat pa kasi yung survey gap ang hinahabol, mauulit daw ulit yung nangyari six years ago during the vice presidential election. i do think baseless yung confidence niya na ganun nga ang mangyayari kahit wala tayong ibang gawin, but the thought is at least heartening. p.s. kasama namin sa usapan yung isa ko pang pinsan na undecided daw pero lbm ang asawa. hopefully napaisip man lang namin siya kung hindi outright nakumbinsi mag-leni then and there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/tycnjb/our_daily_dose_of_hopium_silent_leni_supporters/,7 04 2022
Tagalized Story.,"may story ako. ako lang ang nag-iisang babae sa pinag-tatrabahuhan kong kumpanya at alam ko na kung bakit. isa akong fresh graduate sa kolehiyo at gusto ko na talagang makapag-simula ng career agad-agad na walang kinalaman sa pagse-serve ng pagkain, pagpupunas ng mga gamit, o pag-dadala o timpla ng kape sa isang matandang negosyante. sa naka-sanayan nag-aapply ako sa trabaho na may anim na araw na trabaho at marami-rami na rin akong interview na napagdaanan. alam ko na ang tinapos kong hrm na kurso ay hindi gaanong makaka-kuha ng magandang oportunidad, pero naniniwala pa rin ako na may mas maganda pang trabaho na naghihintay sa akin. kaya naman nanatili akong positibo, matyaga, at nag-aapply lang sa mga office jobs na may magandang benipisyo. kahit halos wala na akong mapag-kunan ng makakain dahil sa magastos na mga interview, at least mapapag-tibay naman nito ang kakaunting pride na natitira sa akin. halos tatlong linggo na rin ang nakalipas, may isa akong phone interview sa isang internet security company. ang kumpanyang iyon ay maraming offices sa amin at naghahanap sila ng bagong customer support specialist para sa kanilang international department. ang mga requirements ay maganda o mahinahon na boses, good spoken and written grammar, kakaunting tech-knowledge, at may kakayahang mag-trabaho sa umaga at gabi. ang office ay dalawang sakay lang sa mula sa amin, at mayroon silang magandang offer sa health insurance. nag-aapply ako kahit lmitado lang din ang alam ko sa computer science. naging maayos naman ang phone interview at matapos ang dalawang meetings sa hr at sa management, binigyan nila ako ng isang napaka-gandang offer (kahit na wala pa talaga akong experience sa kahit anong trabaho). sa loob ng unang linggo ko, kailangan kong magtrabaho nang regular shift na 9-5 (am) para maging online ako kasabay ng manager ko, na nag-trabaho sa ibang branch ng kumpanya. pagkatapos noon ay kailangan kong magtrabaho para sa regular na schedule ko bilang support - ang schedule ko ay 6 na araw na pasok (09:00 am -05:00 pm (am) at may isang araw na night shift 09:00 pm - 05:00 am respectively). sa unang araw ko, ang suot ko ay isang loose na sweater at mahabang skirt. bilang sa kaalaman ko ay sa ganitong uri ng trabaho ay karamihan mga lalaki ang empleyado, ayaw ko naman mag-cause ng unnecessary attention dahil sa provocatively o inappropriately pag-susuot ng hindi naayon na attire. ang lalaki sa front desk ay mukha namang maayos na tao. pinakilala n'ya ang sarili n'ya bilang si andrew bago n'ya ako tulungang mag-fill out ng mga paperwork at sinamahan n'ya na ako sa aking mesa at sa isang open space na workspace. nakatitig lang ako sa tila walang katapusang mga desks habang naglalakad kami, napansin ko na halos hindi mo makikita ang mga mukha ng bawat taong nagta-trabaho na naka-upo sa bawat desks. wala man lang akong nakita o napansin na babae habang nag-lalakad kami sa tila baga'y walang katapusang workspace na iyon, na talaga namang hindi normal at nakaka-bahala. kahit ang kalmadong presensya ni andrew ay hindi kayang maiwaglit ang wari kakaibang pakiramdam na naka-tuon sa akin. halos maubusan ako ng hininga ng maramdaman ko ang mga presensya ng bagong kong co-workers na tila nagsasabi na ""hindi ka nababagay dito"". nagulat ako ng biglang huminto si andrew sa isang desk na napuno ng mga printed memes, floral stickers, at isang lumang keychain na naka-patong sa harap ng monitor. bukod pa doon ay natatakpan na rin ng makapal na alikabok ang keyboard, monitor at ang natitirang ispasyo ng desk. ""ahhh... anong nangyari..."" sabi ni andrew sa medyo upset na boses. ""pasensya ka na."" sabi nito habang nakatingin sa aking mga papeles. ""ah... aya. dapat matagal na 'tong nalinis. kailangan kong maka-usap ang custodian"". ""ok lang 'yun"", sagot ko. ""puwede ko namang punasan na lang 'yan, wala namang problema"". medyo asiwa na noon si andrew, pero habang ginagala ko ang aking paningin ay malinaw na wala ng ibang bakanteng desk maliban doon. mabilis na natapos ang araw na iyon. natutunan ko na ang mga dapat kung gawin na sumagot sa support related phone calls at gumawa ng bagong ticket para sa system. kailangan ko ring i-monitor ang lahat ng pumapasok na chats at written tickets at isaayos ito base sa level ng urgency at type nito. hindi naman ako required mag-bigay ng technical advice, pero dapat maging pamilyar ako sa aming product software. bilang wala pa namang mga tawag ay pinaki-alaman ko muna ang manual. halos wala akong maintindihan sa mga naroon kaya naman ginogle ko na lang ang karamihan na nasa manual. kinumusta ako noon ng manager ko at mukhang hindi s'ya masaya sa mga lapses ko sa mga materials. dahil pakiramdam ko wala akong matinong nagawa at gagawin sa mga oras na iyon ay panandalian akong nag-break para linisin ang mesa ko. tumayo ako para tanungin si andrew kung saan makaka-kuha ng basahan para sa mesa ko. agad-agad kong pinagsisihan ang desisyon kong iyon. ang bawat mata sa kwarto ay tila napako sa pagtayo ko sa aking kinauupuan. hindi ako sigurado pero maraming mga bulungan akong narinig habang papalayo ako sa aking mesa. ang kaninang maingay na mga keyboard ay pahina nang pahina na halos kainin na ako ng lupa sa sobrang hindi ko pagiging kumportable at self-conscious na rin at the same time. napansin ko na lang na halos halikan ko na ang dibdib ko sa pagyuko para lang hindi ako mapansin. bago ako maka-rating sa isang palikong daan patungo sa front desk ay buong-lakas kong tinignan ang isang tila walang hiyang lalaki na nakatitig sa akin. hindi ko alam kung ano ang inaasahan ko, pero 'yung overall appearance ng lalaking naka-hooding pang-asar na 'yun ay nagbigay ng matinding kilabot sa buong katawan ko. siguro mga ka-edad ko s'ya pero hindi man lang s'ya nahiya o natinag sa pagkaka-titig n'ya sa akin sa kabila ng pagtitig ko sa kanya na may halong pagka-bwisit at inis. isang kakila-kilabot na ngiti ang sumilaw sa mga labi nito habang naka-titig sa parteng bukong-bukong ng aking mga paa at dahan-dahan itong bumalik sa kanyang monitor. inisip ko kung anong magiging reaksyon n'ya kapag tinitigan ko rin ng kaparehong paraan ng pagtitig n'ya sa akin ang tinitigyawat n'yang leeg. parehong reaksyon pa rin ang nakuha ko habang naglalakad ako pabalik sa aking mesa kasama ang box ng computer wipes sa mga kamay ko. may maganda ring nangyari sa araw na iyon. habang nililinis ko ang mga drawer ng mesa ko ay may nakita akong half-used notebook mula sa nakaraang nagta-trabaho sa mesa ko. hindi n'ya nilagay ang first name n'ya, kundi initial lang at last name: j. espiritu. pero, base sa dekorasyon ng notebook, sigurado ako na babae rin s'ya kagaya ko. ang mga naiwan n'yang gamit ay nagbigay ng kapanatagan sa akin, pero 'yung notebook ang talagang pumukaw ng atensyon ko. doon ay sinabi nito ang pina-ikli at simpleng manual gamit ang easy-to-undertand terms at mga explenasyon sa nakaka-litong terminolohiya at komplikadong panuto sa manual. sa tulong n'ya ay nasurpresa ko ang aking manager sa aking product knowledge pagkatapos ng shift ko. matapos ang isang magandang araw ay buong tapang akong gumala sa office at nag-explore sa pantry. binenta ni andrew sa akin ang top-notch coffee machine at snacks sa nasabing pantry, tutal nagugutom na rin naman ako matapos ang isang emotionally, intellectually and productive na araw na 'yun. (ansabe). tsaka, medyo butas na rin 'yung bulsa at namumula na ang mga credit cards ko, kaya naman ayos na ako sa ilang pirasong masasarap na cookies. habang papalapit ako ay may narinig akong malakas na usapan at tawanan sa pantry. sa katangahan ko ay inisip ko na baka naman mas mainit, friendly o kahit maka-tao na sila sa akin. subalit ang maliit na pantry ay napuno ng katahimikan the moment na pumasok ako sa pantry. may limang lalaki doon na mag-kakaiba ang edad at lalaki na naka-upo sa palibot ng isang maliit na lamesa, at lahat sila ay naka-titig na direkta sa akin. ""panget na araw?"" - tugon ng isang pang-asar na boses. agad kong itinaas ang ulo ko mula sa pagkaka-titig sa sahig para hanapin ang pinag-mulan ng boses. hindi naging mahirap sa aking hanapin at malaman na mula iyon sa naka-hoodie na walang-hiyang tumitig sa akin nung nakaraan lang. ""siguro marami ka ng experience?"" - sambit pa nito sa nakaka-asar na tono at may-unting pag-taas ng kilay. ""para makakuha ng komportableng trabaho. siguro sikat ka?"". ""ano 'to, high-school?"" - sagot ko sa malakas na boses. hindi ko hilig kumompronta ng tao, pero sobra na 'to. hostility is one thing, social awkwardness is another, pero pakiramdam ko isa 'tong 80's na high-school drama na mga trenta anyos ang mga bida bilang mga teenagers. ""nandito lang ako para kumuha kape at kung may problema ka sa trabaho ko, puwede mong dalhin sa hr kung ano man ang issue mo"". nagpatuloy ako habang ine-enjoy ang namumutla at pahiyang mukha ng mga taong 'yun. mabuti naman, gusto kong maramdaman nila ang katiting na discomfort na buong araw kung kinakaharap. pinili kong lumayo sa aking mga co-workers, naglakad ako ng taas noo pabalik sa mesa ko na may hawak-hawak na tasa ng kape. bago pa ako maka-upo at enjoyin ang masarap na kape, napansin kong may isang mensahe galing sa hindi kilalang number: ""you have quite an attitude, don't you?"" nanigas ako habang hawak ang cell phone sa isa kong kamay at kape sa kabila. habang prino-proseso ko ang tila breach sa personal security ko, naka-tanggap ulit ako ng dalawa pang mensahe. isa ay ang hubo't-hubad kong katawan na sinend ko sa una kong serious college boyfriend. ang pangalawa: ""bakit hindi mo ngayon ibigay 'yang picture sa hr?"" sa totoo lang, sobrang naapektuhan ako sa invasion ng privacy ko. pumasok ang kahihiyan sa akin at sobrang naiinis ako for drawing so much unwanted attention sa sarili ko. kasalanan ko lahat 'to. pumasok ako sa isang office na puno ng ethical hackers na may pare-parehong pangalan ng aso bilang password. walang duda na ang litratong iyon ay umiikot na sa buong office at lahat ng iyon ay salamat sa walang hiyang ka-trabaho ko, at isa na akong kakatuwang tao sa loob ng office. hindi ko na ginalaw ang kape ko at umuwi na lang, habang pinipigilan ko ang bawat emosyon na bumuhos hanggang makarating ako sa safety ng bahay. halos hindi ako matigil sa kaiiyak nung gabing 'yun, iniisip ko na ang mga mukha ng mga ka-trabaho ko habang tigang na tigang na nakatitig sa hubad kong katawan. mga alas tres na ng madaling araw, doon ko lang na-realize na wala ng kwenta para pa magpaka-lunod ako sa kahihiyan. kailangan kong gumawa ng plano para maka-survive sa ganitong uri ng workplace. quitting is not an option kasi masyadong malaki ang pasweldo nila para tumigil ako. tsaka, halos tinapay na lang ang kaya kong bilhin sa araw-araw. ang pangalawa kong option ay pumunta sa hr, but there's no way i was going to open that can of worms. hindi ko mapapatunayan kong sino talaga ang nag-send ng mga mensahe na iyon. last option? stick with it, keep my head down, gawin ang trabaho na pinasukan ko at 'wag pansinin ang iba pang mga harassment na gagawin nila. 'yun nga ang ginawa ko. sa kabuuan ng isang linggong training ko ay pumapasok ako on time, hindi ako umaalis sa desk ko liban na lang kung pupunta sa palikuran. iniwasan ko rin ang kahit anong contact kanino man at pinanatili ko lang ang aking mga mata sa mga inanimate objects. salamat kay j. espiritu, palagi akong on top ng training ko. sa bawat bagong task na galing sa manager ko, laging may katumbas na entry sa kanyang notebook. wala ng nakaka-gagong texts at face-to-face na kumprontasyon, pero mayroong kakatuwang pakiramdam na panibagong sisira sa kalagayan ko. sa darating na biyernes na ang huling training ko, na nagdala sa akin sa huling entry sa notebook. night shift survival guide: - matulog sa buong umaga bago ang shift at 'wag na 'wag kang matutulog. - walang sino man ang dapat maka-pasok. - panatilihing may pepper spray na dala. (sa kahit anong sitwasyon). - i-check ang bawat aisle, meeting rooms. huwag kalimutang i-check ang ilalim ng lamesa, balkonahe, kitchen tables at kahit likod ng cooler. - laging mag-open ng skype na naka-ready sa emergency in case na hindi gumana ang mobile services. - panatilihing updated sa kaibigan/pamilya/lover kada oras. ang nasabing listahan ay medyo may kahulugan. una, sabi ng hr puwede naman akong matulog sa pagitan ng 2-5 am, basta malapit palagi sa akin ang office smartphone. mayroon nga silang pull out couch sa isang conference room para lang talaga sa ganitong sitwasyon. pangalawa, ang buong shift ay phone calls, kaya palaging may paraan para maka-tawag mula sa office phone, tama? lastly, ang mga naka-outlined sa ""guide"" ay parang o.a at paranoid. siguro 'yung listahan ay satirical? (ewan ko). siguro si espiritu parehas kami ng pakiramdam tungkol sa mga tila patay gutom na mga asong cold-blooded na co-workers? pero 'yung isip ko nag-tatrabaho ng sobra-sobra para makita ang logic sa likod ng mga pag-iingat na ito. may kakatuwa akong pakiramdam na may importanteng impormasyon akong hindi nalalaman. lahat 'yun iniisip ko habang paalis ako ng bahay nung biyernes na 'yun, last day ng training ko. ""andrew"", - dahan-dahan akong lumapit sa kanya. ""puwede ba mag-tanong?"" ""sure thing"", - sagot n'ya na may maaliwalas na ngiti sa kanyang mga labi. ""nagtataka lang ako, bakit wala akong nakikitang ibang support agents. i mean, 'di ba dapat merong at least lima pang tao para ma-cover 'yung six-day rotation cycle?"" ""kailangan mong tanungin ang manager mo tungkol d'yan. most likely naka-kalat sila sa iba pang branch sa syudad. normal lang naman 'yun sa ganoong kaso"", - sagot n'ya. pakiramdam ko tapos na kami sa diskusyon na 'yun matapos s'yang bumalik sa final tasks n'ya para sa linggong iyon. ""meron bang ibang agent na nag-trabaho dito liban sa akin?"" - pagpapatuloy ko, dahil ganun na lamang ang kagustuhan kong malaman ang iba pang detalye sa babaeng nag-fill out ng notebook na s'ya namang ginagamit ko sa buong linggong iyon. ""oo, may isang babae na humawak sa posisyon mo ng panandalian"", - ani ni andrew, habang naka-titig pa rin sa screen ng kanyang screen. pero napansin kong tumigil na s'ya sa pag-tatype o pag-galaw ng mouse. wari ko ay naka-titig lang s'ya sa iisang spot sa monitor n'ya. ""andrew"", - nag-salubong ang mga kilay ko. ""sino 'yung nag-trabaho malapit sa main working space na talagang nakaka-inis? maputla, medyo payat, maitim at kulot na buhok?"" - tanong ko, habang nagpapaikot ng daliri sa bandang ulunan ko para i-describe ang pagkaka-kulot ng nasabing lalake. ""ah... si michael"", - sagot nito, napansin nito ang pagiging iritable ng boses ko. ""may problema ba? ginugulo ka ba n'ya?"" ""hindi"" - sagot ko, pero sa isip-isip ko ay nagtatalo na ang emosyon at sarili ko. ""have a good weekend, andrew"" ""ikaw din"", - sagot nito, halata na may pagtataka sa boses nito habang papaalis ako. sa buong weekend na 'yun ay binabalik-balikan ko ang mga nangyari sa akin sa unang linggo ko. pakiramdam ko may hindi sinasabi si andrew sa akin na importante. wala namang rason para maging iretable s'ya nung nabanggit ko 'yung babaeng nag-trabaho bago ako. may nag-reklamo na kaya kay michael dati? pu-puwede kayang si j. espiritu? si michael ba ang dahilan ng survival guide sa notebook? bakit s'ya umalis? napaka-daming teorya ang bumagabag sa buong weekend ko. bago ko pa nalaman, oras na para bumalik sa trabaho. ito ang araw na talagang sobrang daming trabaho. kahapon ay lunes, ang unang regular day shift. mabilis lang dumaan ang nasabing araw, habang aligaga ako sa pag-sagot ng tawag, recording, sorting at assigning ng dose-dosenang customer complaints sa system namin. hindi sapat ang salitang nasanay na ako at pagkatapos ng araw na 'yun ay sobrang pagod at ubos na ako. saktong maglo-logout na ako, naka-tanggap na naman ako ng mensahe mula sa hindi kilalang number. ""ang sipag mo naman. hindi na ako makapag-hintay na mag night shift ka"" seryoso?! ito ang kauna-unahang mensahe na bumalot sa buong pagkatao ko ng takot. agad-agad kong ginala ang paningin ko kung nasa paligid ba si michael para kumprontahin ko s'ya sa pagse-send ng mensahe, pero kanina pa pala s'ya umalis. matapos kong pakalmahin ang sarili ko, umuwi na ako at sinusubukan kong hanapin si j. espiritu online. ang pinaka best bet ko noon ay sa linkedin, at doon nga ay sinusubukan kong galugarin ang buong listahan ng mga babae na may kinalaman sa proficient technologies na naka-lagay sa profile nila (halos kakaunti lang talaga sila). nung wala akong makita ay pumunta ako kay andrew at doon nga sa friend list n'ya ay sa wakas nakita ko na ang hinahanap ko. may babae na pangalan ay jennah espiritu at unemployed ang status. nag-send ako ng friend request na may mensahe na nag-papakilala at tinanong ko s'ya kung hinarass ba s'ya ng isa n'yang ka-trabaho. sa wakas, pakiramdam ko may patutunguhan na ako, natulog ako at inihanda ang sarili para sa bukas na event. naisip ko na baka may kakaibang mangyayari dahil sa pagbabago ng schedule nung natulog ako ng miyerkules. nag-check ako ng linkedin halos pagka-gising ko mga ala una. walang kahit anong sign kay jennah, kaya naman natulog ulit ako para makapag-handa sa night shift. medyo kinakabahan ako at excited at the same time kasi puwede ko ng mas malibot ang buong place of work ko intimately. dahil walang day crowd, malaya akong makaka-gala at ma-eenjoy ang cookies, dumura sa baso ni michael, kahit ano! may mga iilan pa ring mga nag-tatrabaho nung dumating ako para sa shift ko, pero hindi ko naman iyon pinansin at dahil sa nag-uumapaw na mga tawag at chats na aasikasuhin. makalipas ang dalawang oras, ang bugso ng mga tawag at chats pati mga tickets ay unti-unting bumagal hanggang tuluyan na nga itong tumigil ng sabay-sabay halos alas onse na ng gabi noon. sumandal ako sa kinauupuan ko at ginala-gala ang mga paningin sa aking workspace. wala ng tao noon sa office at least sa nakikita ko. naka-bukas ang lahat ng ilaw pero nung tinanggal ko ang headphones ko, may narinig akong mahinang jingling melody sa hindi kalayuan. para s'yang christmas carol, pero hirap akong tukuyin kong saan ito nangga-galing. wala namang dahilan para matakot ako sa pangyayari, pero pakiramdam ko ang mga nagtayuang balahibo sa mga kamay ko ay nagsilbing alarm. nang tumayo ako sa aking kinauupuan, nawala 'yung melody. well, naging paranoid na ako dati. minsan ko ng inisip na na may lalaking sumusunod sa akin isang gabi hanggang nilagpasan n'ya ako at nagtungo sa kalapit na tindahan sa 'di kalayuan. kahit mag-isa lang ako, lagi kong dino-double at triple check ang mga lock ng bahay bago matulog. aaminin ko na ang mga takot ko ay wala naman talagang basehan. mayroong naka-iwan ng headphones na konektado pa rin sa computer nito at naka-on ang music. o siguro may office party sa ibang kumpanya sa baba ng building. ang makarinig ng kanta ay nakaka-takot lamang sa mga kakatuwang horror movies, 'di ba? 'di ba?! para maka-siguro, hinalughog ko ang office para maka-siguro na mag-isa na nga lang ako. habang naglalakad sa gitna ng mga magkaka-dikit na desks, naisip ko kung gaano ako ka-swerte na mayroon akong sariling corner spot. hindi ko siguro kakayanin na mapalapit sa kahit sinong mga hindi kaaya-aya kong mga co-workers. matapos ko ma-check ang bawat rows ay dumiretcho ako sa front desk area at nagmamasid sa mga kagamitan ni andrew sa paghahanap ng clues. nung wala akong makitang clues ay bumalik ako sa main room ng pantry. unti-unti ng mas nagiging relaxed ang mga senses ko at tsaka ko lang napag-tanto na napasarap ata ang taste-testing ko sa mga cookies sa halip na mag-hanap ng mga kahina-hinalang mga bagay. kailangan ko ng tumigil sa kaka-kain ng cookies, pero dahil bumalik na naman ang kaninang tunog na naririnig ko, mas malakas s'ya ngayon. at the same time, ang work smartphone ko (na kinakailangan dala-dala namin kung aalis kami sa aming work station) tumunog at may mensahe mula sa hindi na namang kilalang number. so, nag-eenjoy ka ba sa cookies, ha? nanigas ang buong katawan ko habang prino-proseso ng utak ko ang mga pangyayari. siguro hindi talaga umalis ng office si michael at ngayon tinatakot ako. kinalikot ko ang tenga ko noon at nakinig ng maigi. walang kahit sino sa pantry as least sa nakikita at naririnig ko. tsaka, kung si michael ay nasa main workspace, hindi naman ganun kahirap na hulaan o sabihin na kumakain ako ng cookies. habang dahan-dahan akong humihinga, hindi ko muna pinansin ang tunog at nakinig ako ng maigi kung may iba pa akong tunog na maririnig. wala. dahan-dahan, naglakad ako sa may pantry drawers at doon may nakita akong malaking kutsilyo. alam ko bang gumamit ng kutsilyo? hindi. kaya ko kayang paalisin kung sino man ang unarmed na kalaban? syempre. papunta na sana ako pabalik sa aking work station ng biglang may tawag na pumasok mula sa work phone. ipinosisyon ko ang sarili ko ng kumportable sa pader ng pantry, kutsilyo sa kanang kamay, cell phone sa kabila, bago pa ako maka-sagot with the standard customer support greeting. nag static na sa kabilang linya at iba pang ingay sunod ang tuluyang pagka-putol ng linya at katahimikan. nung tinignan ko ang cell phone, nakita kong naka-patay na ito. sinubukan kong buksan ulit ito, pero hindi na ito gumagana. ok, ngayon kailangan ko ng bumalik sa computer ko in case na may pumasok pang mga tawag. naalala ko bigla ang isa sa mga guide na galing kay jennah habang isinusuksok ko ang walang kwentang cell phone sa bulsa ko. - laging mag-open ng skype na naka-ready sa emergency in case na hindi gumana ang mobile services. nangyari rin kaya 'to sa kanya? ang mga instructions sa notebook ay unti-unti ng nagkaroon ng kahulugan, at minumura ko ang sarili ko dahil sa pagiging tanga. sa oras na lumabas ang mga salita sa bibig ko ay may isa na namang mensahe ang dumating sa cell phone. kinuha ko iyon at sinubukang i-unlock, pero 'yung regular home screen ay hindi lumalabas. ang lumabas lang ay isang white screen na may maikling text. putang ina. ang mga babae dapat hindi ginagamit ng ganung mga uri ng salita. matapos kong mabasa 'yun ay nawala na ito sa screen at may panibagong text ang lumabas. bakit hindi ka lumabas at makipag-laro? huwag mo ng isiping bitbitin pa 'yang kutsilyong hawak mo. wala ring magagawa 'yan sa hawak kong baril. tinapon ko ang cell phone ko sa lapag at agad-agad ay nagtungo ako sa aking computer. ang tunog ay mas lalong lumakas habang papalapit ako sa aking lamesa, doon ay nakita kong may isang baboy na stuffed toy. may fabric button ito sa bandang paanan at music note na kasama. dito nagmumula ang tunog at nagpapatunay lamang na hindi ako mag-isa at may kung sino akong kasama. ang malala pa, pinapanood nila ang bawat galaw ko at sinusubukang takutin gamit ang mga laruang pambata. unti-unti ng dumadaloy ang pagpapanic sa aking buong katawan at naghahanda na sa fight or flight scenario. huminga ako ng malalim, sinusubukan kong pakalmahin ang buong katawan ko. so far wala pa naman akong naririnig ng kahit anong palatandaan na may ibang tao sa loob ng office. may mga background noises galing sa syudad sa labas at ang mga ingay mula sa naka-limutang patayin na computer ng isang employee. kung sino man ang gumagawa nito sa akin, kailangan kong malaman ang kanilang eksaktong lokasyon para maplano ko ng maayos ang pag-takas ko. isa pa, kailangan kong maka-kuha ng tulong sa lalong mas madaling panahon. habang iginigilid ko ang laruan ay umupo na ako sa aking upuan at pinull-up ang skype for business application. mabilis akong nag-dial ng 911, habang naka-loudspeaker ang telepono. tumunog na nga ang dial tone at agad-agad ay may live operator na sa kabilang linya. ibibigay ko na sana ang mga hindi kanais-nais na pangyayari sa akin ng mga oras na iyon ng may biglang humawak sa bukong-bukong ko mula sa ilalim ng lamesa. halos maubos ang buong lakas ko sa pagsigaw habang nagpu-pumiglas ang mga paa at mabilis na tumakbo sa abot ng aking makakaya sa bilis na hindi ko akaling kaya ko. may narinig akong kung anong kumusyon sa aking likuran habang tumakbo, kasunod ng isang malakas ng putok, na inisip ko na lamang na galing sa kung ano o sino man ang humahabol sa akin. bago ko pa malaman ay halos nasa ground floor na ako papunta sa pinto lagpas sa gwardiya na halatang nagulat sa mga nangyayari. ang malamig na hangin ay mabilis na pumasok sa manipis kong sweater habang papalapit ako sa isang malapit na pedestrian para humingi ng tulong. tumawag sila ng 911 at ang mga pulis ay agad namang dumating wala pang sampung minuto. habang naghihintay ako kasama ang gwardiya para sa kanilang pag-dating, hindi maalis sa isip ko ang sinulat ni jennah na warning, at kung gaano ako ka-tanga para ipagsa walang bahala ang mga ito. - i-check ang ang bawat aisle, meeting room. huwag kalimutang i-check ang ilalim ng lamesa, balkonahe, kitchen tables at kahit likod ng cooler. agad-agad namang sinulat ng pulis ang mga nangyari sa akin at iniwan ako kasama ang isang pulis officer, umakyat s'ya para i-check ang office. wala namang naka-labas-masok sa building mula nung tumakbo ako palabas, kaya malaki ang posibilidad na naroroon pa rin ang salarin at nagtatago sa loob. sa pag-iisip ay halos bumaliktad ang buong sikmura ko at mas lalo akong lumapit sa may armas kong kasama. maya-maya pa matapos kaming iwanan ng mga pulis, ang kasama kong pulis ay nag-radyo at isa-isa may mga boses na nagpapa-palit-palit sa radyo na humingi ng backup at nga mga codes na hindi ko maintindihan. mabilis na nag-escalate ang mga sumunod na pangyayari. imbis na pauwi ay dinala nila ako sa police station at doon ay nanatili ako sa isang interrogation room ng halos 2 oras bago pa sa wakas may dalawang pulis officer ang kumausap sa akin. pagod na ako noon, miserable ang kalagayan at higit sa lahat litong-lito sa kung papaano naganap ang mga pangyayari. gusto ko ng umuwi pero nanatili pa ako ng ilang oras para i-kuwento ang mga pangyayari sa dalawang pulis officer. 'ahh... meron kang kutsilyong hawak habang tumakbo ka galing sa pantry papunta sa lamesa mo? sigurado ka ba?' tanong ng isang nakaka-tandang officer na nagpakilala bilang senior investigator manlapig. 'ah. ah... oo.' pautal-utal kong sagot sa kanya. 'naniniwala akong meron. nag-papanic na ako noon, kaya mahirap sabihin. tapos may baboy na stuffed toy, ' sabi ko, habang tila baga'y nawawalan ako ng abilidad na mag-isip ng tama. 'at naniniwala ka na ang taong humaharass sa'yo ay si michael villareal?' sabi ng isa pang officer, hindi ko maalala 'yung pangalan n'ya. wala s'yang badge. 'hindi ko alam buong pangalan n'ya, pero wala na akong ibang kilala na iba pang responsable.' 'at sa huling pagkakataon, just for the record, anong nangyari matapos mong mag-dial ng 911?' tanong ni manlapig sa ika-apat na pagkakataon sa gabing 'yun. 'may kung sino ang humawak sa binti ko. bukong-bukong, actually. nangyari 'yun bago pa ako magkaroon ng pagkakataong ipaliwanag ang sitwasyon sa operator. nagsusumigaw at piglas ang mga paa ko tapos tumakbo hanggang may makita akong tao sa labas na pina-tawag ako sa 911 para sa tulong.' sagot ko, habang pagod na pagod sa paulit-ulit at paikot-ikot na pagtatanong. 'si michael villareal ay natagpuang patay sa hindi kalayuan ng iyong lamesa nung pumunta ang officer namin sa pinang-yarihan ng insidente. nakita mo ba ang kanyang katawan nung tumakbo ka palabas ng office?' tanong ng isang officer. halos malaglag ang panga ko sa mga narinig ko at tumitig sa dalawang pulis habang balisa at nanginginig sa takot. 'hi.. hi.. hindi,' pabulong akong nag-salita, 'hindi ko maintindihan,' 'sinaksak s'ya hanggang sa mamatay gamit ang malaking kutsilyo. ang katawan n'ya ay balot ng dalawampu't-tatlong saksak,' paliwanag ni manlapig. 'at nakita namin ang kutsilyo ay nakabaon sa bibig nito, dahilan para dumikit ito sa sahig diretcho sa lalamunan,' 'may rason kami para pagsuspetyahan na ito rin ang sinasabi mong kutsilyo,' dagdag pa ng pangalawang officer. nakatitig ako sa dalawang pulis officer ng tahimik, hirap akong intindihin ang mga pangyayari lalo na't ang utak ko ay halos mawala na sa ulirat. 'ang mga sinabi mo ay nagpapatunay lamang sa mga natagpuaan namin sa cell phone ni michael villareal. nalaman namin na may roon siyang hacking apps,' pagpapatuloy ng senior officer. 'natagpuan din naman ang ilan mo pang mga hubong larawan at ang mga mensahe na iyong nabanggit. mayroon s'yang baril at nakita rin naman ang basyo ng bala nung binaril ka n'ya habang papatakas ka.' 'ang hindi namin maintindihan ay kung papaano s'ya namatay.' dagdag pa ng pangalawang officer, halatang hindi s'ya naniniwala sa aking reaksyon. 'ok lang kung napatay mo s'ya dahil sa self-defense, aya. may balak s'yang masama sa'yo.' 'hindi,' pautal-utal kong sagot. 'pangako, wala akong ideya... oh, oh my god.' naiyak na ako dahil sa mga nangyayari. 'ibig kong sabihin, nung nakaraang buwan lang may nag-report sa kanya galing sa isa n'yang co-worker,' sabi ni manlapig. 'jennah,' bulong ko. 'kilala mo si miss espiritu?' tanong ng pangalawang officer, at ng suspetya sa kanyang mga mats. 'hindi,' ako ang pumalit sa lamesa n'ya at nakuha ko ang notebook n'ya. dapat sinabi ko na 'to kanina pa. anong sabi sa report? doon nga ay nagtitigan ang dalawang pulis at maka-lipas ang ilang sandali ay inilatag at ipinaliwanag ni manlapig ang mga hindi magandang nangyari kay jennah na halos mangyari na sa akin. si jennah espiritu ay dumiretcho sa pinaka-malapit na hospital mula sa kanyang unang night shift tatlong buwan na ang nakakaraan. sobrang bugbog ng katawan n'ya at sugatan, at gustong mag-file ng anonymous rape kit. ang natanong damage n'ya sa kanyang puwerta ay sobrang severe na kinailangan n'yang sumailalim sa operasyon at magpatahi. nag-file s'ya ng police report makalipas ang dalawang buwan matapos s'yang hindi pumasa sa probationary period sa inyong kumpanya, ng nawala s'ya sa trabaho (ang nagiisang paraan para mabayaran ang kanyang utang sa hospital). ang nangyari ay ang kanyang aligasyon kontra kay michael villareal, na gumastos s'ya ng malaki sama mo pa ang hindi mabilang na kanyang mga co-workers na kumontra sa kanya laban sa magalang at kaaya-ayang katangian ni michael. 'pero kahapon lang ay iniurong na n'ya lahat ng mga isinampa n'yang kaso kay michael,' sabi ng walang badge na pulis. 'kasalukuyan naming inaalam ang kinaroroonan ni espiritu para ma-interview namin s'ya. sigurado ako na ngayon malinaw na kung bakit may suspetya kami sa iyo bilang nakikilala mo espiritu.' nagpatuloy ang mga tanong ng dalawang pulis hanggang may isang lalaki na nag-abot sa kanya ng isang sobre. natukoy na ng forensics ang fingerprint na nakita sa kutsilyo at ang blood-spatter patterns. kinailangan ko ring mag-submit ng dna samples para maka-tulong sa imbestigasyon at sa wakas ay pina-uwi na nila ako. sa bahay, dahil sa sobrang pagod, hindi ako maka-tulog. wala akong gamit na naiuwi. bag, cell phone at kahit ang jacket ko ay kinailangan i-submit bilang ebidensya. kaya naman napilitan akong gamitin ang luma kong laptop, umaasa na malibang sa internet. ang browser ko ay naka-login pa rin sa linkedin account ko mula sa nakaraang login, at nirefreshed ko ang page bilang naka-sanayan. isang maliit na red icon ang lumitaw na mayroon akong bagong mensahe. jennah. nagre-reply na s'ya sa akin. don't worry, sis. i took care of it. ❤️",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/t77k69/tagalized_story/,5 03 2022

"Happy women's month! Bilang tugon sa issue na bumabalot sa trans women, ito ay isang maikling informative post tungkol sa SOGIE, partikular na sa Gender Identity para ipaintindi at mabawasan ang kalituhan ukol dito.","primer image: https://flyingketchup.ph/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/sogie3-576x1024.jpg alam niyo ba na lahat ng tao may sogie? ano nga ba ang sogie? acronym ito na ang ibig sabihin ay... s - sex: as in biological, base sa ari nang ipinanganak tayo (female, male, intersex). akma rin ang paggamit ng assigned gender at birth (agab) dito: (assigned female at birth/afab, assigned male at birth/amab) o - orientation: base sa romantic at/o sexual attraction natin (straight, gay, lesbian, etc. / heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, pansexual, asexual, etc.) gi - gender identity: base sa pansariling pagkakakilanlan ayon sa kasarian o gender self-identity - cisgender - magkatugma ang agab sa gender identity (cisgender male: agab identifying as a man; afab identifying as a woman - gender fluid - nagiiba depende sa panahon, puwedeng tumutugma, puwedeng hindi tumutugma - transgender - hindi magkatugma ang agab sa gender identity (trans woman: amab identifying as a woman, afab identifying as a man, af/mab identifying as non-binary*] *non-binary - puwedeng halong man at woman, puwedeng wala e - expression: panlabas na pagpapakita (masculine, feminine, or androgynous [sa gitna]) ang sogie, puwedeng halo-halo - puwede kang maging cisgender straight male presenting as feminine, puwedeng maging gay transman presenting as androgynous/feminine. oo, medyo mahirap intindihin minsan, pero ang pag-parse layunin nang paghiwalay ng s, o, gi, at sa e ay upang tulungang intindihin ang mga tao na hindi tumutugma sa typical o tradisyunal na kaalaman - upang intindihin ang kanilang sarili o ang ibang tao. besides, mas bihira ang magkakahalong sogie, pero kung may ma-encounter tayo na halo-halo, maskaya nating intindihin kung matandaan mo ang sogie. madalas nating naririnig o mababasa na hindi totoong babae ang transwoman, masbihira ang panawagan na hindi totoong lalake ang transman. bakit? sa aking kaalaman, hindi magkahiwalay ang sex at gender identity sa ating mga wika. sa tagalog, pasok sa salitang ""kasarian"" ang sex at gender. kaya maiintindihan din natin kung bakit may ganitong kalituhan. pero, hindi naman natin ipagkakaila na malakas ang impluwensya ng mga banyaga sa kulturang pilipino. ginamit ko as example ang wikang tagalog, pero sa filipino, pasok ang salitang gender sa wikang ito. malakas ang impluwensya ng mga banyaga sa atin, wag natin ito ipagkaila - parte na ito ng kulturang pilipino. pero, may sariling atin din tayo tulad ng bakla na puwedeng tumukoy sa homosexual at/o transwoman - may sarili tayong mga salita at kultura na tumutukoy sa sogie na iba sa banyaga. hindi ito black or white na dapat pumili tayo sa banyaga o sa lokal na pagkakaintindi, puwedeng gumawa ng hybrid na pagkakaintindi dito. useful naman ang sogie framework, parte na rin naman ang kulturang bakla sa kulturang pilipino. puwede natin palaganapin ang consciousness ukol sa gender kapag magawan ng paraan para magamit ang mga ito. **ano ang issue sa gender identity?** balikan natin ang issue sa transman/woman. ang sinasabi ng iba, hindi babae ang transwoman. iklaro natin na hindi female ang transwoman, oo, never silang magiging female - a male cannot be female. but a male can identify as woman. paano? pagtuunan natin ng pansin ang ""identity"". mag-imagine tayo ng baller o mahilig sa basketball, may mabubuo tayong mga imahe na hindi magkakalayo sa isa't-isa. mag-imagine tayo ng skater, ng coffee lover, ng artist, ng rocker, ng car enthusiast, ng kung anu-ano pa. may nabubuo rin tayong imahe ng kanilang lifestyle na tumutukoy sa kanilang pananamit, mga gawain, kilos, atbp. sa baller, mai-imagine natin na naglalaro at mahilig silang manuod ng basketball - up to date sa mga events ng nba at kung ano pa. may iba-iba tayong imahe ng mga identity na ito, pero valid lahat ng interpretation natin sa mga ito. wala namang may authority para sabihin hindi ka ganito. isipin natin si pacquiao, ano ang imahe natin sa kaniya? boxer, pulitiko (????). pero diba mahilig rin siya mag basketball? pero nang subukan niya maglaro, pinagtatawanan siya ng mga tao. ""hindi ka basketbolista!"" ""sa boxing ka na lang!"". ""hindi ka bagay sa basketball"" isa pa, extreme example naman. isang tao na pinanganak na may congenital issue kaya physically hindi siya puwede mag-skate. pero gustong-gusto niya maging skater. nagdadamit siya na akma sa pagkakaintindi niya ng skater at sumusunod sa mga balita at tumatambay siya sa mga nags-skate. matatawag ba natin siyang skater kahit na hindi niya kaya mag-skate? kung may mahirap na mahilig sa kape, dinalaw ng kaibigan na mahilig rin sa kape. nadismaya nang nakita na percolator ""lang"" ang gamit niya. ""pano mo nasabing enthusiast ka kung ganiyan lang kape mo?"". ang tawag dito, gatekeeping: may standards ang mga tao na sila rin lang ang may gawa at kung hindi ka pasok dito, out ka - isang poser o nagco-cosplay lang. ""pero iba ang gender, nakabase yan sa sex"" nakabase ang masculinity at femininity sa gender identity. ano ang masculinity at femininity? ito ay mga traits na kadalasan naa-assign sa kalalakihan o kababaihan. kung nakabase ito sa biology, dapat exclusive ang mga traits na ito sa male at female lang. kung ang lalake ay emotional, nababawasan ba ang pagiging male niya, o ang nakikitang pagkalalaki niya? kung matapang ang babae, less female ba sila, o nagpapakita sila ng masculine traits? being male/female is not about masculinity/femininity, but being a man or a woman is related to masculinity/femininity. paano ang mga masculine women at feminine men? kung gumagamit ka ng gamer mouse, keyboard, chair, at computer, at naglalaro ka ng video games, choice mo parin kung tatawagin mo sarili mo na gamer o hinde. puwede kang mag bike para pumasok nang hindi tinatawag ang sarili mo na cyclist, puwede kang maging masculine at mag-identify as a woman. walang nagmamay-ari ng mga traits na ito, kahit sa masculinity o femininity, madalas lang nakakabit sa male at female ang mga ito. tulad ng mga example sa taas, valid ang bawat isang pansariling interpretation kung ano ang masculine at ano ang feminine. iba-iba ang experience ng bawat isang tao ukol dito. sa tahanan (nanay/tatay), sa mga kapitbahay, sa socioeconomic status (e.g. fashion, activities na panlalake/pambabae) - valid lahat ng interpretation natin diyan. ikumpara natin sa ethic groups at race. bakit masama na magsuot ng damit ng iba o tanggalin sa konteksto ang mga tradisyon nila? kasi ito ay heritage nila, kultura na nakakabit sa kanilang mga grupo na may kaakibat na meaning. walang ganito ang masculinity at femininity. tulad ng halimbawa na disabled skater at low-income coffee lover, sino ba tayo para harangin sila sa pagkakakilala nila sa kanilang sarili? *hindi pinili ng mga trans people na malagay sila sa katawan na hindi akma sa gender identity nila, sana intindihin natin ang dinaranas nila dahil dito.* edit: isipin din natin na ang masculinity/feminity ay automatic nang ia-assign ayon lang sa sex simula pa lang ng pagkabata. hindi nabibigyan ng tsansa ang tao na pumili ng kanilang gender identity hanggang sa magkamalay tayo. parte ito ng pagiging tao, oo, pero magandang isipin sa pinagdadaanan ng mga trans. **bakit tinatawag na transphobe sa mga taong sumasalungat sa opinyon na ito?** ang pagiging trans ng tao ay nakabase sa gender identity niya, kapag sinabi natin na hindi sila ""real man/woman"", dinedeny natin ang gender identity nila. ang personal take ko diyan, transphobe ka if you are informed and justify this denial. maiintindihan naman natin kung nalilito ang tao tungkol dito. pero yung ibang mga tao, simula pa lang nang malaman nila ang gender identity nila, madami nang takot at anxiety na naramdaman kaya naiintindihan ko rin ang galit nila. sigurado ako na maraming butas sa explanation ko na to kasi minamadali ko lang talaga haha. sana mabigyan ko ng sagot yung mga tanong dito. let's be civil please. give everyone the benefit of the doubt :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/11gp69m/happy_womens_month_bilang_tugon_sa_issue_na/,3 03 2023

Got into a motor accident due to bad road condition,"hi guys! gusto ko sana magtanong ng payo if i can be compensated and/or file for damages for the accident that happened to me last night. **context** nagmomotor kami ng kapatid ko. sa may outer lane kami dumaan dahil malalaki yung mga truck sa may middle lanes. newly asphated yung road. kapag nag aasphalt ng road, tumataas yung elevation ng new road. pero may old drainage na di naisabay sa pag taas ng road elevation, so naging pot hole sya. gabi na during our ride tapos hindi well lit ang road. wala ring nailagay na cover or metal grating para mapantay ang level ng drainage dun sa bagong level ng road. wala ring any warning or signage to inform the motorists na may pot hole doon. **damages** so nagtamo kami ng lots of abrasions sa katawan namin. heavily damaged din yung motor namin. di pa ako makalakad ngayon. yung kapatid ko was put into a near death situation dahil malapit sya masagasaan ng truck nung tumilapon sya. still thankful that we're now safe and alive. btw kahapon after the incident nagpa hospital kami, nag xray at initial findings is wala namang serious injuries. nagkausap na rin kami ng police patrol kahapon na gagawan namin ng police report tomorrow. **question** may i ask if ano ba process ng pag file ng complaint? kasi i think at fault either ang dpwh or ang contractor ng project for failing to implement sufficient safety measures dun sa pot hole. may i also ask if ano pa ang mga damages na pwede ko irequest aside from the direct cost ng medical and motor damages, and how to possibly substantiate them? thank you for reading! tldr; got into a motor accident due to a pot hole in the road na walang any safety warnings/ signage. how to process complaint and/ or file for damages? edit: added context",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/qt4udl/got_into_a_motor_accident_due_to_bad_road/,13 11 2021
Falling inlove pero mahirap ako.,"&#x200b; hi literally new this subreddit, eto po background, di po ako totally mahirap yung family namin yung may kaya lang, buong buhay ko iniisip ko na dapat di ako mag mahal dahil i'm already used to living a frugal life like alam mo yung wala ka pera kasi wala naman stable income ang mother ko, and personal reasons insecure ako about sa financial status ko. now na bago ako sa college, new environment and tumagal na din ang panahon i now love my self na pero there's still that insecurity about my financial status, now there's this girl that i'm really interested on, first time ko lang talaga mag ka-crush ng ganito kasi dati nga diba mababa tingin ko sa sarili ko so i never really bothered. frugal, family oriented ako, idealistic ako sa relationships talaga ako. note: this girl is from cavite and i'm from manila things happened with this girl and we're talking daily na and may plano kami sa december mag pass ng documents and i invited her to go out after that, ang problema lang ay pano makipag date ng mababa lang budget? originally we were supposed to go to fine arts museum, pero nakapunta na kami dun with out classmates now napag usapan namin na gusto namin sa ayala museum eh may entrance fee dun and talk about transportation and food, natatakot na ko pano ko ibubudget or how can i get the funds, now i'm finding places sa manila na magugutuhan namin dalawa. we don't like yung arcade or something na magastos talaga, gusto namin art museums, kanina pinaalala ako ni mama na ""mag jojowa ka wala naman pera"" and napaiisip nanaman ako na ""tama ba na ma fall inlove ako kahit walang pera?"" bumabalik nanaman yung stigma sa katawan ko na bawal ako mag mahal dahil sa financial situation ko, and baka ma turn off si girl na wala akong pera? feeling ko naman hindi siya ganun pero there's still that lingering feeling. i want to experience new things, i want to fall in love pero pwede ba talaga yan if mahirap ka lang? most of my friends may kaya sa buhay and ako lang talaga yung walang pera, mahirap etc, etc... i don't know why tbh kung bakit pumayag si girl yung inask out ko siya pero i'm happy that i'm experiencing new things in my life! like super ganda niya, siya pinakang maganda sa buong class namin and her personality is just so charming to me, and there's me the not so attractive guy. and feeling ko may kaya din si girl and her family.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/yyyxr3/falling_inlove_pero_mahirap_ako/,19 11 2022

Kaibigan,"""sab..."" nanginig ako nang marinig ang boses ng aking matalik na kaibigan sa kabilang linya. lately, pakiramdam ko ang layo layo niya sakin. hindi ko siya maramdaman, hindi siya yung babaeng nakikita kong masigla, masiyahin at walang takot harapin ang kanyang problema. ""kate, nasaan ka?"" kalmado kong tanong sa kanya. abot abot ang kabang nararamdaman ko. natatakot sa posibleng mangyari. lakad takbo ang aking ginagawa papunta sa kanila. ""ayoko na"" walang ganang sagot ni kate. ""pagod na ako, sab."" walang buhay niyang sagot. ""kate, please stay with me. wag mo ibababa ang tawag. malapit na ako ha?"" suyo ko sa kanya. rinig ko ang malalim niyang paghinga sa kabilang linya. ramdam ko ang kanyang lungkot, tumatagos ito sa aking pagkatao, nag-usal ako ng panalangin sa aking isipan at tumakbo na sa kanilang bahay. apat na bahay na lang lalagpasan ko at malapit na ako. ""sorry, sab."" may narinig akong pagbagsak ng isang bigay kasunod ng pagputol ng tawag. nanlalamig ang aking katawan, kahit sa nanlalabong mga paningin dahil sa mga luhang humaharang rito ay mabilis akong pumunta sa kanilang bahay. ""tita! tito!"" sigaw ko nang makaabot ako sa kanilang pinto, maya maya pa ay binuksan ng kuya ni kate ito. ""uy sab, miss me?"" tanong ni matt ng pabiro pero tinulak ko siya at bago man ako makaakyat ay natanaw ko pa ang ibang masasayang miyembro ng pamilya ni kate. lingid sa mga ngiti ng bawat isa meron na pala isa sa kanilang nagdurusa. ""sab! bat ka nagmamadali?"" sigaw ni matt sa ibaba ng hagdan at napamura ako rito saka sumigaw ""p\*tangina tumawag kayo ng ambulansya!!"" nakalock ang kwarto ni kate kaya kinalampag ko ito ng kinalampag, nagsiakyatan na rin ang magulang ni kate at sinimula nilang tawagin ito hanggang sa tuluyan ng sinira ni tito ang kanyang pintuan. ""kate! kate!"" sigaw ko rito at nagtungo sa kanyang banyo at naabutan namin si kate na nakahandusay sa sahig at napapalibutan na siya ng dugo. ""kate, andito na ako. shh"" haplos ko sa kanyang pisngi at humalik sa kanyang ulo. binuhat siya ni tito, umiiyak ang kanilang bunsong kapatid, ang kanyang ina nama'y natataranta at si matt ay nakatulala lamang sa aming nadatnan takot na takot man ako pero nagpakatatag ako para sa bestfriend ko. si kate, isa siyang masayahing babae, matataas na grado ang nakukuha sa eskwelahan, kinagigiliwan ng lahat, madaling maging kaibigan pero siya rin yung babaeng magaling magtago ng tunay na nararamdaman, nakangiti kahit nahihirapan. napahikbi ako ng isakay na nila si kate sa ambulansya at sumunod rito sina tita at tito, naiwan ako sa kanilang bahay kasama si matt at ang bunso nilang kapatid na limang taong gulang. binuhat ko si sarah at inalo ito. ""shh, magiging okay din ang ate kate mo. magiging okay din ang lahat."" hinaplos ko ang buhok nito at tumingin kay matt na tulala pa rin hanggang sa ngayon, nahawakan niya rin ang kanyang kapatid kung kaya't may mga dugo ang kanyang mga kamay. ""all this time, akala ko kilala ko yung kapatid ko. akala ko nagpakakuya ako sa kanya, akala ko wala siyang problema, akala ko open kami sa isa't isa"" tulala niyang sambit. ramdam ko ang sakit sa tono ni matt, maski ako akala ko nagawa ko na lahat ""this will be the lesson para sa ating lahat. no matter how happy they look, no matter how healthy they are. there's a possibility that loneliness can kill us."" napahinga ako ng malalim. ""kate wants to kill that feeling pero hindi yung mismong siya. kate is a fighter, matt. napagod lang siya pero sana sa panibagong pagkakataon na meron siya ay sana andito na tayo to help her and support her with her own battle."" mangiyak ngiyak kong sambit nang maramdaman ko na niyakap ako ni matt habang buhat buhat ko si sarah.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/10e5v8v/kaibigan/,17 01 2023

"alex, tanghaling tapat ng sabado, 2021","(any review for this is very-very much appreciated. i'm an aspiring writer po and i just launched a passion project anthology, isa po ito sa mga kwento) &#x200b; **chairman** ngayon ko lang naranasan ‘to sa tagal ko nang nanunungkulan sa barangay. isama mo na sa mga karanasang ‘yon ang lahat ng away mag-asawa, suntukan ng mga lasing, at mga batang ginagahasa sa bukiran. pero eto… ngayon ko lang napansin na buong araw ko na palang hinihimas ang rosaryong nakasabit sa leeg ko. maya’t-maya ko pa hinahalikan at binubulungan na sana’y wag mangyari sa pamilya ko ang nakita ko kanina. naririnig ko pa rin ang sigaw ni cecil, kumare’t-kapitbahay namin, tanghaling tapat ng sabado, kung saan ang tanghalian sa buong kalsada nami’y naantala dahil sa kanyang nakakakilabot na sigaw. sa ilalim ng nagbabagang init ay nagsitakbuhan kami upang sumaklolo. kinailangan ko pang iwanan ang tinola ni misis at ang isang basong softdrinks na nilalanguyan pa dalawang yelo nang ako’y tumakbo papunta sa bahay ni cecil. ngayo’y hindi pa rin ako kumakain. sa totoo nga’y hindi pa ako nakakaranas ng gutom. hindi ko pa ata kaya. sa bahay ni cecil ay dinatnan namin ang katawan ng panganay ni cecil na si joe na nakaratay sa braso ng kanyang bunsong kapatid na si alex, sa sahig ng kanilang sala. sa leeg ni joe ay nakabaon ang basag na bote na ginamit ni alex na balot na balot sa dugo ng kanyang kapatid. agad ang kapit at halik ko sa aking rosaryo nang makita ko ang imahe; na parang sinaunang obra na naglalahad ng malagim na kwento. pero ano ang kwento neto? hanggang ngayon ay wala pa rin kaming ideya kung bakit. magmula sa pagsigaw ni cecil ng, “anong nangyari?! anak, anong nangyari?!” sa tulalang alex na nakatitig sa dilat na mga mata ni joe, hanggang sa pagpunta namin dito sa aking opisina sa barangay, ay wala pa rin kaming makuhang rason mula sa bakit. sa isang maliit na kwarto sa aking opisina’y pinaupo ko muna si alex. tulala at sinusubukang burahin ang dugo sa kanyang mukha gamit ang duguan ring damit n’ya. hinainan ko ng isang bote ng softdrinks at tatlong pandesal mula pa sa agahan namin kanina si alex, na agad namang n’yang kinain ng walang pag-aalinlangan. dito na nagsimulang gumapang ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod. isang kilabot na hindi ko maipaliwanag, habang pinapanood ko si alex na walang awat sa pagkain, habang ako’y hindi ko pa rin magawang matakam sa masarap na lutong nag-aabang sa’kin sa bahay. “alex,” marahan kong sinabi. “ba’t mo ginawa ‘yun?” tumingin lamang sa’kin si alex, patay na mga mata, bibig na mabagal ang nguya. at sa kanyang paglunok ay walang mga salitang bumalik sa’kin. hindi ko alam kung bakit pero bigla kong naalala si jefferson, isang tricycle driver dito sa’min. dalawang taon na ang nakakalipas nang mapatay n’ya ang isang dayo na nakaaway n’ya sa kalsada. nangyari ‘to nang kamuntikan n’yang makasalpukan ang sasakyan ng dayo, at nang nahinto silang dalawa’y nagkasagutan muna sila bago mapikon si jefferson. hinampas n’ya ng bakal na tubo ang dayo. hindi na raw n’ya napigilan dahil sa mga mapanglait na mga salitang tinawag sa kanya. bobo, unggoy, uling, mababa. labing-isang beses paulit-ulit na hinampas ni jefferson sa ulo ang dayo, at sa sobrang lakas ng bawat hampas ay may parte na ng utak na lumabas dito. sa prisinto’y naalala ko si jefferson, iyak nang iyak at humihingi ng tawad dahil sa nangyari. hindi makakain, hindi rin makatulog. nilamon na s’ya ng konsensya n’ya, at ang konsensya n’ya ang tumulak sa kanya na agawin ang baril ng isa sa mga pulis na nagbabantay, at iputok sa kanyang sariling ulo. nasaktan si jefferson, nagalit, at di nakapagpigil. naintindihan ko ang kwento ‘nun. pero bakit hindi ko maintindihan ‘to? alam kong magkasundo ang magkapatid na ‘to. alam ko kung ga’no sila kalapit sa isa’t-isa. kaya pa’no nangyari ‘to? ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod ay gumagapang paakyat hanggang sa aking dibdib, tila ba kumakapit ng mahigpit. pasikip nang pasikip at medyo nahihirapan akong huminga. ang kakaibang pakiramdam na ‘to’y tumitindi habang nanatiling tahimik at nakatitig lamang sa’kin si alex. biglang iniabot ni alex ang kanyang kamay at dito tumalon na ang puso ko. napaatras ako sa aking kinauupuan, at mabilisan kong hinugot ang aking rosaryo mula sa pagkakatago nito sa aking damit. itinutok ko ito kay alex, na walang ibang kibo kun’di ang kunin ang bote ng softdrinks na nasa harapan n’ya. mas bumilis pa ang pagkatok sa aking dibdib, na para bang kamuntikan na kong mamatay. habang si alex nama’y pinapanood lang ako habang patuloy ang kanyang pag-inom. wala nga ata talagang mangyayari, at nang maramdaman ko kung gaano katahimik ang kwarto’y kumalma na ako. bakit sa dulo ng utak ko’y hinihiling ko na may sapi o di kaya’y isang demonyo talaga ang kaharap ko, at sa presensya ng aking rosaryo’y masasaktan s’ya. kahit anong kakaiba. kahit ano basta magkaroon lang ng eksplenasyon ang nangyari. pero siguro’y kakaiba na rin ang ikinikilos ng bata. at siguro nga’y mas dapat talaga akong matakot sa buhay kaysa sa patay. **cecil** “saan ba ko nagkulang?” tanong ni aling cecil sa mga kumare n’yang nakapalibot sa kanya sa masikip na opisina ni chairmain. napapaligiran din s’ya ng makukulay na mga pamaypay na hindi sabay-sabay ang pagaspas sa harap n’ya; nilulunod si aling cecil sa hangin. ang kanyang mukha nama’y tila ba isang rebulto ng santo kung punas-punasan ng mga panyo. “hindi ko pa rin maintindihan,” dugtong n’ya. “hindi naman ako nagkulang sa aruga. pareho ko namang pinapakita sa kanila na pantay ang pagmamahal ko sa kanila.” tuyo na ang mga mata ni aling cecil, ngunit tila ba hindi pa rin tapos ang kanyang pag-iyak. “hindi sila nag-aaway. hindi ko man lang narinig na nagtalo silang dalawa. o kung may pagtatalo man, malamang sa malamang maliit na bagay lang ‘yun. hindi yung ikakamatay mo!” isang labi ng lumapit sa tenga ni aling cecil, “alam mo tingin ko, baka inggit ‘yan. kasi si joe lang may trabaho sa kanilang dalawa, di ba? tapos si alex, wala pa rin sa kolehiyo. nag-aaral pa rin. sigurado akong ‘yun ang dahilan.” isa pang labi ang lumapit sa kabilang tenga naman ni aling cecil, “baka napikon na. kasi di ba halos s’ya na sa lahat ng gawaing bahay? baka pakiramdam n’ya porke’t mas malaki ambag ng kapatid n’ya , alila na s’ya neto.” isang labi naman na kaharap ni aling cecil ang nagsabing, “baka nagbabait-baitan lang kasi nga si joe ang halos sumasalo sa mga bayarin, pati sa pag-aaral n’ya. pero galit talaga s’ya, kasi baka naman may pagkakataong mas nabibigyang-atensyon si joe kahit hindi n’yo napapansin. kasi halimbawa uuwi s’yang pagod galing sa trabaho, syempre di n’yo maiwasang alagaan, pagsilbihan.” sa gitna ng mga labing ito’y si aling cecil, at ang ideyang unti-unting nabubuo dahil sa mga sinasabi ng mga labi sa kanya. “siguro,” sabi n’ya. “siguro nga.” **abbie** ang pangalan n’ya’y abbie. social worker daw s’ya. pagpasok n’ya’y agad bumungad sa’kin ang asul na bra sa ilalim ng dilaw na blouse nang tapatan ito ng liwanag mula sa bintanang katabi ko. sa kanyang pagtali ng buhok ay nakita kong basang-basa na ang kanyang kili-kili at kumikinang na sa pawis ang kanyang leeg. “alex?” sabi n’ya habang maya’t-mayang tinutulak ng kanyang daliri ang salamin n’yang dumudulas sa kanyang matangos na ilong. “bakit di mo ikwento muna sa’kin ang nangyari bago tayo umalis dito?” pasensya ka na, abbie. hindi ko nagawang sabihin kay chairman, na kilala pa mandin namin. hinding-hindi ko rin masasabi sa’yo. walang ibang maglalahad ng nangyari kun’di ang mga taong nais magbigay kahulugan dito, kasi kung ako tatanungin kung bakit, sa totoo lang, hindi ko rin alam ang isasagot. may nabasag akong bote sa kusina kanina, at sa pagpulot ko nito’y pumasok sa isip ko ang isang udyok. yung tipo ng udyok kapag nasa mataas kang lugar, at bigla mo na lang gustong itulak ang kasama mo. pero alam mong hindi ito dapat gawin, at kakapit ka pa nang mas mahigpit sa kanila para masiguro mong hindi ito mangyayari. ang udyok na ito’y nagsabi sa’kin na isaksak ko kay kuya ang basag na bote. at nalaman ko na lang na totoo na pala ang lahat nang dumapo sa aking balat ang mainit na dugo ni kuya. nahinto lang ako nang maramdaman ko ang buto sa leeg n’ya at nang marinig kong nabibilaukan na s’ya sa kanyang sariling dugo. hindi ko pa rin alam kung bakit. sana, tulad ng iniisip ni chairman, ay nasapian na nga lang ako. pero nakita ko ang lahat, andun ako. hindi ko lang alam na totoo pala ang lahat. namatay si kuya joe sa wala. at hindi ko matanggap na wala. normal lang sana ang sabado namin. tahimik. nanonood lang si kuya ng tv, naglilinis ako sa kusina. si nanay nama’y namamalengke ng pananghalian namin. bicol express daw ang lulutuin n’ya. puta, sinira ko ang araw. gusto kong umiyak dahil hindi na kami babalik sa salo-salo namin. “alex?” muling tawag ni abbie. “gusto kong malaman kung bakit. tayong dalawa lang. kaibigan mo ko dito. hinding-hindi ko ‘to sasabihin sa nanay mo, sa mga kapitbahay n’yo. may mga naririnig ako sa labas na dahil daw sa inggit? totoo ba ‘to? sa inggit nga? magmula nang dinala ako ni chairman dito sa maliit na kwartong ito’y napagpasyahan kong manahimik na lang sa nangyari. sa ngayo’y nilalabanan ko ang mga luha, nilalabanan ko ang panginginig ng aking bibig, at ang mga salitang gustong lumabas mula sa’kin. dapat mukhang hindi ko pinagsisisihan. dapat mukha akong galit. para naman mabigyang halaga, mabigyan ng ibig-sabihin ang pagkamatay ni kuya joe. dapat tinatatak ko sa utak ko na dapat lang! dapat lang sa kanya ang nangyari. dapat hindi ako bibigay. dahil kapag natalo ako, mamatay talaga sa wala si kuya. “sige, kung ayaw mong magkwento, ako muna. kasi naalala ko ‘tong isang batang babae at ang tatay n’yang abusado. tatay n’yang lasinggero. tatay n’yang isang beses s’yang hinipuan sa kanyang sariling kwarto at pinilit. ampon ang batang ‘yon, at tatay-tatayan n’ya lang etong umaabuso sa kanya. takot na takot ang bata dahil pakiramdam n’ya isang gabi’y papatayin na lang s’ya bigla neto. kaya naman isang gabi, nang bigla s’yang pinuntahan ng kanyang tatay upang pagsamantalahan ulit, sinasaksak ito ng bata gamit ang lapis sa mata, sa leeg, at sa dibdib.” kumuha ng panyo si abbie. sa kanyang paggalaw ay muling sumisilip ang kanyang bra sa likod ng blouse na parang mga batang naglalaro sa likod ng kurtina. “masarap sa pakiramdam, pero pumapatay pa rin s’ya ng tao. ilan taon n’yang dinibdib ‘yun. hanggang ngayon nararamdaman pa rin n’ya ang mga kamay ng tatay n’ya sa kanyang ari. sa kanyang dibdib. ilang taon bago n’ya matanggap ang ginawa n’ya. ngayon, medyo mahirap pa ring ikwento, pero kahit papaano’y kaya ko na. nangyari na kasi.” para bang may sumuntok sa aking dibdib nang marinig ko ‘to. bigla kong tinanggal ang aking paningin sa kanyang bra, at sa paggalaw ng aking mga mata’y bigla kong naramdaman ang pamumuo ng mga luha. “ayos lang, alex. pero andito lang ako. aalagaan ka muna namin. tapos pag handa ka na, makikinig ako. kahit pakonte-konte pa, ayos lang. aantayin kong mabuo ang kwento mo.” bumibilis bigla ang tibok ng puso ko. lalong nanginginig ang aking labi. at biglang pumasok si kuya sa isip ko, tumatakbo papalayo sa akin. mga bata pa kami, at hinahabol ko s’ya. “alex?” kuya wag kang lumayo! “alex?” kuya dito ka lang! kailangan kita dito! “sige, ayusin na natin pag-alis mo.” at parang isang batang nadapa sa semento, dito na walang awat na tumulo ang luha sa aking mga mata. “alex?” “hindi ko rin alam… hindi… ko rin alam. sorry, kuya! sorry! hindi ko rin alam kung bakit! patayin n’yo na lang ako! hindi ko alam anong nangyari! hindi ko na kaya!” lumalabo na ang aking paningin, pero kahit ga’no kalabo ang aking mga mata’y kitang-kita ko ang gulat at takot sa mukha ni abbie. pasensya ka na, kuya.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/nlygsa/alex_tanghaling_tapat_ng_sabado_2021/,27 05 2021
Tagalized - Morgue.,"may nakita akong isang ad sa dyaryo, hindi man ako maka-paniwala at kinilabutan pero nakaka-anyaya ang sinasabi. ""gusto mo bang kumita ng 1000 pesos per night bilang security sa morge? apply na!"" medyo matagal na rin akong walang trabaho at makaka-bayad na rin ako ng upa at makapa-mamumuhay ng maginhawa kung magkataon. kaya naman nag-apply ako kahit medyo nag-dalawang-isip, inaasahan ko nang hindi ako makaka-kuha ng kahit anong sagot mula sa kumpanya. pero wala pang dalawang oras ay may natanggap akong email mula sa employer: ""maraming salamat sa ipinasa mong application form para sa posisyong night guard sa morge. masaya kong ibinabalita na ang mga skills na iyong binanggit ay tugma para sa hinahanap namin sa isang guard at gusto kitang offeran ng isang taong kontrata. kung ika'y sumasang-ayon sa mga kasunduan sa ibaba, maari lamang mag-iwan ka ng signature online via e-signature na naka-lista sa baba at pumunta ka sa (redacted) eksakto alas diyes ngayong gabi. makaka-tanggap ka ng 5000 linggo-linggo na direkta sa iyong bangko."" ngayong gabi? hindi ba masaydong mabilis ang mga pangyayari? pero hindi na ako nag-reklamo o tanong pa. hindi ko alam kung anong aasahan o kung sino ang madadatnan ko doon, kaya sinuot ko na 'yung damit at pantalon ko at agad nagtungo sa nasabing address nang mas maaga sa itinakdang oras. nandoon na ako ng mga alas nwebe kwarenta 'y singko ng gabi at may isang middle aged na lalaki na mukhang nag-tatrabaho sa morge ang bumati sa akin. ""hi, michael, tama? ako nga pala si james."" - doon ay nag-kamayan kami at nag-kangitian - ""alam ko na pinapunta ka dito sa kabila ng maikling abiso, pero sadyang nanganga-ilangan ng bagong gwardiya ang kumpanya na nag-hire sa atin dito agad-agad para ngayong gabi.""

""ok. ano naman ang mga trabaho ko dito..."" pagsisimula ko. ""ahh, 'yun. wala naman gaano, siguraduhin mo lang na walang makakapasok."" - lumapit s'ya sa akin at sinabing - ""o labas."" isang maikling katahimikan at nagtinginan kaming dalawa, doon ay napa-ngiti ito at ang sabi: ""de, joke lang. so ayun, tapos na 'yung shift ko, kaya naman mauuna na ako. basta doon ka lang sa office at mag-relax hanggang alas sais ng umaga. doon darating na 'yung kahalili mo."" at doon nga ay umalis na s'ya. umupo ako sa upuan sa may office. akala ko siguro naman walang hindi magandang mangyayari. may papel sa harap ko at habang tinitignan ko ito ay doon ko lang napagtanto na ito ay listahan ng mga rules na specifically naka-asign sa akin. ito ang sabi: sa bagong gwardiya. welcome to the company. sa baba ay ang listahan ng mga rules para sa iyong trabaho: 1. ang una mong dapat gawin ay ang mag-conduct ng full sweep sa buong area para siguraduhin na walang kakaibang mga nangyayari liban sa ordinary (pati sa crypt). important note: kung may katawan man na naka-labas sa chambers sa loob ng crypt, itulak mo lamang ito pabalik. dapat manatili silang nasa-loob sa lahat ng pagkakataon. 2. matapos ang buong sweep, maari ka nang manatili sa loob ng office hanggang matapos ang shift mo. may iba pang mga rules na naka-lista sa baba, pero nag-desisyon akong libutin muna ang buong lugar. medyo may kaliitan ang morge, may isang malaking medical room na halos mapuno ng medical supplies ang loob. pero may sapat na espasyo para sa 2-3 lamesa na puwedeng pag-lagyan ng mga labi. sa loob ng crypt ay may palikuran. nag-desisyon akong unahin na ang pinaka-ayaw kong lugar - 'yung crypt. umalis na ako sa office at binuksan ang solid at napaka-bigat na pinto ng crypt, agad-agad ay sinalubong ako ng napaka-lamig na hangin. sa loob, may dalawang katawan sa gitna ng kwarto at mga chambers sa pader. lahat naman sila ay sarado kaya naman mabilis akong lumabas ng kwarto. habang pabalik ako mula sa bathroom, may nakita akong lalaki na naka lab coat na naka-tayo sa gitna ng medical room. parang may kinakalikot gamit ang mga medical tools malapit sa isang body bag. ""tang... tinakot mo naman ako boss."" - sabi ko. tinignan n'ya ako na parang wala lang at bumalik sa ginagawa nito. ""akala ko umuwi na ang lahat. ako nga pala si michael, bagong gwardiya."" - sabi ko, gaya ng nauna, hindi n'ya ako pinansin. kumaway na ako at umalis pabalik ng office. babasahin ko na sana ulit ang mga rules ng biglang may matinis na tunog akong narinig na para bang may bakal na kumi-kiskis sa isa pang bakal na nag-eecho sa buong building. medyo mahina na ito at parang nang-gagaling sa mga tubo. tumagal din iyon ng ilang segundo at huminto sa kaparehas na segundo. hindi ko na lang pinansin at i-idlip na lang, check ng cell phone. pero medyo tumatagal na ang tunog at habang mas kinikilabutan ako ay unti-unti nang nagbabago ang kanina'y parang bakal na kumi-kiskis sa isa't-isa ay naging... ungol. lumabas ako ng office at tatanungin ko sana 'yung kaninang naka lab coat pero mukhang naka-uwi na s'ya sa mga oras na 'yun. hindi ako sigurado kung saan mismo nang-gagaling ang tunog, pero parang sa may crypt, kaya naman pinuntahan ko ito. 'yung oras na binuksan ko ang pinto ay ang buong building ay nanahimik. huminga ako ng malalim at napansin ko na 'yung isang chambers ay naka-bukas na ng bahagya. tinulak ko ito pabalik at agad-agad na bumalik sa office. nawala na ng tuluyan ang matinis na na para bang ungol na iyon. nagpatuloy ako sa pagbabasa: 3. maari kang matulog sa office, pero dapat handa ka sa mga mangyayari. sleep at your own risk, ika nga nila. matapos nun ay isang napaka-lakas na tunog ang halos mag-patalon sa buong pagkatao ko. ""tulong! palabasin n'yo ako dito!"" - ang boses ay tila nang-gagaling sa mga tubo. tumayo ako habang sobra ang kalabog ng dibdib ko. ""palabasin n'yo ako, hindi ako maka-hinga!"" - paulit-ulit na pagmama-kaawa ng boses na ngayon ay may kasama ng kalabog. binuksan ko ang pintuan ng office at sa hindi malaman na dahilan sa crypt nang-gagaling ang boses. nanginginig, pero binuksan ko ang pinto. ""buhay pa ako, isa itong pagkakamali! tulong!"" - mas lalong lumakas ang boses nung oras na buksan ko ang napaka-bigat at solidong pinto. ""asan ka?!"" - nanginginig akong tumingin sa paligid, habang ang walang humpay na tumatawag ang boses na may kasamang malalakas na kalabog. lumapit ako at unti-unting inilapit ang tenga para maka-siguro na ang bubuksan ko ay ang tamang chamber. ""buhay pa ako! utang na loob! ple----"" ang boses at ang mga kalabog ay daglian na lamang nawala nang biglaan kong binuksan ang isa sa mga chambers at sinalubong ako ng malamig na bangkay ng isang middle-aged na lalaki. tumayo lang ako doon, nakatitig sa bangkay, halos tumigil sa pagtakbo ang isip ko sa kung ano ang mga nangyayari. malinaw na malinaw kong narinig at naramdaman ko ang bawat kalabog nung oras na hinawakan ko ang hawakan ng chamber at para bang may kung sino man na bigla-bigla na lang nagpatigil nito. pinaglalaruan lang ba ako ng aking isipan? tinulak ko ang chamber pabalik at mabilis na umalis doon, nilock ang pinto ng office. iniisip ko na ang pag-aaply sa trabahong 'to ay maaring isang malaking pagkakamali. pakiramdam ko na nababaliw na ako, pero agad ko ring kinumbinse ang sarili ko na nasa ulo ko lang lahat ng 'to. nagpatuloy ako sa pagbabasa ng mg rules: 4. puwede kang mag-patugtog para maibsan ang katahimikan basta't hindi ito makaka-kuha ng atensyon sa labas. 5. kung may marinig kang hindi mo maipaliwanag na ingay galing sa may crypt, 'wag mo na lamang ito pansinin. 6. kung ang mga ingay na 'yun ay naging sigaw ng pagpapanic, gawin ang mga sumusunod: • kung ang mga sigaw ay mula sa babae, 'wag mo pansinin hanggang sa tumigil ito.

Nakakapanghina.,"okay, this is gonna be a rant. kanina pa ko umiiyak. gusto ko lang ilabas emosyon ko. i just found out the issue about rappler. parang nanghihina katawan ko, ano ba nangyayari sa bansa natin?? i was once a dds, pero yung parents ko at mga relatives dds parin. as in, halos buong barangay namin puro dds. because of that, growing up i was conditioned to believe that all of duterte's critics are just biased towards the 'dilawans'. i always despise all those people because i thought they just don't understand his leadership. i hated rappler, abs-cbn, journalists like karen davila, up, activists, i also started labeling all those people who got red-tagged as npa. when maria ressa recieved her nobel peace prize, i laughed–because i thought the western world don't know anything about her being biased. i thought she doesn't deserve that medal because she's a 'bayarang' journalist and the freedom of speech in this country is not even at risk. this election has opened my eyes so much. i started seeing the problems in our country more objectively. nakita ko kung paano kabulok yung sistema natin, pati narin yung kamalian at kapalpakan ng administrasyong ito. i saw how duterte made this country so divisive. that's why i rooted for vp leni to win. months ago, i was full of hope. i always look forward to the news updating about her campaign. i even convinced my parents to vote for her (kasi hindi pa ako makakaboto) kahit nag-aaway na kami, pero ayaw parin talaga nila. kaya nung natalo siya umiyak talaga ako. antagal kong maka-move on. when june came, i was in my acceptance stage. naisip ko siguro may plano ang diyos, siguro sa loob ng six years magigising yung mga tao at maisip nilang nagkamali sila, o baka siguro makansela yung coc ni 88m at si leni talaga yung uupong presidente. pero ngayon, nakakapanlumo. yesterday, it was announced that marcos jr's dq cases were all dismissed. and now, sec ordered to shut down rappler. what's more heartbreaking is that these past few months i found myself actually enjoying the content i consume from rappler. i've been reading lots of their articles–especially, their editorials, and also binge watching all their tiktok videos. and then i thought to myself, all those things i said about them were actually the result of being a fanatic towards duterte. they are the ones who are the most critical in this administration, they are also one of those news sites who really provides so much analysis whenever there's a political issue surfacing. just earlier i went to social media, and guess what?? people were celebrating. they said rappler deserves it because of being bias. hindi man lang nila naisip na siguro may paglabag na ito sa kalayaang pamamahayag. their logic is basically, ""if you're bias/criticize our president, then you deserve to be shut down"". nakakaputangina😭😭 'yung una abs, ngayon rappler naman. ano ba susunod? i know i don't deserve this kind of government. gusto kong lumaking malayang pinapahayag ang pananalita ko nang hindi natatakot. ano bang kasalanan ko bakit dito pa talaga ako sa impyernong bansa to ipinanganak?! nakakapagod na😭😭 as you can see, journalists, activists and the opposition were now all demonized because of pdutz. red-tagging is everywhere, vloggers who spread fake news are being prioritized, people who critize this administration are harrassed in social media, those covicted politicians from previous admin were freed meanwhile leila de lima–a known critic of duterte is still in the prison, and don't forget the militirization of up campuses. as much as i can remember, at the time of pnoy all these things don't even exist despite of many backlash from the people. before, there was this thing called ""freedom of speech"" wala na talaga pagasa bansa natin. gusto kong umalis pero wala naman akong pera tapos minor de edad pa. tangina mo duterte!! tangina mo marcos!! tangina nyo 31m!! tangina niyo mga panatiko!! tagina lahat ng mga pulitikong bayaran!! good luck na lang talaga sa six years😭😭😭",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/vn93po/nakakapanghina/,29 06 2022
Naturopathic Medicine in Philippines,"so. we have this client na “doctor” ng naturopathic medicine. she’s old na like mga nasa early 70’s. wayback pre pandemic (february 2020) sinabi niya na etong corona virus is a “scare tactics” daw para kumita yung malalaking medical company. she also added “sa china kasi madaming mahihirap kaya madaming malnourished thence spreading the virus” so naisip ko rin na baka nga vitamins lang katapat. the pandemic and lockdown happened. may meeting kami sa kanya and she gives us this silver colloidal naka boteng maliliit and isang 6 gallon na lalagyan. i dont think na fda approved and registered yon. i also researched na may adverse side effects yon. pinapainom niya sa amin yon and she claimed na wala daw side effects. but we insist. yung 6 gallon na lalagyan, ayun wala pa sa kalahati apat na buwan na. hahahh napaisip talaga ako kung doctor ba talaga siya nung sinabi niya during meeting na “wag kayo magsusuot ng face mask kasi masama yon. naiinhale lang din yung carbon dioxide sa katawan” yup as same as dj loonyo’s comment. how come na “doctor” sya tapos magcocomment sya ng ganon? the news broke out about sa use ng hydrochloroquine on treating covid. and guess what? meron syang bote na maliit (kasing laki ng lalgyanan ng essential oil pang air diffuser) non. i don’t know kung saan niya pinag kukuha yon haha. also di rin nakawala yung ivermectin. i’ve seen her sharing post sa fb good things about it. pinagtatanggol niya talaga ang ivermectin. binigyan nya yung mga ksamahan ko isang banig. ang nakakabahala pa don, sa banig ng gamot na yon, walang ni isang letter na nakasulat. yup as in yung aluminum lang ang makikita mo sa likod. wala rin labels sa mismong tablet. vaccine? of course. wala. hahaha. pero sinabi niya. in a drop-dead-serious face “oy kayo, wag kayong magpapabakuna ah” like sabi ko sa isip ko p*tangina doctor ka ba talaga? i get it naman na she’s into natural medicine. but there are some things na separate sa natural med from modern medicine. i just found out na walang “md” sa titles niya. ibig sabihin it is illegal na mag practice sya ng medicine. (please correct me on this if i’m wrong) p.s. she’s connected sa company na nagbebenta ng products like silver colloidal na nagsisimula sa letter z.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/n0h6jv/naturopathic_medicine_in_philippines/,28 04 2021

"Sorry, but I think the internet is indeed a factor why many people are ""depressed"" right now, BUT that's not necessarily a bad thing.","so i saw this short clip on facebook. galing siya sa isang film featuring tony labrusca. tony told her mom he's depressed, and the mom went ballistic, saying shits like depression is just a trend online. while i don't believe that depression is a trend, i do think the internet is also a reason why more and more middle-class people claim they're depression. sa palagay ko, ito ay parehong panget at mabuti -- pero mas matimbang ang mabuti kesa panget. let's talk about why is it a bad thing first. simple lang: some people might misinterpret this validation, and rather than dealing with their pains, they became addicted to it and became their sort of comfort. kumbaga, the internet validation became a new form of addiction -- gaya ng kung bakit may mga nalululong sa online games, pagkain, at droga. i've observed this a lot in the west. halimbawa nga, some of them gets offended with the word ""fat"" or ""obese"". dapat daw plus-size or the new sexy ang tawag para di masakit sa pandinig. see? rather than dealing with their insecurity, they resorted to demonizing an adjective, and that's a bad thing. nagiging eggshell na ang mga tao, all for the sake of not offending someone who has issues. now, let's talk about the good thing. syempre, unang-una dyan ang validation ulit. gaya rin ng pagkain, online games, and even drugs, wala naman talagang masama sa validation *as long as* you know your limit. most of you probably already know sugar is addicting, and is probably more addicting than marijuana, but hey, we don't hear people asking to ban sugar. even nutritionists themselves aren't saying that. ang lagi lang nilang sinasabi ay hinay-hinay lang. if you consumed it moderately, sobrang helpful iyon sa katawan mo especially if you're physically active. ganoon din sa validation. maraming middle class/rich kid na lumaki sa toxic positivity mindset. because of this, their frustrations were forced to repress simply because someone had it worse. pinagdaanan ko rin ito, sa totoo lang. my grandma loves to tell me na swerte ako dahil marino si papa at malaki ang sahod kaya hindi ko naranasan maghirap noon. anong naging epekto sakin? i was forced to conceal my angsts. dahil hindi ko mailabas, naipon lang nang naipon sa dibdib ko. parang naging time bomb siya, and it exploded in 2019, after my break-up with my long-term boyfriend. i felt so miserable. i'm still dealing with numbness and suicidal ideation until now. mabuti na lang, i have a good support group. gusto ko sanang mag-therapy pero ayoko kasi ng epekto ng gamot sakin, so i chose not to seek it. what could have happened if iba ang upbringing ko? i probably would have a better coping mechanism. right now, my coping mechanism is being workaholic, since it helps me distract myself from pain, pero hindi rin maganda ito. dami ko ngang pera pero di naman ako masaya sa buhay ko. that's why right now, i'm learning to balance my social life and work. heck, pati sex life and fitness, i'm slowly incorporating it to my lifestyle. isa pang bagay na maganda sa awareness ng mental health online ay yung mapuputol na natin ang siklo. let's admit it, one of the reasons why the gen xers and the generation earlier romanticized hard work and abuses so much is because ganoon sila pinaniwala. kaya nga karamihan sa mga toxic boss at customer ay mga galing sa henerasyon na ito. karamihan sa kanila ay mayroong anger management issue. naalala ko nga sa first job ko, i was bullied by my workmates, who are mostly 40+ and older. natutuwa kasi boss namin sakin dahil mabilis ako magtrabaho, and these people saw me as a threat, so they're bullying me through cold treatment. tapos lagi pa akong pinagchichismisan, at hindi rin ako sinasabihan kapag may announcement. it’s affecting my job a lot. so iyon, umalis ako after six months. nagalit si tita ko sakin, saying i should just shrug it off. imagine, rather than saying ang toxic ng ka-work ko, ako pa ang mali? but then, iyon kasi ang kinagisnan nilang buhay. through the mh awareness, the younger generation can break this cycle. we learn to be kinder and be less tolerant to bullshit like this, and i think that’s the best part. after all, bukod sa mali naman talaga ang bullying, counterproductive din ito, lalo na sa office. halimbawa na nga lang itong experience ko sa first work ko. natutuwa si boss sakin because i’m efficient. that efficiency decreased because of the bullying. remember, from an economic perspective, productivity loss will also result in income loss, which sadly many insecure coworkers didn’t know. hindi lang ako ang apektado kundi ang kumpanyang pinagtratrabahuhan nila. in the long run, sila rin ang maapektuhan sa ganitong kultura. and speaking of efficiency, mh awareness also improves it. think about it: hindi ka makakapagtrabaho nang matino kung burnt out ka, hindi ba? and this is not just anecdotal evidence. years ago, microsoft japan conducted a study to know what would happen if they implement a 4-day work system. japan is notorious for their overworking culture, so this is frowned upon. and surprisingly, mas malaki pa ang income nila during the time 4-day work happens. mas productive ang mga tao dahil hindi sila masyadong pagod. hindi rin uso yung pinapabagal ang trabaho para lang mapagkasya ng eight hours ang pwede sanang gawin within 3-4 hour. and nakatipid pa sila sa operating expenses dahil tatlong araw na walang gumagamit ng office. see? efficient, and it all started because microsoft is trying to improve the mental health state of their employees. the verdict? the internet does play a factor on why more people are self-diagnosing. but if you think about it, the benefits outweigh the liability. hindi lang natin natutulungan ang mga tao, but it would also improve the economy. it’s a win-win suggestion. recommendation? normalize validating your pain, but don’t overdo it as it would lead to addiction in the long run.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/oco9gn/sorry_but_i_think_the_internet_is_indeed_a_factor/,3 07 2021

""be aware huwag kayong maniwala dyan sa vaccine nayan. automatic na magpa- positive ka sa covid pag tinest kahit walang sakit. yan raw ang pinasa sa congress dito. malapit na nila ilabas ang vaccine ngayon na may microchip. huwag kayong magpapa- vaccine pag lumabas nayan dyan sa pinas, kasi ibang klaseng needles ang ginagamit tulad sa europe na my microchip. ipakalat at ipaalam nyo sa lahat ng mga kaanak nyo... hindi yan biro, itong virus ang way nila para ma implement ang microchip... yan ang makikita pag mag oopen ng website, ng us. nakakatakot yan pag napasa na. ... pwede na silang basta pumasok sa loob ng bahay mo, pag nag mandatory nayan... tiyak, magkakaroon ng war dito sa us. dahil maraming against sa mandatory. sa canada, sapilitang pumupunta sa bahay para pilitin ang mga tao na ma test ng covid. pag mangyari yan, lahat na bansa susunod na. may nag test na niyan dito gamit ang papaya fruit at nagka positive ang papaya sa covid. ito ang sinasabi na bawasan ang bilyon bilyong tao sa mundo. mga kampon sila ng diablo, lahat ng testing kits galing sa us, kaya ang mga tao di na naniwala sa numbers of covid. yung dr. fuchi na nagsabi na my vaccine na para sa covid, kasabwat siya ni bill gates. si bill gates ang punot dulo ng lahat ng virus nayan. pastor kasi siya sa illuminati, isang devil church. siya ang gumawa ng covid virus at dinala sa china at pag kumalat na sa buong mundo, siya na din ang maglalabas ng vaccine, panlaban sa virus. plano na nila yan lahat dahil ito ang nakasulat sa revelation. mostly, lahat na nga ng tao dito, may baril kaya pag mag mamandatory nayan dito sa us, war talaga ang mangyaryari. yung mga doctors mismo ang nagsabi na di maganda ang vaccine sa katawan dahil puro chemicals ang ingredients at my biochip. may mga videos na dinidelete na sa youtube, para hindi na mapanood ng mga tao. basahin nyo agad ito, bago nila burahin... dahil lahat ng information about sa gamot ng china virus, o sa plano ng ""who"" at ""doh"" ,at ng mga gobyerno... pinabubura agad nla."" pls forward...",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/nmlku1/sample_ng_fake_news_na_nakalat_sa_fb_messenger/,28 05 2021

&#x200b; ang tinutukoy kong mga ""rules"" ay mga simpleng observations ko lamang sa kanya. mga bagay na hindi naman niya ipinagbabawal o dine-demand pero mas maganda kung alam mo. ito ang susi ng aming napakasaya at very smooth na relationship. hindi ba't may kasabihan tayo na, ""ang nagsasama nang matapat at sumusunod sa mga rules ng girlfriend niya, nagsasama nang maluwat."" &#x200b; heto ang mga simpleng rules kaya't perfect ang relationship namin ng aking perfect girlfriend. konti lang naman sila: &#x200b; rule #1. ayaw na ayaw ng girlfriend ko ang mga simbahan. hindi kasi siya religious at ang sabi niya, na-trauma raw siya dahil pinalaki siya ng kanyang lola na super relihiyosa. isa yatang panatiko ang lola niya na miyembro ng isang religious group sa probinsya nila na masasabing parang kulto na nga. kaya't kapag nakakakita siya ng mga churches (kahit anong religion), parang sumasama ang pakiramdam niya. isang beses nga, dumaan ako sa isang kalsada na hindi pamilyar sa akin. ang sabi kasi ng ka-opisina ko, shortcut daw iyon. kaya hindi ko alam na mayroon palang simbahang dadaanan. pagdaan na pagdaan ng kotse ko sa tapat ng simbahan, biglang nagtitili ang girlfriend ko. nagpupumiglas siya, parang nasasaktan ang buong katawan. grabeng trauma siguro ang sinapit niya sa kamay ng lola niya kaya ganoon ang reaksyon niya. kaya binilisan ko ang pagpapatakbo ng kotse ko hanggang sa makalayo kami roon. saka lamang siya huminahon. umiiyak siya, humihingi ng sorry. naiintindihan ko naman siya, wala siyang kasalanan. biktima lamang siya. hinaplos ko ang kanyang buhok at pinunasan ang kanyang mga luha. doon ko lang napansin na namumula ang kanyang noo at mga pisngi. pati mga braso niya ay namumula rin. nang pansinin ko ito, ang sabi niya ay baka nauntog siya o naihampas ang mga braso sa dashboard o sa bintana noong nagpupumiglas siya. niyaya ko siyang dalhin sa ospital pero tumanggi siya. sasabihin ko sanang imposibleng nauntog siya dahil hindi naman mukhang mga pasa ang nasa kanyang mukha at mga braso kundi mukha itong parang nasunog ngunit bigla siyang ngumiti, ang kanyang perpektong mga ngiti, kaya't nakumbisi na rin ako na okay na siya. pagkauwi namin, wala nang anumang bakas sa kanyang mukha na nauntog siya. &#x200b; kaya't kapag bumabiyahe kami, kailangang planuhin ang rutang dadaanan namin at siguraduhing hindi kami malalapit sa anumang simbahan. &#x200b; rule #2. hindi kumakain ng gulay ang girlfriend ko. siguro naman, marami sa inyo ganito ang mga girlfriend. mahilig sa meat pero ayaw kumain ng gulay. nakakatuwa, hindi ba? ako rin naman hindi masyadong mahilig sa gulay. kaya't kung kakain kami o lalabas, laging meat ang kinakain namin. hilig nga niya 'yung mga unli na barbecue. lalo na 'yung mayroong mga lamanloob. paboritong-paborito niya ang atay, intestines, puso, utak, at kung anu-ano pa. mahilig din siya sa dinuguan. minsan nga, isinama niya ako sa isang exclusive restaurant. mga members lang daw ang pwedeng kumain doon at miyembro siya at ang kanyang mga parents. nasa isang subdivision ito na puro mayayaman lamang ang nakatira. sa labas, mukha lang itong malaking mansyon pero pagpasok mo, isa pala itong restaurant. grabe, mayayaman talaga ang mga kumakain doon. may nakita pa nga akong mga artista at mga pulitiko. &#x200b; ang specialty ng restaurant na iyon ay mga lamanloob. tuwang-tuwa ang girlfriend ko nang orderin niya ang soup number 5. pinakain niya sa akin iyon at pinaubos dahil aphrodisiac daw iyon. masaya ko namang sinunod ito kahit na first time ko kumain noon. excited din ako dahil siguradong mapapalaban ako sa mangyayaring bakbakan pagkauwi namin. medyo natigilan lang ako noong una kong makita. ang alam ko kasi, ang main ingredient ng soup number 5 ay ari at bayag ng isang kalabaw. pero, noong pagsandok ko, parang iba ang nakita ko. parang iba ang hugis, parang malapit sa tao. pero siyempre, hindi ko na 'yun pinansin at siguradong imahinasyon ko lamang iyon. &#x200b; rule #3. hindi mahilig magpa-picture at mag-selfie ang aking girlfriend. ayaw na ayaw niya na kuhanan siya ng litrato, lalo na kung stolen. kaya nga kapag lumalabas kami, lagi siyang naka-cap at naka-long sleeves na jacket na may hoodie (ayaw niya rin kasi ang naaarawan). noong bago pa lamang kami, sinubukan ko siyang kuhanan ng picture nang palihim. pagtingin ko, nagtaka ako dahil parang deformed ang hitsura niya sa larawan. ni-restart ko ang phone ko at inulit pero ganoon pa rin. kaya tumabi ako sa kanya at mabilis na kumuha ng selfie. grabe ang galit niya sa akin! pinagsusuntok niya ako pero tinanggap ko ang lahat hanggang sa mawala ang galit niya. mga six months din bago ko nakita 'yung picture sa phone ko. inabot din kasi ng six months bago natanggal ang cast sa mga braso at binti ko. &#x200b; pagtingin ko sa picture na kinuha ko (kinuha ng girlfriend ko 'yung cellphone ko at itinago pero nakita ko rin naman sa closet niya noong makalabas ako sa ospital), naguluhan ako sa nakita ko. sa larawan, nakatingin ako sa camera at nakangiti. sa tabi ko, may isang matandang babae ang nakaupo. kulubot na ang kanyang mga mukha at kulay abo na ang mga buhok. suot-suot niya ang favorite t-shirt ng nobya ko. &#x200b; napailing na lang ako sa nakita ko. bilib na bilib pa naman ako sa camera ng iphone pero mukhang nagma-malfunction din pala ito. kaya ngayon, samsung na ang telepono ko. hindi ko na rin kinuhanan pa ng litrato ang girlfriend ko. &#x200b; rule #4. huwag magpapakita ng kabaitan sa ibang mga babae. ops! baka isipin niyo na selosa at mahigpit ang girlfriend ko. naku, diyan po kayo nagkakamali. sa katunayan, ayos lang sa kanya na makipagkaibigan ako sa mga babae. hindi siya nagagalit o nagtatampo. naalala ko nga noon, mayroon akong naging kaibigang babae sa trabaho, si carla. siyempre, tayong mga lalaki, natural na friendly tayo sa mga kababaihan. accomodating tayo at mahilig magbiro at mag-joke. madalas tuloy ay pinaghihinalaan tayo ng ating mga girlfriends. pero, iba ang girlfriend ko. ayos lang sa kanya ang ganoon. kahit nakikita niyang magkasama kami ni carla at nagtatawanan kapag bumibisita siya sa office, hindi siya nagagalit. nakakalungkot nga lang na hindi na natin kapiling si carla ngayon. natagpuan na lang siya isang umaga sa kuwarto niya, patay na. noong bumisita ako sa burol niya, nasabi sa akin ng kapatid niya na na-overdose daw sa gamot si carla. pagpasok daw nila sa kuwarto niya, nakita nila si carla na nakahiga sa kama, bumubula ang bibig. sa tabi niya, maraming nagkalat na gamot. puro tusok din ng karayom ang buong katawan niya. marahil daw, dahil sa depresyon o anumang mental illness, tinusok-tusok ni carla ang sarili niya ng karayom at pagkatapos ay uminom ng maraming gamot. ang nakapagtataka lamang daw, wala silang nakitang anumang karayom sa kuwarto ni carla. &#x200b; gaya nga ng sabi ko, hindi selosa ang girlfriend ko. marami akong mga naging kaibigang babae. nandyan si cherry na dating classmate ko noong college. marahil ay nakita mo siya sa balita. isang gabi kasi, habang papauwi galing trabaho, may tumulak daw sa kanya kaya nasagasaan siya ng isang bus. naging close ko rin si june at si barbie. kaso lang, maaga silang kinuha ni lord. bigla na lang silang na-comatose at hindi na nagising. over-fatigued daw sabi ng mga doktor. &#x200b; inaasar nga ako ng mga kaibigan ko ngayon na under daw ako ng girlfriend ko kaya hindi ako nakikipagkaibigan sa mga babae. pero ayos lang naman sa akin. mas masaya akong tawaging under kaysa naman magkaroon ng mga babaeng kaibigan pagkatapos... &#x200b; rule #5. kapag nagising ka sa madaling araw at nakita si girlfriend na naghahanap ng pagkain at mukhang gutom na gutom, magtago sa closet o kaya'y tumalon sa bintana. nakakatawa itong experience na ito. bakit ba ang mga babae, laging gutom? tapos, kapag pinakain mo masaya na kaagad sila? &#x200b; nagising ako isang beses mga alas-tres 'yata iyon. may narinig kasi akong mga kalampag kaya bumangon ako. wala rin kasi si girlfriend sa tabi ko. sa kusina ko siya nakita, hinahalughog ang ref namin. kaso, hindi pa kami nakakapag-grocery dahil wala pang sahod. &#x200b; tiningnan niya ako, nakakunot ang noo niya. ""gutom na ako,"" sabi niya. kahit gutom, sobrang ganda pa rin niya. kaya hindi ko napansin na tumutulo na pala ang laway niya. &#x200b; siyempre, ayokong nagugutom ang girlfriend ko kaya agad akong tumawag para magpa-deliver. pero, hindi na nakapagpigil pa ang girlfriend ko. sobrang gutom na siya, eh. kaya, ayun! &#x200b; pagkatapos niyang kumain, sobrang saya na niya. &#x200b; anyways, naging maayos naman ang lahat. ngayon, alam ko na ang gagawin kapag nakita siyang ganoon kaya wala naman na kaming naging problema pa. at saka, pwede namang mabuhay na isa lang ang kidney mo, hindi ba? basta't sisiguraduhin ko lang na hindi na ito mauulit pa. nag-iisa na lang ang natitira, eh. &#x200b; oh, napakadali lamang namang tandaan, 'di ba? 'yung ibang girlfriend diyan, napaka-demanding, ang dami-daming gusto, ang dami-daming ayaw. pero girlfriend ko, simple lang. simple pero perfect. kaya napakasaya ko sa kanya, eh. hindi ko na siya papakawalan. at siguradong-sigurado ako na hinding-hindi na niya ako papakawalan. &#x200b; edit: sa mga nagco-comment po at concerned sa akin, huwag po kayong mag-alala. ayos lang po ako. masaya, rewarding, at healthy ang relationship naming dalawa. oo, aaminin ko na medyo underweight ako ngayon nang kaunti (malnourished daw sabi ng doktor pero ano ba namang alam ng doktor? gusto lang akong pagka-perahan 'nun, eh!). medyo napapadalas din akong atakihin ng anemia (although hindi naman ako anemic dati, weird). pero, overall, perfect and happy kaming dalawa. &#x200b; tunay na love ko ang girlfriend ko!!! &#x200b; please subscribe to my pinoy horror animation channel!!! yt: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnaflx-rcdu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnaflx-rcdu)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/oiwuig/perpekto_ang_girlfriend_ko_basta_susundin_mo_lang/,12 07 2021
First Day nang GCQ,"gusto ko lang makwento yung naobserbahan ko sa unang araw nang gcq sa manila. gusto ko lang ipaalam na behavior nang kapwa natin yung sasabihin ko dito. hindi yung ginagawa nang lgus and national government other topic yun. and madami naman nadin nagbigay ng kanya kanyang opinyon ukol dun. mix race tayo and nakuha natin yan sa mga sumakop satin na iba't ibang bansa, kaya nadin siguro iba iba ugali at pananaw natin. pero malaking part nito is asian country tayo na may western mindset. yun nga lang nakuha natin is karamihan bad traits. una nag karoon na nang pandemic at lahat madami na namatay. hindi parin tayo marunong mag tapon sa tamang tapunan o basurahan, may nag kalat na pastic at facemask na gamit kunsan san. pangalawa wala parin tayo respeto sa isa't isa. nag uunahan parin sa pila, nag cucut sa traffic and napaka raming nag roroad rage. pangatlo madami parin ayaw or hindi marunong sumunod tulad nang mga una kong nasabi. hindi sumusunod sa linya, mga ugali na kailangan sila masunod at pag hindi nasunod nagagalit sa mga nag eenforce, ang daming hindi nag faface mask halos 3 sa kada 10 nag bibike, nag cocommute or mga nasa labas ang hindi nag faface mask. kung wala kayong pag aalaga sa katawan nyo isipin nyo nalang yung mga tao na ginagawa ang lahat para maging healthy sila at makauwi sa pamilya nang walang dalang sakit. ang malala hindi mo pwedeng pag sabihan kasi pag pinagsabihan mo o pinaalalahanan mo nagagalit pa sila. i know na maraming pwedeng tamaan nito pero realtalk hindi maganda ang nagiging mindset nating mga pilipino. hindi nagiging maganda pakikipag kapwa tao natin. ni walang respeto sa isa't isa. gusto ko malaman opinyon nyo dito guys bakit ganto tayo hanggang ngayon at sa tingin nyo pano natin masosolve yung nagiging cancer natin mga ugali.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/guia5g/first_day_nang_gcq/,1 06 2020

Midnight Memories.,"alas dose 'y media nang hating-gabi na iyon at papasok na ako sa trabaho. *sa fx* isang magandang babae ang sumakay at naupo sa tabi ko. mabango at kahit medyo madilim sa loob ng fx ay litaw ang ganda n'ya. maya-maya pa ay medyo napa-sandal na s'ya sa balikat ko. - babae: ""ayy.. sorry."" *hinawi ang buhok pataas at nahikab*. ako: *ngumiti at tumango bilang pag-tanggap sa sorry nito*. ilang minuto pa ang nag-daan ay naramdaman kong napapa-sandal na naman s'ya sa balikat ko. napa-tingin ako sa balikat ko at tiniti-tigan ko o ina-abangan kung matu-tuluyan bang mahihiga s'ya sa balikat ko. hindi ko alam kung anong tuwa ang nararamdaman ko noong mga panahon na iyon, pero ang alam ko, masaya ako sa mga nangyayari. maya-maya pa nga ay tuluyan nang nahiga sa balikat ko ang babae kaya naman hinayaan ko na lamang. lumipas pa ang halos tatlumpong-minuto at papalapit na ako sa aking bababaan, pero hindi pa rin nagigising ang babae. kaya naman... - ako: ""madame? miss?"" babae: *medyo nagulat at parang naalimpungatan*. ako: *naka-ngiti* ""sorry. pero, kasi bababa na ako e."" babae: *nag sink-in na ata 'yung nangyari* ""ayyy... hala!! sorry kuya."" *napa-facepalm at hinagod ang buhok pataas* ""sorry talaga kuya."" ako: *ngumiti lang at tumango*. maya-maya pa nga ay pumara na ako at akmang tatayo nang napansin ko na kumikilos na rin ang babae na para bang bababa na rin. hindi nga ako nag-kamali. dahil noong huminto na ang fx ay bumaba na rin ang babae. habang nag-lalakad kami ay hindi ko mapigilang mapa-ngiti dahil maaring mag-kalapit lang ang aming pinag-tatrabahuhan o sa iisang building lang kami at iba lang ang kumpanya. hindi ko alam kung anong nangyayari, pero parang hindi ako maka-hinga na nilalamig na nangiginig na nang-hihina na ewan. hindi ko ma-ipaliwanag ang halo-halong nararamdaman ko sa mga oras na iyon. sa sobrang pag-iisip ko ng mga nararamdaman ko ay hindi ko namalayan nawala na pala s'ya sa paningin ko. kaya naman inikot ko ang aking paningin, pero hindi ko na s'ya makita. hindi ako makapag-focus sa trabaho noong gabing iyon dahil hindi mawala sa isip ko ang maganda n'yang mukha. simple lang s'ya, oo. pero, may kakaiba akong naramdaman na hindi ko ma-ipaliwanag. ilang linggo na rin ang nag-daan pero hindi ko na s'ya nakita pa sa fx o kahit saan pa sa pag-lalakad ko sa lugar malapit sa office namin. halos ala-una na noon at kaka-para ko lang ng fx. papa-upo na sana ako ng may biglang may sumunod na sumakay at tumabi sa akin. sa isang iglap tila baga'y tumigil ang mundo ko at ang mga kakatuwang pakiramdam ko noong una ko s'yang nakita ay isa-isang nagbabalikan. sa wakas. ang babaeng ilang linggo ko ring hinanap, muli ay katabi ko ulit. halos hindi ko mapigilan ang pangi-nginig nang katawan ko noong mga oras na iyon. hindi ko alam anong gagawin. (inner monologue: ""sir, kalma ka lang. hingang malalim, dahan-dahang exhale. ayaw mo naman siguro maamoy 'yan ng magandang babae sa tabi mo? tama? kalma. inhale-exhale. pakalmahin mo 'yang sarili mo sir, baka mahalata ka. ang pangi-nginig, kalmahan mo lang sir. kalma."") unti-unti nga ay napa-kalma ko rin ang sarili ko. pero hindi pa rin mawala ang mga kakatuwang pakiramdlam sa loob ko. habang nasa byahe at katabi ko s'ya ay hindi ko mapigilang mapa-tingin sa tabi ko. aaminin ko, umaasa ako na sana antukin s'ya, pero... hehe. mukhang naparami ata ang inom n'ya ng kape at hindi s'ya inaantok. sayang. ang quarenta 'y singkong byahe na iyon ay tila ba'y naging dalawa o tatlong oras. hindi ko alam bakit... hindi ko talaga alam. hanggang ngayon ay nangiginig na kinakapos pa rin ako ng hininga kapag naa-alala ko iyon. (madaling araw kasi, tsaka, medyo malamig dahil sa habagat. hehe). matapos nga ang halos tatlong oras... ay, quarenta 'y singko lang pala na byaheng iyon ay hindi ko na hahayaang mawala s'ya sa paningin ko ng hindi ko nalalaman kung saang kumpanya s'ya nag-tatrabaho. para hindi halata na naghihintay ako ay medyo pina-una ko muna s'ya mag-lakad at kunyari'y nag-sintas muna ako ng aking sapatos. nang nakita kong naglalakad na s'ya ay agad-agad naman akong lumakad sa hindi kalayuan. unti-unti ay parang mas bumibilis ang tibok ng dibdib ko at mas lumalakas ang pangi-nginig ng buong katawan ko na halos nang-hihina na hindi ko maintindihan. ilang minuto pa ang naka-lipas ay nakita ko s'yang papasok na sa isang building na halos tatlong kanto lang ang layo kung saan ako nag-tatrabaho. ngayon, alam ko na kung saan s'ya nag-tatrabaho. kaya naman binilisan ko na ang pag-lalakad dahil male-late na ako. ilang araw din akong naghintay at umasang makaka-sabay ko s'ya sa fx, pero, nga-nga. wala na naman. alas-dose 'y medya na noon ng tanghali at naglalakad na ako papunta sa bus terminal. pagdating ko sa terminal ay doon sa upuan nag-seselpon ang isang magandang babae. sa hindi kalayuan ay naka-tayo lang ako at nag-mamasid. nahuhuli ko ang sarili ko na naka-titig sa kanya na para bang s'ya lang ang babae o tao sa paligid ko. para bang lahat ng nasa paligid ko ay unti-unting lumalabo at s'ya lang ang nakikita ko. maya't-maya rin ang lingon ko sa paligid-ligid dahil baka isipin ng mga tao na mina-manyak ko na ang babae sa dating ng titig ko. maya-maya pa ay dumating na ang bus na sasakyan ko. medyo punuan noon dahil tanghali at nasa kala-gitnaan ng metro manila ang kumpanya namin. kaya naman, pagdating ng mga bus sa terminal ay halos wala ka nang mauupuan pa. gaya ng inaasahan, parang mga zombie na nag-takbuhan ang mga tao papa-lapit sa bus. bilang hindi naman ako nag-mamadali at rd (rest day) ko naman bukas, hindi na ako nakipag-digmaan pa sa bukana nang pinto ng bus. umalis na nga ang bus at tsaka lang pumasok sa isip ko ang babae. (inner monologue: sir?! anong ginagawa mo?! wala na. naka-sakay na 'yun. bob* naman natin e. ano? ilang linggo ulit 'yan? tang* put*. wala na). anak nang!!! nawala sa isip ko ang babaeng halos apat na buwan ko na ring sinusubay-bayan. (hinihintay o ina-abangan, panget kasi na term e. parang may balak akong masama). 😅 pagka-alis nga ng bus ay wala na rin sa kina-uupuan nito ang babae.

Beware of PNEUMONIA,"as a father of 3...akala ko expert na ko sa lahat ng sakit ng bata. hindi namin dinadala sa hospital kasi mababa lang naman lagnat at pawala wala pa. hindi sya nag tatae so hindi din dehydrated. we ruled out dengue and amoeba as well. little did we know, our little one is having rsv na pala. common ubo't sipon (na usong uso ngayon) pero sa lungs ang atake and pneumonia agad. he's only 3yrs old, pandemic baby so hindi sanay sa tao.. imagine leaving him alone sa icu surrounded by nurses and doctors he doesn't know.. it's heartbreaking. symtoms ang things to look out/do for so you can avoid our mistakes: - nose flaring - tignan ang tyan kung may struggle sa pag hinga - if you have o2 finger reader mas okay - a simple online consultation with your doctor sana would suffice, antibiotics lang sana sapat na - we are self employed so walang hmo, get some one time er use card or something.. or apply for your own hmo kahit sa mga bata lang - mag pa flu shot na buong pamilya pag flu season just today, i found out about a colleague who passed away due to rsv pneumonia as well 😢 he was younger than me.",https://i.redd.it/iz1b02gq3m4c1.jpg,6 12 2023
My proposal is penalized individuals na lumabas na meron symptoms as a priority vs unvaccinated,"nanoticed ko na our government is now starting to punish individuals who are unvaccinated pero hindi ba ang unvaccinated ang dehado? they have the biggest risk right now if they go out, giving them more chances to get severe case of covid. pero tayong vaccinated, less chances of severe type of covid. not zero chance of covid. and everyone is still a potential carrier of the disease. pero i can see a lot of people working right now sa labas na may sipon at ubo. eto ung nakakaspread ng sakit pero no one is telling them sa bahay po muna kayo magquarantine kasi baka covid yan at nakakahawa. hindi ba mas dapat ipriority ito vs unvaccinated. or do a proper marketing sa pinas, if may sipon or ubo or trankaso, ok lang na di muna pumasok or wag ka na lumabas muna. ang sipon at ubo at pedeng makahawa ng iba, blah blah. alam ko turo ng mga magulang or prof natin dati, ubo sipon lang yan, kung sila nga mamatay na kayod parin para lang mabuhay or pumasok sa school etc. pero it's not the mentality na you are weak for not working or going to school but because you can be a carrier that can infect more people. edit: best explanation why we are encouraging vaccination to the unvax: https://www.reddit.com/r/philippines/comments/s3lvv3/my_proposal_is_penalized_individuals_na_lumabas/hslons9/ why providing sick leave is important and the current situation sa country natin why di mabigyan basta basta: https://www.reddit.com/r/philippines/comments/s3lvv3/my_proposal_is_penalized_individuals_na_lumabas/hsloul0/ also i want to clarify that i didn't post this to discourage people from getting vaccinated. get vaccinated if hindi ka pa vaccinated. this will prevent you from getting too sick or die from covid. magastos magkasakit. but the increase in numbers in covid right now isn't caused by the unvaccinated people but people who go out with symptoms (whether vaccinated or not vaccinated sila). we started to become too lenient and confident na basta bakunado ok na. it takes everyone to be considerate to not go out or not go to work physically if you are sick or has symptoms to prevent possible transmission of any type of viruses (whether if it's the regular flu or covid). yun ang gusto ko ipoint out dito.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/s3lvv3/my_proposal_is_penalized_individuals_na_lumabas/,14 01 2022

Allowing minors to go outside amidst Covid-19,"hi. gusto ko lang maglabas ng sama ng loob. nanggigigil ako. bakit open sila sa suggestion na payagan na ang mga bata na lumabas, especially pumasyal? where the h did that came from? wala na bang covid? ubo't sipon lang ba yung covid? kung ganito rin lang pala, bakit di na lang buksan ang mga schools para sa face-to-face classes? i'm sure mas masusunod ang protocols doon kesa sa mga malls, parks etc. masasayang yung ilang buwan na inilagi natin sa bahay. masasayang yung ilang buwan na pakikipaglaban ng mga health professionals. bakit kailangan pang pag-usapan? dapat automatic 'no' na yan. yung sa work, okay lang eh. pero yung para mamasyal? sobra naman! tapos cases will surge after holiday season, sino na namang kawawa? yung mga health professionals. bakit ba hindi sila pinapakinggan? hirap na hirap na sila. tapos puro sarap at luho lang ang iniisip ng iba. ang dahilan nila, naiinip na daw ang mga bata? sa dami ng pwedeng gawin ng mga bata sa bahay, maiinip sila? sana naman hindi puro sarili ang iniisip nila. wag din sanang idahilan ang pasko o dahil ang pasko ay para sa mga bata. we can always make the most out of christmas kahit nasa bahay lang. i'm sure mas gusto ng mga bata na kasama ang magulang nila, mga kapatid kesa gumala. at matalino ang mga bata ngayon, alam nila kung anong nangyayari sa paligid. now, pag sinabi natin na pwede ng lumabas, what would they think? okay na? wala ng covid? i'm so frustrated. what about you guys?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/k4x3kj/allowing_minors_to_go_outside_amidst_covid19/,1 12 2020

My two cents on the rising Covid cases here in PH and why we shouldn't be complacent.,"first of all, this not a fear mongering post. pretty sure actual cases never really significantly decreased these past months to last year. it's just that most cases weren't recorded for they're either asymptomatic or with just very mild symptoms not needing to get tested simply because of the vaccines working and the common variants are getting weaker. but we shouldn't ignore the recent increasing cases here in ph. there's a reason why the number of recorded cases is increasing again and it's because more people are getting tested. why are these people getting tested? coz their symptoms are more likely beyond just mild. kapag simpleng sipon naman hindi ka na magpapatest diba? again, i'm not trying to scare anyone. i'm not forcing anyone to mask up. i myself don't wear mask everytime anymore. let us not panic, but at the same time don't be complacent. (honestly not sure if tama gamit ko ng ""complacent"" hahaha pasok mga grammar nazi) keep an aye out. unless the government is faking the increasing recorded cases? well sana. all i can say now is... ""it's not over anywhere until it's over everywhere."" edit: coz iba iba tayo ng exp w/ covid. i lost my father because of covid. my eldest brother passed away early this year and i’m pretty sure it’s related to covid long term effects. i myself is suffering from heart palpitations months after catching the virus back in 2021. so you can’t blame me if i’m still keeping an eye out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/139w6qz/my_two_cents_on_the_rising_covid_cases_here_in_ph/,6 05 2023

Allowing minors to go outside amidst Covid-19,"hi. gusto ko lang maglabas ng sama ng loob. nanggigigil ako. bakit open sila sa suggestion na payagan na ang mga bata na lumabas, especially pumasyal? where the h did that came from? wala na bang covid? ubo't sipon lang ba yung covid? kung ganito rin lang pala, bakit di na lang buksan ang mga schools para sa face-to-face classes? i'm sure mas masusunod ang protocols doon kesa sa mga malls, parks etc. masasayang yung ilang buwan na inilagi natin sa bahay. masasayang yung ilang buwan na pakikipaglaban ng mga health professionals. bakit kailangan pang pag-usapan? dapat automatic 'no' na yan. yung sa work, okay lang eh. pero yung para mamasyal? sobra naman! tapos cases will surge after holiday season, sino na namang kawawa? yung mga health professionals. bakit ba hindi sila pinapakinggan? hirap na hirap na sila. tapos puro sarap at luho lang ang iniisip ng iba. ang dahilan nila, naiinip na daw ang mga bata? sa dami ng pwedeng gawin ng mga bata sa bahay, maiinip sila? sana naman hindi puro sarili ang iniisip nila. wag din sanang idahilan ang pasko o dahil ang pasko ay para sa mga bata. we can always make the most out of christmas kahit nasa bahay lang. i'm sure mas gusto ng mga bata na kasama ang magulang nila, mga kapatid kesa gumala. at matalino ang mga bata ngayon, alam nila kung anong nangyayari sa paligid. now, pag sinabi natin na pwede ng lumabas, what would they think? okay na? wala ng covid? i'm so frustrated. what about you guys?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/k4x3kj/allowing_minors_to_go_outside_amidst_covid19/,1 12 2020
My proposal is penalized individuals na lumabas na meron symptoms as a priority vs unvaccinated,"nanoticed ko na our government is now starting to punish individuals who are unvaccinated pero hindi ba ang unvaccinated ang dehado? they have the biggest risk right now if they go out, giving them more chances to get severe case of covid. pero tayong vaccinated, less chances of severe type of covid. not zero chance of covid. and everyone is still a potential carrier of the disease. pero i can see a lot of people working right now sa labas na may sipon at ubo. eto ung nakakaspread ng sakit pero no one is telling them sa bahay po muna kayo magquarantine kasi baka covid yan at nakakahawa. hindi ba mas dapat ipriority ito vs unvaccinated. or do a proper marketing sa pinas, if may sipon or ubo or trankaso, ok lang na di muna pumasok or wag ka na lumabas muna. ang sipon at ubo at pedeng makahawa ng iba, blah blah. alam ko turo ng mga magulang or prof natin dati, ubo sipon lang yan, kung sila nga mamatay na kayod parin para lang mabuhay or pumasok sa school etc. pero it's not the mentality na you are weak for not working or going to school but because you can be a carrier that can infect more people. edit: best explanation why we are encouraging vaccination to the unvax: https://www.reddit.com/r/philippines/comments/s3lvv3/my_proposal_is_penalized_individuals_na_lumabas/hslons9/ why providing sick leave is important and the current situation sa country natin why di mabigyan basta basta: https://www.reddit.com/r/philippines/comments/s3lvv3/my_proposal_is_penalized_individuals_na_lumabas/hsloul0/ also i want to clarify that i didn't post this to discourage people from getting vaccinated. get vaccinated if hindi ka pa vaccinated. this will prevent you from getting too sick or die from covid. magastos magkasakit. but the increase in numbers in covid right now isn't caused by the unvaccinated people but people who go out with symptoms (whether vaccinated or not vaccinated sila). we started to become too lenient and confident na basta bakunado ok na. it takes everyone to be considerate to not go out or not go to work physically if you are sick or has symptoms to prevent possible transmission of any type of viruses (whether if it's the regular flu or covid). yun ang gusto ko ipoint out dito.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/s3lvv3/my_proposal_is_penalized_individuals_na_lumabas/,14 01 2022

&#x200b; ang tinutukoy kong mga ""rules"" ay mga simpleng observations ko lamang sa kanya. mga bagay na hindi naman niya ipinagbabawal o dine-demand pero mas maganda kung alam mo. ito ang susi ng aming napakasaya at very smooth na relationship. hindi ba't may kasabihan tayo na, ""ang nagsasama nang matapat at sumusunod sa mga rules ng girlfriend niya, nagsasama nang maluwat."" &#x200b; heto ang mga simpleng rules kaya't perfect ang relationship namin ng aking perfect girlfriend. konti lang naman sila: &#x200b; rule #1. ayaw na ayaw ng girlfriend ko ang mga simbahan. hindi kasi siya religious at ang sabi niya, na-trauma raw siya dahil pinalaki siya ng kanyang lola na super relihiyosa. isa yatang panatiko ang lola niya na miyembro ng isang religious group sa probinsya nila na masasabing parang kulto na nga. kaya't kapag nakakakita siya ng mga churches (kahit anong religion), parang sumasama ang pakiramdam niya. isang beses nga, dumaan ako sa isang kalsada na hindi pamilyar sa akin. ang sabi kasi ng ka-opisina ko, shortcut daw iyon. kaya hindi ko alam na mayroon palang simbahang dadaanan. pagdaan na pagdaan ng kotse ko sa tapat ng simbahan, biglang nagtitili ang girlfriend ko. nagpupumiglas siya, parang nasasaktan ang buong katawan. grabeng trauma siguro ang sinapit niya sa kamay ng lola niya kaya ganoon ang reaksyon niya. kaya binilisan ko ang pagpapatakbo ng kotse ko hanggang sa makalayo kami roon. saka lamang siya huminahon. umiiyak siya, humihingi ng sorry. naiintindihan ko naman siya, wala siyang kasalanan. biktima lamang siya. hinaplos ko ang kanyang buhok at pinunasan ang kanyang mga luha. doon ko lang napansin na namumula ang kanyang noo at mga pisngi. pati mga braso niya ay namumula rin. nang pansinin ko ito, ang sabi niya ay baka nauntog siya o naihampas ang mga braso sa dashboard o sa bintana noong nagpupumiglas siya. niyaya ko siyang dalhin sa ospital pero tumanggi siya. sasabihin ko sanang imposibleng nauntog siya dahil hindi naman mukhang mga pasa ang nasa kanyang mukha at mga braso kundi mukha itong parang nasunog ngunit bigla siyang ngumiti, ang kanyang perpektong mga ngiti, kaya't nakumbisi na rin ako na okay na siya. pagkauwi namin, wala nang anumang bakas sa kanyang mukha na nauntog siya. &#x200b; kaya't kapag bumabiyahe kami, kailangang planuhin ang rutang dadaanan namin at siguraduhing hindi kami malalapit sa anumang simbahan. &#x200b; rule #2. hindi kumakain ng gulay ang girlfriend ko. siguro naman, marami sa inyo ganito ang mga girlfriend. mahilig sa meat pero ayaw kumain ng gulay. nakakatuwa, hindi ba? ako rin naman hindi masyadong mahilig sa gulay. kaya't kung kakain kami o lalabas, laging meat ang kinakain namin. hilig nga niya 'yung mga unli na barbecue. lalo na 'yung mayroong mga lamanloob. paboritong-paborito niya ang atay, intestines, puso, utak, at kung anu-ano pa. mahilig din siya sa dinuguan. minsan nga, isinama niya ako sa isang exclusive restaurant. mga members lang daw ang pwedeng kumain doon at miyembro siya at ang kanyang mga parents. nasa isang subdivision ito na puro mayayaman lamang ang nakatira. sa labas, mukha lang itong malaking mansyon pero pagpasok mo, isa pala itong restaurant. grabe, mayayaman talaga ang mga kumakain doon. may nakita pa nga akong mga artista at mga pulitiko. &#x200b; ang specialty ng restaurant na iyon ay mga lamanloob. tuwang-tuwa ang girlfriend ko nang orderin niya ang soup number 5. pinakain niya sa akin iyon at pinaubos dahil aphrodisiac daw iyon. masaya ko namang sinunod ito kahit na first time ko kumain noon. excited din ako dahil siguradong mapapalaban ako sa mangyayaring bakbakan pagkauwi namin. medyo natigilan lang ako noong una kong makita. ang alam ko kasi, ang main ingredient ng soup number 5 ay ari at bayag ng isang kalabaw. pero, noong pagsandok ko, parang iba ang nakita ko. parang iba ang hugis, parang malapit sa tao. pero siyempre, hindi ko na 'yun pinansin at siguradong imahinasyon ko lamang iyon. &#x200b; rule #3. hindi mahilig magpa-picture at mag-selfie ang aking girlfriend. ayaw na ayaw niya na kuhanan siya ng litrato, lalo na kung stolen. kaya nga kapag lumalabas kami, lagi siyang naka-cap at naka-long sleeves na jacket na may hoodie (ayaw niya rin kasi ang naaarawan). noong bago pa lamang kami, sinubukan ko siyang kuhanan ng picture nang palihim. pagtingin ko, nagtaka ako dahil parang deformed ang hitsura niya sa larawan. ni-restart ko ang phone ko at inulit pero ganoon pa rin. kaya tumabi ako sa kanya at mabilis na kumuha ng selfie. grabe ang galit niya sa akin! pinagsusuntok niya ako pero tinanggap ko ang lahat hanggang sa mawala ang galit niya. mga six months din bago ko nakita 'yung picture sa phone ko. inabot din kasi ng six months bago natanggal ang cast sa mga braso at binti ko. &#x200b; pagtingin ko sa picture na kinuha ko (kinuha ng girlfriend ko 'yung cellphone ko at itinago pero nakita ko rin naman sa closet niya noong makalabas ako sa ospital), naguluhan ako sa nakita ko. sa larawan, nakatingin ako sa camera at nakangiti. sa tabi ko, may isang matandang babae ang nakaupo. kulubot na ang kanyang mga mukha at kulay abo na ang mga buhok. suot-suot niya ang favorite t-shirt ng nobya ko. &#x200b; napailing na lang ako sa nakita ko. bilib na bilib pa naman ako sa camera ng iphone pero mukhang nagma-malfunction din pala ito. kaya ngayon, samsung na ang telepono ko. hindi ko na rin kinuhanan pa ng litrato ang girlfriend ko. &#x200b; rule #4. huwag magpapakita ng kabaitan sa ibang mga babae. ops! baka isipin niyo na selosa at mahigpit ang girlfriend ko. naku, diyan po kayo nagkakamali. sa katunayan, ayos lang sa kanya na makipagkaibigan ako sa mga babae. hindi siya nagagalit o nagtatampo. naalala ko nga noon, mayroon akong naging kaibigang babae sa trabaho, si carla. siyempre, tayong mga lalaki, natural na friendly tayo sa mga kababaihan. accomodating tayo at mahilig magbiro at mag-joke. madalas tuloy ay pinaghihinalaan tayo ng ating mga girlfriends. pero, iba ang girlfriend ko. ayos lang sa kanya ang ganoon. kahit nakikita niyang magkasama kami ni carla at nagtatawanan kapag bumibisita siya sa office, hindi siya nagagalit. nakakalungkot nga lang na hindi na natin kapiling si carla ngayon. natagpuan na lang siya isang umaga sa kuwarto niya, patay na. noong bumisita ako sa burol niya, nasabi sa akin ng kapatid niya na na-overdose daw sa gamot si carla. pagpasok daw nila sa kuwarto niya, nakita nila si carla na nakahiga sa kama, bumubula ang bibig. sa tabi niya, maraming nagkalat na gamot. puro tusok din ng karayom ang buong katawan niya. marahil daw, dahil sa depresyon o anumang mental illness, tinusok-tusok ni carla ang sarili niya ng karayom at pagkatapos ay uminom ng maraming gamot. ang nakapagtataka lamang daw, wala silang nakitang anumang karayom sa kuwarto ni carla. &#x200b; gaya nga ng sabi ko, hindi selosa ang girlfriend ko. marami akong mga naging kaibigang babae. nandyan si cherry na dating classmate ko noong college. marahil ay nakita mo siya sa balita. isang gabi kasi, habang papauwi galing trabaho, may tumulak daw sa kanya kaya nasagasaan siya ng isang bus. naging close ko rin si june at si barbie. kaso lang, maaga silang kinuha ni lord. bigla na lang silang na-comatose at hindi na nagising. over-fatigued daw sabi ng mga doktor. &#x200b; inaasar nga ako ng mga kaibigan ko ngayon na under daw ako ng girlfriend ko kaya hindi ako nakikipagkaibigan sa mga babae. pero ayos lang naman sa akin. mas masaya akong tawaging under kaysa naman magkaroon ng mga babaeng kaibigan pagkatapos... &#x200b; rule #5. kapag nagising ka sa madaling araw at nakita si girlfriend na naghahanap ng pagkain at mukhang gutom na gutom, magtago sa closet o kaya'y tumalon sa bintana. nakakatawa itong experience na ito. bakit ba ang mga babae, laging gutom? tapos, kapag pinakain mo masaya na kaagad sila? &#x200b; nagising ako isang beses mga alas-tres 'yata iyon. may narinig kasi akong mga kalampag kaya bumangon ako. wala rin kasi si girlfriend sa tabi ko. sa kusina ko siya nakita, hinahalughog ang ref namin. kaso, hindi pa kami nakakapag-grocery dahil wala pang sahod. &#x200b; tiningnan niya ako, nakakunot ang noo niya. ""gutom na ako,"" sabi niya. kahit gutom, sobrang ganda pa rin niya. kaya hindi ko napansin na tumutulo na pala ang laway niya. &#x200b; siyempre, ayokong nagugutom ang girlfriend ko kaya agad akong tumawag para magpa-deliver. pero, hindi na nakapagpigil pa ang girlfriend ko. sobrang gutom na siya, eh. kaya, ayun! &#x200b; pagkatapos niyang kumain, sobrang saya na niya. &#x200b; anyways, naging maayos naman ang lahat. ngayon, alam ko na ang gagawin kapag nakita siyang ganoon kaya wala naman na kaming naging problema pa. at saka, pwede namang mabuhay na isa lang ang kidney mo, hindi ba? basta't sisiguraduhin ko lang na hindi na ito mauulit pa. nag-iisa na lang ang natitira, eh. &#x200b; oh, napakadali lamang namang tandaan, 'di ba? 'yung ibang girlfriend diyan, napaka-demanding, ang dami-daming gusto, ang dami-daming ayaw. pero girlfriend ko, simple lang. simple pero perfect. kaya napakasaya ko sa kanya, eh. hindi ko na siya papakawalan. at siguradong-sigurado ako na hinding-hindi na niya ako papakawalan. &#x200b; edit: sa mga nagco-comment po at concerned sa akin, huwag po kayong mag-alala. ayos lang po ako. masaya, rewarding, at healthy ang relationship naming dalawa. oo, aaminin ko na medyo underweight ako ngayon nang kaunti (malnourished daw sabi ng doktor pero ano ba namang alam ng doktor? gusto lang akong pagka-perahan 'nun, eh!). medyo napapadalas din akong atakihin ng anemia (although hindi naman ako anemic dati, weird). pero, overall, perfect and happy kaming dalawa. &#x200b; tunay na love ko ang girlfriend ko!!! &#x200b; please subscribe to my pinoy horror animation channel!!! yt: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnaflx-rcdu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnaflx-rcdu)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/oiwuig/perpekto_ang_girlfriend_ko_basta_susundin_mo_lang/,12 07 2021
All of my loved ones are sick,"both parents are sick. relatives are sick. my girlfriend's also sick. wtf is happening? is this covid or it's just flu season? fortunately, ako lang walang sakit samin. siguro asymptomatic ako if positive nga kami. like i'm 100% fine even though i'm exposed to them kasi ayaw nila mag isolate, we even eat lunch and dinner together every day 🤡. nakakainis lang kasi, i told them to get tested pero they keep disregarding that they may have covid. like putangina we have the privilege to get tested for free (company benefits ni papa). habang yung ibang tao eh nag hihirap kasi they can't afford to be tested. they keep insisting that it's just flu plus the dust they inhaled from cleaning. if ever we're positive nga, this would be the second time. ganito rin sila nung una kaming nag ka covid, sipon lang daw. ayun, kung hindi ko pa pinilit mag pa test hindi sila maniniwala. kainis lang kasi walang sense of urgency.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/rznixz/all_of_my_loved_ones_are_sick/,9 01 2022
Pwede ba magpa-vaccine kahit may sinat?,"yung dad ko may runny nose at sipon since friday, at ngayon may sinat na (37.8). though may history naman talaga sya na sipunin, at lately kasi natutuyuan ng pawis dahil sa sobrang init at lagi hindj naka tshirt/sando. kung may sinat pa rin sya bukas (hopefully wala na), papayagan ba sya magpa-vaccine jab? bukas na kasi yung schedule nila ng 2nd dose ng astra.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/o468hv/pwede_ba_magpavaccine_kahit_may_sinat/,20 06 2021
I need advice regarding covid,"uncle ni wife died last saturday and most likely postive siya( waiting pa kami na e swab ). now before pa namatay si uncle my wife got a fever, konting ubo, sipon at irritation sa throat kaya nag self quarantine siya. from aug. 20 to 23. also never nawalan ng panlasa both si uncle and wife. ok na pakiramdam niya nang 24 kaya bumalik na siya sa amin (though di pa din siya lumalapit at tumatabi sa anak namin. if ever lumalapit siya nag mamask siya) &#x200b; question is: now that her uncle died and he is most probably positive should i put her back under quarantine? may direct contact kasi siya sa uncle ko and i am worried na baka talagang nahawa siya ng covid kaya siya nilagnat nung aug 20. both me and my wife are fully vaccinated but our son is not (5years old). currently wala kaming nararamdaman kahit anak namin.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/pdysbx/i_need_advice_regarding_covid/,29 08 2021
Mahal ko parin ang Pilipinas kahit masakit.,"naiinis ako sa lahat ng nangyayari pero sa halip ng mga yun, lahat ng bull, ng sakit ng ulo, mga hiya, ginusto ko parin mahalin ang bansa natin. di ko alam bakit parin gusto imahal ang bansa kahit na masakit. baka dahil sa mga bayani gaya ni jose rizal, andres bonifacio, antonio luna, apolinario mabini, lapulapu, manuel quezon at si ninoy aquino, iniisip ko sa sarili ko sayang naman kung titigil lang ako dahil sa lang sa sakit pero ang sakit bg mga bayani natin ay mas lala. so ang gusto ko lang sabihin ay hindi ako titigil lumaban para sa katotohanan at pag-unlad ng bansa. para sa inang bayan, ang bansang pilipinas. p.s. nagbobother sa isip ko at gusto iexpress ang nasa loob ko. salamat",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/xiafua/mahal_ko_parin_ang_pilipinas_kahit_masakit/,19 09 2022

Ang hirap ng buhay sa Pilipinas. (personal experience),"nang magkaroon ng pandemic, nawalan ng trabaho ang papa ko. dahil dito, nawalan kami ng perang pambili ng mga gamot niya na siyang dahilan para 4 months siyang hindi makainom. nagkaron siya ng infection sa loob ng katawan at kailangan siyang dalhin sa hospital pero hindi namin nagawa dahil wala kaming pera. may bukol naman ang mama ko sa kanyang dibdib pero hindi rin namin mapa-check dahil wala kaming pera. and for some reason, 'di namin magamit ang philhealth ng papa ko kahit sa buong buhay ng pagtatrabaho niya ay kinakaltasan sila. last week lang nakapagpacheck up ang papa ko at may bagong gamot na naidagdag sa maintenance niya. nagkaroon na ng trabaho ang papa ko pero 1,000 lang ang sweldo niya per week. nakakapagtinda kahit papaano ang mama ko. pero hindi ito sapat para sa aming gastusin dahil sobrang mahal ng mga bilihin. nahihirapan na ako sa online class dahil nasira ang laptop ko at 4,500 ang pagpapagawa. ang mahal rin ng internet/data. bsa student ako at kailangan naming gumamit ng excel. hindi ko na alam ang gagawin. salamat sa iyong pagbabasa. pasensya na kung mahaba. sadyang wala lang akong mapagsabihan at sobrang bigat na niya sa pakiramdam. nawa ay nasa maayos kang kalagayan at hangad ko ang iyong kasiyahan. salamat muli. edit: marami pong gusto humingi ng gcash ko po. edit: magandang araw po sa lahat. hindi ko po ine-expect na maraming gustong tutulong sa akin. ang tangi ko lamang pong hangad ay mailabas ang bigat ng nararamdaman ko po. ako po ay tiga-laguna at hindi po talaga kami makapunta sa ibang lugar dahil po sa pandemic. sa prostrate po ang sakit ng papa ko at hindi ko po alam ang sa mama ko. lcd po ang sira ng laptop ko po kaya hindi ko po maipagawa dahil mahal daw po ito. hindi ko po siya maibenta para makabili ng 2nd hand dahil ito po ay regalo sakin ng papa ko noon kay gusto ko rin po maipaayos. salamat po. i appreciate you all po. ps: ibagsak ang imperyalismo, pyudalismo at burukratang kapitalismo.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/lqaf95/ang_hirap_ng_buhay_sa_pilipinas_personal/,23 02 2021

Pamalo AnaIysís,"mama ko dati ay scientist, marami na syang na.experimentohang pamalo.. at ang kanyang guinea pig ay ako. may ibat ibang uri ng pamalo at ang damage effect nito ay nakadepende din sa disenyo at kung saan gawa. hanger. most of hangers are made of plastic kaya disposable sya, one time use only after nun sira na. sintoron nman, made of fake leather, pero tunog pa lang masakit na, usually pamalo ng mga boomer na tatay kasi lagi sila nka jeans. tsinelas, gawa sa goma, keri lang, yun nga lang babakat ang dumi sa balat kasi galing pa sa gala yung tsinelas. kaya after ng hazing malinis na ulit ung tsinelas, ikaw puno na ng dumi. tabo, made of plastic and has ergonomic handle. rare lang ang tabo, minsan lang nagagamit. most of the time, ang ganap is nasa cr pag ayaw maligo. minsan ginagawang kulungan ang cr, pag gusto mong makalaya dapat amoy sabon ka na. lubid, made of synthetic fibers, ung type na ginagamit for bdsm. never experienced this pero may kakilala akong guinea pig din na na.experience to. actually lima kaming guinea pig pero ako yung peyborit. may impact din ang lubid, bumabakat ang hulma sa balat. walis ting ting, made of coconut leaves. d naman masakit pero pag isang tingting lang mas masakit. pag brittle ung walis tingting may 15% chance na tutusok ung tingting sa balat, been there done that. walis tambo, mas masakit kaysa walis tingting at may 50% chance scratch kasi ung classic na version may alambre na nkatali sa dulo. chunky sandals, dense at makapal kaya pag na critical hit ka sa ulo for sure tumba ka plus may aftereffect na bukol. bato, yes na try ko na din na kasing laki ng kamao. range weapon sya, hindi pamalo, still i'll mention it here. pero sa lahat lahat ng na try ko, iba pa rin ung nginig ko sa makapal na panggatong, yung sinibak pa mula sa old belete tree trunk. yung mas malaki pa sa braso ni mama. tanda ko pa rin 3x un nangayari sa akin. malayo pa lang yung panggatong parang end of the world na. so mga 3x na apocalypse din yun. anyways. sa mga times na yun pilit kong ina.anaiyze kung ano ba talaga ang hyp0thesís ni mama, what is the conciusi0n? d ko lang alam if tapos na ni mama ung research nya kasi its been like 23 years na din. cant wait to read it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/15ddegi/pamalo_anaiysís/,30 07 2023

a day in the life of a 88m supporter,"may kausap ako kahapon 88m supporter tungkol sa kwento ng buhay. nagki kwento cia sakin ng mga nangyayare sa bansa ngayon. hindi ako sumasagot. nakikinig lang ako. naka open ang facebook niya. kwento kwento lang siya tungkol sa kung ano ang nasa balita at buhay ng mga pinoy ngayon. ramdam ko gusto niyang maging masaya ung kwentuhan namin, parang may sense of pride ba. parang may feeling of victory or happy moments kasi para sa kanya nanalo nga. nakatutok siya sa comment section at iba’t ibang facebook groups, daig pa niya nanonood ng boxing sa gigil at excitement. pero sa tingin ko, alam naman niya na hindi 88m ang binoto ko. nakikinig lang ako. okay naman daw. kesa kay leni na lugaw. nakikinig lang ako. hanggang sa maya maya lumabas na ang totoo. ung kwento ng taas ng pamasahe, piso laban sa dolyar, presyo sa palengke, ang gastos dumoble pero ang sahod wala ng kwenta. nung una, umiikot sa ulo ko ung galit kasi hindi sila nakinig. nung bumoto ako kayo pinaglaban ko, pero kalaban pala ang tingin niyo sakin. pero kalaunan, awa na ung nararamdaman ko pag naririnig ko sila. nalagay sila sa isang sitwasyon na wala ng atrasan kasi andyan na. at gusto man nilang tumiwalag, wala na silang magawa kasi lutong luto na ang utak nila na wala ng ibang dapat mamuno sa bansa kundi ang manok nila at anoman ang kahihinatnan ng bansa sa kanila ay ayos lang, tatanggapin, pag titiisan kasi may diyos naman daw. na npa ka kasi kumokontra ka. isa kang terorista na walang ibang plano kundi sirain ang bansa. dilawan ka. na ang parang goal ay patumbahin ang mga kokontra. siraan kung kinakailangan at kasuhan ang mga nagsasabi ng totoo na para sa kanila ay paninira. maniwala sa kung sino-sino, mali daw ang sinasabi ng mga libro. na okay lang mag tiis kasi ganun daw talaga ang buhay at huwag umasa sa gobyerno. at kung ano ano pa. nakikinig lang ako, bilang respeto. kahit papaano, nasa isip ko maswerte pa rin pala ako. natalo lang ang laban at pinaglaban ko sa naganap eleksyon pero hindi nawala sa tama ang pag iisip ko. pag nakikita ko silang pabalik balik sa pila, nag aantay ng libreng masasakyan habang ako kahit papaano kumportable habag ung nararamdaman ko. pero kahit ganoon, nakikita ko rin naman sa kanila na masaya sila sa ganun kwento ng buhay at yun ang realidad. masakit na realidad na kailangan makita ng lahat. na may mga tao na masaya na sa ayuda na okay na sila sa ganun klase ng buhay at malaking bagay yun para sa kanila. so ano ang plano ko? wala. natauhan rin ako kasi hindi ko pala dapat sila iniintindi. na hindi ko obligasyon na isipin sila lagi dahil lang sa nakikita ko na nagkakaganyan sila. nabukasan ang isip ko na sanay na sila sa ganyan buhay. normal na yan sa kanila. pero hindi ko rin naman nakikita ang sarili ko na sasaya kasi ganyan sila. tao pa rin naman ako. siguro, oo, may paminsan minsan na papasok sa isip ko na “deserve” pero pipigilan ko. siguro hanggang dun lang muna ako. nararamdaman ko rin kasi na habang bumaba ang kalidad ng pagiging isang tao ngayon. na hindi na yata ang uso ang nag iisip, nagbabasa at gumagamit ng utak naamoy ko na matagal tagal tayong mapagsasamantalahan. siguro, oo. naisahan nila tayo. pero pakiramdam ko pinagbibigyan lang sila ng mga tao, inuunawa, kung paano natin tinatanggap at pinag papasensyahan ung mga mahal natin sa buhay na alam naman natin na wala talagang maasahan. pero nag uumpisa pa lang ang laban. bawat taon may mga uusbong na bagong botante. at sila ung bagong pag asa para sa bagong hinaharap. mga kabataan, kayo na ang bahala sa amin. sa inyo kami naka asa. imulat niyo ang mga mata niyo sa tama at mali dahil kapag nakapag desisyon kayo ng tama, kayo ang mas makikinabang sa mga desisyon niyo. at para sa mga kagaya namin na nandito na, malas lang namin talaga dahil samin natyempo ung ganitong klase ng sitwasyon. sa susunod na pagkakataon ang sarap sigurong itanong, “masaya po ba kayo sa sitwasyon natin lahat ngayon?!”",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/xlhqol/a_day_in_the_life_of_a_88m_supporter/,23 09 2022

Truth why children struggles for reading comprehension in my POV,"i have worked part time as an assistant for my late mother when she was a teacher until she became a principal so i think i'm qualified to post this at least. so bakit nga nagiistruggle ung mga bata especially reading comprehension, what's happening within the school system and this is what i observed for 8 years i have worked in deped. 1. teachers are being worked for community services like feeding programs. imo dapat lgu services ang gumagawa nito not teachers. isa ito sa mga matrabahong ginagawa nila kaya nababawasan ang attention sa bata. pinakahassle dito ung liquidation which really drains the life out of you. 2. teachers are being worked for data reports instead of adding an employee for the task. isa ito sa mga pinakaiinisan ng mga teachers. not just time consuming, nakakalito pa sa dami ng data kailangang ipasa sa deped within a short period of time. the higher-ups mentality: kung ayaw mo humanap ka ng ibang trabaho (what a nice way to motivate teachers amiright?!). this job causes teachers para tamarin ng magturo, imbes na lesson plan ang inaatupag nasa data reports na, kaya paggawa ang grades ng bata dinaig pa na galing sa rekto para hindi na sakit sa ulo. also teachers have a hard time adjusting to technology especially yung mga nagstart pang nagturo since 90's era na nasanay na sa papel kaya madaming pinaparework na reports which again causes them to advert their attention from the students. 3. ito masakit: deped really doesnt give a fuck about children performances. totoo naman eh, they only care about the data they demand from the schools wether it is invented or not basta napirmahan at naaprubahan bahala na yung bata kung marunong o hindi. ang bottom line ng mga teachers kung bakit imbento na yung grading especially sa reading comprehension dahil sa reasons 1 & 2 (dagdag mo pa yung mga bata na ayaw matuto). also matrabaho ang magparemedial reading at apektado din grades mo as a teacher dahil mababa ung grado ng reading comprehension ng bata habang naghahabol ka ng data reports ng deped(o diba ang dami). so anong solusyon? ipasa mo nalang kahit hindi marunong. wala man lang akong nakitang employee na nagveverify ng reading comprehension ng mga students. basta ang kalakaran as long as papers goes it goes. 4. corruption in deped and broken promises. my mother (school principal) and her teachers are always promised laptops since 2017 pero walang dumadating. during their seminars laging pinagmamalaki ng regional supervisor for this annual budget at magkakaroon sila ng makabagong gamit. welp never happened, outdated parin laptops ng mga teachers, i think 2015 pa ata ung models na ginagamit ng mga teachers dito ofc im not going to disclose the location. this mostly started during duterte's term pero nung kay pnoy madami laging bagong learning materials at libro hindi pa masyado uso laptops noon. demanding ang deped pero hindi progressive yan ang katotohan sadly. out of touch ang higher-ups sa mga front liners kaya tayo umabot sa ganito. teachers works are overloaded and demanding yet underpaid. so kung may opinions pa kayo just comment down below.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/wsv9x2/truth_why_children_struggles_for_reading/,20 08 2022

My thanksgiving dinner experience with a BBM family.,"so eto nga guys, nag-punta kami (me (f), my wife (f) my sister and her bf) reluctantly sa invitation ng ilocano-bbm tita na kapit-bahay namin. may pinag-samahan naman yung family kahit papano, before elections super ganda ng communication namin sa kanila kasi kapitbahay namin dito sa canada. saktong usapan lang, nag-dasal kami bago kumain. to be honest, ang ganda nung prayer. as an agnostic, na-appreciate ko naman siya. pero gagi, yung kapatid ko brining-up yung pag-unfriend ko sa tito ko na misogynistic bbm supporter din tapos sabi sakin bigla nung bbm na tita: ""kayo kasi maka-leni kayong lahat diba? dapat di na kayo nagpapa-niwala sa kwento kwento lang. dapat sa totoong news sources lang."" mind you, binigyan ko lang siya nuon ng heads-up na fake yung website source niya (halatang fake kasi no actual sources from credible organizations, news sites, people, also the ones she sent me usually walang https:// (unsecure-doesnt mean all with https:// are legit as well) tapos yung design nung buong site, parang cult na may agila, illuminati sht - web designer and dev ako) tapos kinimkim pala niya yun. di ko nalang tinuloy yung pag-rebut ko kasi yung wife ko natatakot na magalit ako. i was very polite about it kasi mas matanda siya sakin and i was just looking out for her. then na-bring up nanaman ng kapatid ko about yung recently nangyari kay leila de lima. gagi nagulat ako sabi ng panganay niyang babae, ""dapat pinatay na nila yun. tinuluyan na dapat sinaksak."" sabay silang pamilyang tumawa (aside sa bunso na awkward sa situation) i felt chills. paanong nakakapag-dasal ng ganun kaganda tapos without any hesitations, would wish harm on other people just like that. ps. sinabihan din nung bbm tita yung mom ko directly bakit ako nag-cocomment and nag-popost na kumakalaban sa views niya. tas sabi ni bbm tita ""isang post mo nalang eh sasampalin na kita."" sabay tawa. eto din isang kinagalit ko sila yung traditional toxis filipino family. lakas nilang i-body shame yung asawa ko sa harap ko? muntik na talaga nag-liparan ang mga lumpia. anyways, officially cut ties with them na. may bbm supporter akong mga kakilala pero not that extreme (madalas dahil lang kasi ilocano. &nbsp; &nbsp; (edit) just to answer some questions. &nbsp; > quote q1. why was politics bough up nung dinner? i did not want to talk about politics because i knew it was going to be a mess, pero my sister thought our casual arguments sa fb nuon nung tita is civil and casual. she thought wrong. she had no idea the tita was extremely pro-marcos. she tried to change the topic but we decided na umalis bago magka-gulo (because i get really unpleasant pag nasimulan ko nang magalit and isa yun sa puna ng wife ko sakin kaya ayaw ko siya lalo ma-stress) anywho, lesson learned sa kapatid ko lol &nbsp; >quote q2. di bako sumagot or stoop up for what i believe in? i tried. di sa pag-tanggol sa pagkatalo or sa binoto ko, pero sa misinformation na nagbblur sa totoo at hindi. ang sagot sakin ""naniniwala ka kasi sa fake news. dun ka sa totoong balita lang. wag sa kwento kwento sa facebook at tiktok."" can't argue with people who always things they're right. siya nag-banggit na kay leni kami nag-vote last election and my side of the family all nodded (said ""yes. syempre tita."") then she proceeded to complain about the philippines being poor right now and then overcompensating sa pag-puri kay bbm after niya magreklamo. lol also i don't ever want to stoop low para makipag-sampalan at murahan sa harap nung bunso nila (na awkwardly listening to her mom talk about marcos. i guess she's the ""odd"" one in the family.) &nbsp; >quote q3. but they body-shamed your wife? di ka pumatol? as mentioned i can become harsh pag galit ako. my wife doesn't like me when i'm at that point of anger kaya we just looked at each other and signaled na umalis na. although i told them my wife is building strength kasi nag-ddeadlift siya. di nila alam ata kung ano yun. tbh nung tumahimik ako, napansin nung bf ng sister ko and akala daw nila may gagawin ako. i'm honestly surprised i held it in like that. i'm quite proud of myself. charot &nbsp; >quote q4. important ba sila sa inyo? nung bago-bago palang kami sa canada isa yung tita na nagshashare ng food niya samin sa work, nag-lolook out for us and genuinely concerned if we were okay. kaya masakit din na this happened. &nbsp; >quote q5. anong nangyari sa fresh lumpia? binigyan kami ng pa-take home pero wala na gusto kumain. binalik ko yung plate nila kahapon pero di ko na kinausap. iniwan ko nalang sa pinto nila. &nbsp; &nbsp; >quote edit: clarified that not all websites with ""https://"" are legit din.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/y1fwdi/my_thanksgiving_dinner_experience_with_a_bbm/,11 10 2022

Root Canal Inquiry,"under going kasi ako ng root canal. gusto ko lang magtanong regarding pricing ng root canal and the prices ng bawat proseso. sinabi kasi ng dentist ko na 5k per canal. tapos may sinabi pa ata about sa pricing ng filler which is 7k which is di ko kinuwestiyon initially kasi first timer ako. tapos finally, the crown ranging from 6.5k to 20k pesos. so ang quote sa akin is, since two canals sya: 5k x 2 (root canal itself), 7k x 2 (for filler??), and then the crown kung ang kukunin is yung pinakamahal (20k). in total, around 44k na sya. ngayon nagtanong-tanong ako sa ibang clinic: 3.k php per canal, 700php filler per canal, and crown ranging from 6k to 20k din. ang laki nung gap ng pricing nila especially sa filler na yan na mas mahal pa sa root canal mismo. kaya i opted na magtanong na rin sa community to make sense out of this. kung tama ba yung mga info na nakukuha ko. bale naumpisahan na sya, under cleaning and inu-obserbahan pa kung meron pang pain. pero pagdating sa filler procedure, binabalak kong magpull out then ipagawa sa iba na mas fair yung pricing. medyo masakit kasi the other day yung tooth, and gusto ko sya isalba/maibsan yung pain agad that time kaya pinaumpisahan ko na rin agad yung procedure. location ko pala is sa province around north luzon. salamat po sa magrereply.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/14p93h0/root_canal_inquiry/,3 07 2023

"Sorry, but I think the internet is indeed a factor why many people are ""depressed"" right now, BUT that's not necessarily a bad thing.","so i saw this short clip on facebook. galing siya sa isang film featuring tony labrusca. tony told her mom he's depressed, and the mom went ballistic, saying shits like depression is just a trend online. while i don't believe that depression is a trend, i do think the internet is also a reason why more and more middle-class people claim they're depression. sa palagay ko, ito ay parehong panget at mabuti -- pero mas matimbang ang mabuti kesa panget. let's talk about why is it a bad thing first. simple lang: some people might misinterpret this validation, and rather than dealing with their pains, they became addicted to it and became their sort of comfort. kumbaga, the internet validation became a new form of addiction -- gaya ng kung bakit may mga nalululong sa online games, pagkain, at droga. i've observed this a lot in the west. halimbawa nga, some of them gets offended with the word ""fat"" or ""obese"". dapat daw plus-size or the new sexy ang tawag para di masakit sa pandinig. see? rather than dealing with their insecurity, they resorted to demonizing an adjective, and that's a bad thing. nagiging eggshell na ang mga tao, all for the sake of not offending someone who has issues. now, let's talk about the good thing. syempre, unang-una dyan ang validation ulit. gaya rin ng pagkain, online games, and even drugs, wala naman talagang masama sa validation *as long as* you know your limit. most of you probably already know sugar is addicting, and is probably more addicting than marijuana, but hey, we don't hear people asking to ban sugar. even nutritionists themselves aren't saying that. ang lagi lang nilang sinasabi ay hinay-hinay lang. if you consumed it moderately, sobrang helpful iyon sa katawan mo especially if you're physically active. ganoon din sa validation. maraming middle class/rich kid na lumaki sa toxic positivity mindset. because of this, their frustrations were forced to repress simply because someone had it worse. pinagdaanan ko rin ito, sa totoo lang. my grandma loves to tell me na swerte ako dahil marino si papa at malaki ang sahod kaya hindi ko naranasan maghirap noon. anong naging epekto sakin? i was forced to conceal my angsts. dahil hindi ko mailabas, naipon lang nang naipon sa dibdib ko. parang naging time bomb siya, and it exploded in 2019, after my break-up with my long-term boyfriend. i felt so miserable. i'm still dealing with numbness and suicidal ideation until now. mabuti na lang, i have a good support group. gusto ko sanang mag-therapy pero ayoko kasi ng epekto ng gamot sakin, so i chose not to seek it. what could have happened if iba ang upbringing ko? i probably would have a better coping mechanism. right now, my coping mechanism is being workaholic, since it helps me distract myself from pain, pero hindi rin maganda ito. dami ko ngang pera pero di naman ako masaya sa buhay ko. that's why right now, i'm learning to balance my social life and work. heck, pati sex life and fitness, i'm slowly incorporating it to my lifestyle. isa pang bagay na maganda sa awareness ng mental health online ay yung mapuputol na natin ang siklo. let's admit it, one of the reasons why the gen xers and the generation earlier romanticized hard work and abuses so much is because ganoon sila pinaniwala. kaya nga karamihan sa mga toxic boss at customer ay mga galing sa henerasyon na ito. karamihan sa kanila ay mayroong anger management issue. naalala ko nga sa first job ko, i was bullied by my workmates, who are mostly 40+ and older. natutuwa kasi boss namin sakin dahil mabilis ako magtrabaho, and these people saw me as a threat, so they're bullying me through cold treatment. tapos lagi pa akong pinagchichismisan, at hindi rin ako sinasabihan kapag may announcement. it’s affecting my job a lot. so iyon, umalis ako after six months. nagalit si tita ko sakin, saying i should just shrug it off. imagine, rather than saying ang toxic ng ka-work ko, ako pa ang mali? but then, iyon kasi ang kinagisnan nilang buhay. through the mh awareness, the younger generation can break this cycle. we learn to be kinder and be less tolerant to bullshit like this, and i think that’s the best part. after all, bukod sa mali naman talaga ang bullying, counterproductive din ito, lalo na sa office. halimbawa na nga lang itong experience ko sa first work ko. natutuwa si boss sakin because i’m efficient. that efficiency decreased because of the bullying. remember, from an economic perspective, productivity loss will also result in income loss, which sadly many insecure coworkers didn’t know. hindi lang ako ang apektado kundi ang kumpanyang pinagtratrabahuhan nila. in the long run, sila rin ang maapektuhan sa ganitong kultura. and speaking of efficiency, mh awareness also improves it. think about it: hindi ka makakapagtrabaho nang matino kung burnt out ka, hindi ba? and this is not just anecdotal evidence. years ago, microsoft japan conducted a study to know what would happen if they implement a 4-day work system. japan is notorious for their overworking culture, so this is frowned upon. and surprisingly, mas malaki pa ang income nila during the time 4-day work happens. mas productive ang mga tao dahil hindi sila masyadong pagod. hindi rin uso yung pinapabagal ang trabaho para lang mapagkasya ng eight hours ang pwede sanang gawin within 3-4 hour. and nakatipid pa sila sa operating expenses dahil tatlong araw na walang gumagamit ng office. see? efficient, and it all started because microsoft is trying to improve the mental health state of their employees. the verdict? the internet does play a factor on why more people are self-diagnosing. but if you think about it, the benefits outweigh the liability. hindi lang natin natutulungan ang mga tao, but it would also improve the economy. it’s a win-win suggestion. recommendation?

"Dear women of this subreddit, sino sa inyo ang nagpa-myomectomy?","hi all! sino na sa inyo ang nakapag-experience ng myomectomy? i just found out that i have fibroids that are larger than usual and require surgery. although di naman siya masakit or anything, my doctor recommended na i have the surgery soon. kaso lang, two months na ang nakakalipas and hanggang ngayon hindi pa rin makapag-decide si doc kung kelan. paulit-ulit nalang ang tests and to be honest, nakakapagod ang pabalik balik sa ospital--at syempre, magastos--just because di makasiguro si doc kung ready na ba talaga ako for surgery (medyo komplikado daw yung position nung myoma). i am thinking of switching doctors na, and if you can recommend anyone, i would love to hear your thoughts. ayoko sa doctor na mukhang hindi sure sa sarili. also, pag lumipat ba ako ng doctor, ibig ba sabihin nung is uulitin ko yung mga tests? or pwede naman na ibigay ko nalang yung mga results ng previous tests ko? also, would you recommend changing doctors din? or should i just stick it out with my current ob? thank you sa mga sasagot.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/11e930u/dear_women_of_this_subreddit_sino_sa_inyo_ang/,28 02 2023
Ako lang ba ang biglang nakapag isip mag abroad after the nung resulta ng election?,"never ko naging pangarap ang mag trabaho abroad lalo na at okay naman ang trabaho ko since i'm earning more than what i needed. saka okay ang buhay ng pamilya ko. i have a close friend kasi na nag migrate na sa us few years ago and he keeps on convincing me na dun nalang din ako mag trabaho. sa totoo lang may standing job offer ako sa company nila. pero lagi ko lang dinidismissed yung idea at madalas ay tinatawanan ko lang siya. hindi ko talaga siya kinokonsider noon. but after election, we're talking about the result, with all the disappointment and emotion, he brings up the topic again. and for the first time, i actually listen to him. sobrang ganado pa niya mag kwento ng pros and cons. and starting to discuss the process. at sa totoo lang, muntik na niya akong mapa oo. buti napigilan ko. sabi ko pa sa kanya. ""lintek ka, naisahan mo ako dun ah. pero si 88m lang pala ang makakapag paalis sa akin sa bansa."" masakit dahil naalala ko yung sinabi ni vp about ofw, na sana hindi na sila umaalis out of necessity kundi dahil gusto lang nila. i'm neither of those, hindi ko kailangan at hindi ko din gusto, pero napapaisip ako dahil ayoko mag trabaho under marcos administration.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/upmvdp/ako_lang_ba_ang_biglang_nakapag_isip_mag_abroad/,14 05 2022
The 6th Stage: Defiance,"so, ayun na nga. ibang mundo na ang ating gigisingan. the dragon has fully reared its head. duterte coming into power in 2016 was but a tendril of smoke heralding the return of a marcos-with an all new cast of cronies! super. ngayon, sabay sabay natin matututunan ang totoong ibig sabihin ng pagtindig laban sa karimarimarim na dilim. tulad ng paglaban ng mga lolo’t lola, nanay, at tatay natin nung 1972. training wheels are off. totoo nga na papunta na tayo sa exciting part. nakakatakot. nakakapangilabot na yung dating mga binabasa mo lang, napapanuod mo lang sa dokyumentaryo, baka makita mo na sa mundong ginagalawan mo. nung una, i did not know how to cope, so lahat ng brand ng copium tinikman ko. hagulgol. galit. ang bobobo, ang tatanga! nangangako ng aalis na. alexa, show me afams in my area. but curiously, as the most turbulent of the emotions eased, something remained. tahimik lang siya habang inuubos ng kaluluwa ko ang kalungkutan. ngayon na humihina na, mas naririnig ko siya, unflinching and steadfast. i feel defiant, *in a way that i have never felt like in my life*. baka ang tadhana ni vp leni ay hindi ang manalo noong may 9, kundi sindihan ang totoong kilusan. marami satin, siguro parang namatayan ngayon. pero may nabuhay rin. it’s new, tentative. pero it is a force that cannot be denied. rivulets of water that will eventually cleave apart solid stone. yung grit ng mga tao na nanatili hanggang 6:30am para lang makaboto. this anger? this movement? it is ours. it is *us*. there is no taking it away. sabi nga ni vp leni, ang mulat, hindi na muli mapipikit. pretty words if heard a week ago. ngayon, habang hindi makatulog at makapigil sa pagluha ang marami satin, siguro mas naiintindihan natin ang bigat ng ibig niyang sabihin. it is painful because you know. i believe it is that pain and grief that will keep us moving. masakit maging mulat. masakit hindi bumitaw. madalas ko isipin kung paano ba ako magsusurvive sa rehimen na ganito. hindi ko alam ang lahat ng sagot, pero may apat ako na suggestion na pwede pagsimulan: first: alagaan ang sarili. mahaba pa ang gabi. kailangan maganda't gwapo tayo hanggang mag-umaga. eat well, exercise, hydrate, meditate, stay centered, cry if you need to, know when you need to step away. you will need all of yourself during the coming years. second: mag-ingat online. alam naman natin na kasama sa technique ang red-tagging and troll farms. ingatan ang sensitive and personal information. don’t give them anything to work with. third: digital budd(ies) system. kung ang social media ay tool na ginamit para ilubog tayo, that means we can also use it to work in our favor. gamitin para bumunot ng lakas sa isa’t isa. now is not the time to isolate yourself. if you’re not already doing so, follow inspirational folks like chel diokno and walden bello. kahit hindi lang para sa balita, kahit paalala lang na hindi ka nag-iisa. fourth: do not forget who is really at fault. may magandang video si atty luke espiritu sa page niya sa fb (bawal maglink, pero madaling mahanap) explaining why it is not the masses who are to blame. we gain *nothing* from alienating and attacking each other, while evil counts on us staying divided. yung mga nagsasabi na stop helping para mapressure yung gobyerno, i do not think that will work. this is a government that will not care. we will be punishing the wrong people, and their oppressors will twist the truth to turn us even harder against each other. kung vp leni supporter ka, tulad ng marami satin dito, you would be betraying the principles she stands for. kahit yung mga nakain ng fake news and misinformation, biktima lahat yan. hindi natin alam ilang taon unti-unting binabago ng propaganda ang perception nila ng katotohan. the machinery has been hard at work for years. palagay ko, ngayon palang natin totoong sisimulan ang pagrehabilitate. the real evil are the people who willfully and deliberately voted because they had power to gain. the real evil are the structures and elites who produced marcos jr. yakap. mahal kita at ipaglalaban kita, sa kung paano ko man kakayanin. stay safe, stay defiant, folks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/unpff9/the_6th_stage_defiance/,12 05 2022

[M]Y EXPERIENCE IN TUGUEGARAO CITY FLOODING. (Long post),"hello everyone! i'm from linao (east), tuguegarao city, yung sobrang lubog sa baha na barangay na trending sa buong social media. first and foremost, we[together with my fam & relatives] are safe from the flood(thanks god!). we are here at zone 2 of the barangay and yung totally flooded (lagpas bahay) is nasa zone 6 or 7, not quite sure. humuhupa na po ang baha at sana magtuloy-tuloy na. looking back at 11pm of nov. 13, 3 steps nalang po ng hagdan bago maabot ang 2nd floor ng bahay to think na elevated pa itong bahay so how much more na sa mga mabababang bahay, totally submerged na sila sa tubig baha. hindi makapasok ang mga rescuers dahil hindi kasya ang mga motorized rubber boats sa mga eskinita ng mga natrap na tao. idagdag mo ring zero visibility kasi napaka dilim dahil brownout sa buong lugar. iniisip na naming lumikas pero ang aking nanay at mga(3) tita ay kalmado lamang, nakahigang nasa likod ng ulo ang mga kamay at sabing ""sanay kami maligo sa dagat. huwag niyo kaming alalahanin, hindi kami aalis dito sa bahay"". sobrang nakakatakot sa labas kasi napakalakas ng agos ng baha, isang maling tapak at na-outbalance ka, siguradong buhay mo kaagad ang kapalit. we stayed in our house. i prayed nalang talaga na bumaba ang baha at pagsapit ng 2:37am ng nov.14, chineck ko yung pencil marks na ginawa ko ng 11pm sa dingding namin, bumaba pero almost 1 inch lang. (sobrang saya ko na dito kasi king ina at least bumaba na). tumuntong ako sa bubong ng sala namin na nasa bukana lang ng aming bintana, huminga ng malalim at napatulala sa mga bituin. sobrang dilim at tahimik ng paligid, ang tanging naririnig ko lamang ay mga tunog ng palaka. maya-maya, parang may mga naririnig akong mga boses ng tao at finocus ko ang pandinig sa mga iyon disregarding ang mga palaka, and wtf, ang naririnig ko na sinasabi ng mga tao ay ""rescue"" at ""tulong"" echoing all over our barangay in all directions. sobrang hina lamang ng naririnig ko dahil sa kalayuan ng mga taong sumisigaw. (kung napakinggan niyo yung 17sec clip ng mga tao sa social media na sumisigaw ng ""rescue"", yes that's all true. pero imagine hearing it personally from 3am to 4:30am, wala na talaga akong magagawa kundi ipagdasal na sana maabot na ng rescuers ang aking mga ka-barangay.) ako'y napraning at chineck ulit ang tubig ng 4:30am, bumaba pa ito ng 1 inch. i was so happy na sa span ng 5 hrs, bumaba ang tubig ng 2 inches. yes. 2. freaking. inches. my goodness! as of now, patuloy nang humuhupa ang baha. mababaw na ang tubig, hanggang dibdib na lamang sa labas ng bahay. i mean, may kalaliman parin pero kumpara nung peak ng baha, lagpas pa siguro kahit iangat ko ang aking kamay. approx 6-7ft (i'm 5'7 btw, alam ko to kasi bumili ako ng pagkain namin para dito sa bahay, hanggang leeg tas naka tip-toe ako sa tubig). note na sa zone 2 lamang po ito, sa ibang zones baka umabot ng 15-20ft. i'm writing this at 9pm of november 14, 2020(will probably post it late bc of signal issues), naghihintay ng mga ipamimigay na tubig-inumin dahil trapped parin po kami sa baha. gustuhin ko mang maging bridge of all donations for us here sa flooded area pero trapped parin po kami sa baha at kami rin po mismo ay nangangailangan ng tulong. i excluded all political aspects, didn't dig deep sa mga issues like ""nasaan si mayor"" issue, ""okay lang ang cagayan"" issue by governor, and kilala niyo na kung sinong tinutukoy kong gustong lumangoy. vp leni, u da real mvp being the 1st one to respond to our calls from the national politicians. (alam kong may kanya kanya tayong manok pero sana hindi tayo magbulag-bulagan) #2022 sobrang nakakatakot ang rumaragasang tubig ng baha, sana lagi po tayong mag-iingat. nakalimutan na po ng mga tao ang social distancing dahil hand in hand po kaming nakikipag-sapalaran at nakikipag-laban para sa buhay laban sa bahang ito. ito ang aking mga karanasan sa baha, pasensya kung may mali man kayong makita at mabasa. please pray for us. kapit lang. babangon ulit tayo. maraming salamat sa lahat ng tumulong, tumutulong at tutulong pa lalo na sa mga rescuers natin. this is the worst flood i've ever had. please be safe! #cagayanvalleyneedshelp #bangoncagayanvalley",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ju3w8l/my_experience_in_tuguegarao_city_flooding_long/,14 11 2020

Ano technique ninyo para tulungan ang parents ninyo na sumunod sa COVID guidelines?,"see title. yung magulang ko ay in their late 60s na. yung father ko, kahit anong pagmamakaawa gawin ko, pilit pa din lumalabas for non-essentials, tapos ayaw magsuot ng mask. hindi naman niya need lumabas kasi sapat naman passive income for daily needs, kaso pag pinakisuyuan mo na shelter in place, kung ano anong idinadahilan. hindi ko alam kung dahil ba ayaw niyang mawala ang ""independence"" niya, bored sa bahay, o sadyang hindi lang sineseryoso yung threat ng covid. pag kinakausap namin at nire-request na magsuot ng mask pag lumabas, kaartehan lang daw yung mask tapos tinatamad daw magsuot. ang masakit, nung sinabi namin na ""paano kung mahawa ka?"", ang sagot ba naman eh, ""kung mahawa, edi mahawa, bahala na."" i love my parents deeply and ayaw na ayaw ko na may mangyari sa kanila. ano ginawa ninyo para matulungan ang mga matitigas ang ulo na kamag-anak na seryosohin yung mga safety precautions sa covid?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/jqd8ha/ano_technique_ninyo_para_tulungan_ang_parents/,8 11 2020

having a gobyernong tapat....,"been reading posts. we're expecting blengblong supporters to realize the lack of change (or decline) in quality of governance. i think the challenge here is that we really havent been able to win with a gobyernong tapat narrative vs the ""golden age ideal"" they had. i assume none of us have even actually had a ph gobyernong tapat ever - hence it takes imagination. so. ang masakit is. theres nothing weve experienced in recent history to compare it against. no standard set that this upcoming ""leadership"" will fail against. basically nothing a few ayudas, roads and bridges could mask. wala eh. itll be historical revisionism. a set of new cronies here and there making a buck. these convicted politicians clearing their names as they go into retirement. anyway quick thoughts ko lang.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/uogyjk/having_a_gobyernong_tapat/,13 05 2022

"alex, tanghaling tapat ng sabado, 2021","(any review for this is very-very much appreciated. i'm an aspiring writer po and i just launched a passion project anthology, isa po ito sa mga kwento) &#x200b; **chairman** ngayon ko lang naranasan ‘to sa tagal ko nang nanunungkulan sa barangay. isama mo na sa mga karanasang ‘yon ang lahat ng away mag-asawa, suntukan ng mga lasing, at mga batang ginagahasa sa bukiran. pero eto… ngayon ko lang napansin na buong araw ko na palang hinihimas ang rosaryong nakasabit sa leeg ko. maya’t-maya ko pa hinahalikan at binubulungan na sana’y wag mangyari sa pamilya ko ang nakita ko kanina. naririnig ko pa rin ang sigaw ni cecil, kumare’t-kapitbahay namin, tanghaling tapat ng sabado, kung saan ang tanghalian sa buong kalsada nami’y naantala dahil sa kanyang nakakakilabot na sigaw. sa ilalim ng nagbabagang init ay nagsitakbuhan kami upang sumaklolo. kinailangan ko pang iwanan ang tinola ni misis at ang isang basong softdrinks na nilalanguyan pa dalawang yelo nang ako’y tumakbo papunta sa bahay ni cecil. ngayo’y hindi pa rin ako kumakain. sa totoo nga’y hindi pa ako nakakaranas ng gutom. hindi ko pa ata kaya. sa bahay ni cecil ay dinatnan namin ang katawan ng panganay ni cecil na si joe na nakaratay sa braso ng kanyang bunsong kapatid na si alex, sa sahig ng kanilang sala. sa leeg ni joe ay nakabaon ang basag na bote na ginamit ni alex na balot na balot sa dugo ng kanyang kapatid. agad ang kapit at halik ko sa aking rosaryo nang makita ko ang imahe; na parang sinaunang obra na naglalahad ng malagim na kwento. pero ano ang kwento neto? hanggang ngayon ay wala pa rin kaming ideya kung bakit. magmula sa pagsigaw ni cecil ng, “anong nangyari?! anak, anong nangyari?!” sa tulalang alex na nakatitig sa dilat na mga mata ni joe, hanggang sa pagpunta namin dito sa aking opisina sa barangay, ay wala pa rin kaming makuhang rason mula sa bakit. sa isang maliit na kwarto sa aking opisina’y pinaupo ko muna si alex. tulala at sinusubukang burahin ang dugo sa kanyang mukha gamit ang duguan ring damit n’ya. hinainan ko ng isang bote ng softdrinks at tatlong pandesal mula pa sa agahan namin kanina si alex, na agad namang n’yang kinain ng walang pag-aalinlangan. dito na nagsimulang gumapang ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod. isang kilabot na hindi ko maipaliwanag, habang pinapanood ko si alex na walang awat sa pagkain, habang ako’y hindi ko pa rin magawang matakam sa masarap na lutong nag-aabang sa’kin sa bahay. “alex,” marahan kong sinabi. “ba’t mo ginawa ‘yun?” tumingin lamang sa’kin si alex, patay na mga mata, bibig na mabagal ang nguya. at sa kanyang paglunok ay walang mga salitang bumalik sa’kin. hindi ko alam kung bakit pero bigla kong naalala si jefferson, isang tricycle driver dito sa’min. dalawang taon na ang nakakalipas nang mapatay n’ya ang isang dayo na nakaaway n’ya sa kalsada. nangyari ‘to nang kamuntikan n’yang makasalpukan ang sasakyan ng dayo, at nang nahinto silang dalawa’y nagkasagutan muna sila bago mapikon si jefferson. hinampas n’ya ng bakal na tubo ang dayo. hindi na raw n’ya napigilan dahil sa mga mapanglait na mga salitang tinawag sa kanya. bobo, unggoy, uling, mababa. labing-isang beses paulit-ulit na hinampas ni jefferson sa ulo ang dayo, at sa sobrang lakas ng bawat hampas ay may parte na ng utak na lumabas dito. sa prisinto’y naalala ko si jefferson, iyak nang iyak at humihingi ng tawad dahil sa nangyari. hindi makakain, hindi rin makatulog. nilamon na s’ya ng konsensya n’ya, at ang konsensya n’ya ang tumulak sa kanya na agawin ang baril ng isa sa mga pulis na nagbabantay, at iputok sa kanyang sariling ulo. nasaktan si jefferson, nagalit, at di nakapagpigil. naintindihan ko ang kwento ‘nun. pero bakit hindi ko maintindihan ‘to? alam kong magkasundo ang magkapatid na ‘to. alam ko kung ga’no sila kalapit sa isa’t-isa. kaya pa’no nangyari ‘to? ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod ay gumagapang paakyat hanggang sa aking dibdib, tila ba kumakapit ng mahigpit. pasikip nang pasikip at medyo nahihirapan akong huminga. ang kakaibang pakiramdam na ‘to’y tumitindi habang nanatiling tahimik at nakatitig lamang sa’kin si alex. biglang iniabot ni alex ang kanyang kamay at dito tumalon na ang puso ko. napaatras ako sa aking kinauupuan, at mabilisan kong hinugot ang aking rosaryo mula sa pagkakatago nito sa aking damit. itinutok ko ito kay alex, na walang ibang kibo kun’di ang kunin ang bote ng softdrinks na nasa harapan n’ya. mas bumilis pa ang pagkatok sa aking dibdib, na para bang kamuntikan na kong mamatay. habang si alex nama’y pinapanood lang ako habang patuloy ang kanyang pag-inom. wala nga ata talagang mangyayari, at nang maramdaman ko kung gaano katahimik ang kwarto’y kumalma na ako. bakit sa dulo ng utak ko’y hinihiling ko na may sapi o di kaya’y isang demonyo talaga ang kaharap ko, at sa presensya ng aking rosaryo’y masasaktan s’ya. kahit anong kakaiba. kahit ano basta magkaroon lang ng eksplenasyon ang nangyari. pero siguro’y kakaiba na rin ang ikinikilos ng bata. at siguro nga’y mas dapat talaga akong matakot sa buhay kaysa sa patay. **cecil** “saan ba ko nagkulang?” tanong ni aling cecil sa mga kumare n’yang nakapalibot sa kanya sa masikip na opisina ni chairmain. napapaligiran din s’ya ng makukulay na mga pamaypay na hindi sabay-sabay ang pagaspas sa harap n’ya; nilulunod si aling cecil sa hangin. ang kanyang mukha nama’y tila ba isang rebulto ng santo kung punas-punasan ng mga panyo. “hindi ko pa rin maintindihan,” dugtong n’ya. “hindi naman ako nagkulang sa aruga. pareho ko namang pinapakita sa kanila na pantay ang pagmamahal ko sa kanila.” tuyo na ang mga mata ni aling cecil, ngunit tila ba hindi pa rin tapos ang kanyang pag-iyak. “hindi sila nag-aaway. hindi ko man lang narinig na nagtalo silang dalawa. o kung may pagtatalo man, malamang sa malamang maliit na bagay lang ‘yun. hindi yung ikakamatay mo!” isang labi ng lumapit sa tenga ni aling cecil, “alam mo tingin ko, baka inggit ‘yan. kasi si joe lang may trabaho sa kanilang dalawa, di ba? tapos si alex, wala pa rin sa kolehiyo. nag-aaral pa rin. sigurado akong ‘yun ang dahilan.” isa pang labi ang lumapit sa kabilang tenga naman ni aling cecil, “baka napikon na. kasi di ba halos s’ya na sa lahat ng gawaing bahay? baka pakiramdam n’ya porke’t mas malaki ambag ng kapatid n’ya , alila na s’ya neto.” isang labi naman na kaharap ni aling cecil ang nagsabing, “baka nagbabait-baitan lang kasi nga si joe ang halos sumasalo sa mga bayarin, pati sa pag-aaral n’ya. pero galit talaga s’ya, kasi baka naman may pagkakataong mas nabibigyang-atensyon si joe kahit hindi n’yo napapansin. kasi halimbawa uuwi s’yang pagod galing sa trabaho, syempre di n’yo maiwasang alagaan, pagsilbihan.” sa gitna ng mga labing ito’y si aling cecil, at ang ideyang unti-unting nabubuo dahil sa mga sinasabi ng mga labi sa kanya. “siguro,” sabi n’ya. “siguro nga.” **abbie** ang pangalan n’ya’y abbie. social worker daw s’ya. pagpasok n’ya’y agad bumungad sa’kin ang asul na bra sa ilalim ng dilaw na blouse nang tapatan ito ng liwanag mula sa bintanang katabi ko. sa kanyang pagtali ng buhok ay nakita kong basang-basa na ang kanyang kili-kili at kumikinang na sa pawis ang kanyang leeg. “alex?” sabi n’ya habang maya’t-mayang tinutulak ng kanyang daliri ang salamin n’yang dumudulas sa kanyang matangos na ilong. “bakit di mo ikwento muna sa’kin ang nangyari bago tayo umalis dito?” pasensya ka na, abbie. hindi ko nagawang sabihin kay chairman, na kilala pa mandin namin. hinding-hindi ko rin masasabi sa’yo. walang ibang maglalahad ng nangyari kun’di ang mga taong nais magbigay kahulugan dito, kasi kung ako tatanungin kung bakit, sa totoo lang, hindi ko rin alam ang isasagot. may nabasag akong bote sa kusina kanina, at sa pagpulot ko nito’y pumasok sa isip ko ang isang udyok. yung tipo ng udyok kapag nasa mataas kang lugar, at bigla mo na lang gustong itulak ang kasama mo. pero alam mong hindi ito dapat gawin, at kakapit ka pa nang mas mahigpit sa kanila para masiguro mong hindi ito mangyayari. ang udyok na ito’y nagsabi sa’kin na isaksak ko kay kuya ang basag na bote. at nalaman ko na lang na totoo na pala ang lahat nang dumapo sa aking balat ang mainit na dugo ni kuya. nahinto lang ako nang maramdaman ko ang buto sa leeg n’ya at nang marinig kong nabibilaukan na s’ya sa kanyang sariling dugo. hindi ko pa rin alam kung bakit. sana, tulad ng iniisip ni chairman, ay nasapian na nga lang ako. pero nakita ko ang lahat, andun ako. hindi ko lang alam na totoo pala ang lahat. namatay si kuya joe sa wala. at hindi ko matanggap na wala. normal lang sana ang sabado namin. tahimik. nanonood lang si kuya ng tv, naglilinis ako sa kusina. si nanay nama’y namamalengke ng pananghalian namin. bicol express daw ang lulutuin n’ya. puta, sinira ko ang araw. gusto kong umiyak dahil hindi na kami babalik sa salo-salo namin. “alex?” muling tawag ni abbie. “gusto kong malaman kung bakit. tayong dalawa lang. kaibigan mo ko dito. hinding-hindi ko ‘to sasabihin sa nanay mo, sa mga kapitbahay n’yo. may mga naririnig ako sa labas na dahil daw sa inggit? totoo ba ‘to? sa inggit nga? magmula nang dinala ako ni chairman dito sa maliit na kwartong ito’y napagpasyahan kong manahimik na lang sa nangyari. sa ngayo’y nilalabanan ko ang mga luha, nilalabanan ko ang panginginig ng aking bibig, at ang mga salitang gustong lumabas mula sa’kin. dapat mukhang hindi ko pinagsisisihan. dapat mukha akong galit. para naman mabigyang halaga, mabigyan ng ibig-sabihin ang pagkamatay ni kuya joe. dapat tinatatak ko sa utak ko na dapat lang! dapat lang sa kanya ang nangyari. dapat hindi ako bibigay. dahil kapag natalo ako, mamatay talaga sa wala si kuya. “sige, kung ayaw mong magkwento, ako muna. kasi naalala ko ‘tong isang batang babae at ang tatay n’yang abusado. tatay n’yang lasinggero. tatay n’yang isang beses s’yang hinipuan sa kanyang sariling kwarto at pinilit. ampon ang batang ‘yon, at tatay-tatayan n’ya lang etong umaabuso sa kanya. takot na takot ang bata dahil pakiramdam n’ya isang gabi’y papatayin na lang s’ya bigla neto. kaya naman isang gabi, nang bigla s’yang pinuntahan ng kanyang tatay upang pagsamantalahan ulit, sinasaksak ito ng bata gamit ang lapis sa mata, sa leeg, at sa dibdib.” kumuha ng panyo si abbie. sa kanyang paggalaw ay muling sumisilip ang kanyang bra sa likod ng blouse na parang mga batang naglalaro sa likod ng kurtina. “masarap sa pakiramdam, pero pumapatay pa rin s’ya ng tao. ilan taon n’yang dinibdib ‘yun. hanggang ngayon nararamdaman pa rin n’ya ang mga kamay ng tatay n’ya sa kanyang ari. sa kanyang dibdib. ilang taon bago n’ya matanggap ang ginawa n’ya. ngayon, medyo mahirap pa ring ikwento, pero kahit papaano’y kaya ko na. nangyari na kasi.” para bang may sumuntok sa aking dibdib nang marinig ko ‘to. bigla kong tinanggal ang aking paningin sa kanyang bra, at sa paggalaw ng aking mga mata’y bigla kong naramdaman ang pamumuo ng mga luha. “ayos lang, alex. pero andito lang ako. aalagaan ka muna namin. tapos pag handa ka na, makikinig ako. kahit pakonte-konte pa, ayos lang. aantayin kong mabuo ang kwento mo.” bumibilis bigla ang tibok ng puso ko. lalong nanginginig ang aking labi. at biglang pumasok si kuya sa isip ko, tumatakbo papalayo sa akin. mga bata pa kami, at hinahabol ko s’ya. “alex?” kuya wag kang lumayo! “alex?” kuya dito ka lang! kailangan kita dito! “sige, ayusin na natin pag-alis mo.” at parang isang batang nadapa sa semento, dito na walang awat na tumulo ang luha sa aking mga mata. “alex?” “hindi ko rin alam… hindi… ko rin alam. sorry, kuya! sorry! hindi ko rin alam kung bakit! patayin n’yo na lang ako! hindi ko alam anong nangyari! hindi ko na kaya!” lumalabo na ang aking paningin, pero kahit ga’no kalabo ang aking mga mata’y kitang-kita ko ang gulat at takot sa mukha ni abbie. pasensya ka na, kuya.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/nlygsa/alex_tanghaling_tapat_ng_sabado_2021/,27 05 2021

(marami ang hindi nakaboto dahil ayaw pumirma ng waiver & natatakot na baka ma-tamper yung ballots nila kapag iniwan lang sa presinto) may 11, 2022 12:45am. nakatapos na mag-batch feed at papunta pa lang ng comelec ang mga staff para makapagsauli ng election paraphernalia. may 12, 2022 sinabi ng comelec na hindi sila makakapag-provide ng ot pay para sa mga staff na inabot ng 2 days sa presinto dahil hindi naman daw sila empleyado ng comelec. ang idinadahilan pa nila, alam naman daw ng mga teachers na possible mag-extend ng oras pag election, at ""konting sakripisyo"" lang naman daw yun para sa bayan. nakakagalit lang dahil teachers ang sobrang nahihirapan sa election, sila ang sumasalo ng frustrations ng mga botante. pero kung tutuusin, lahat ng problema sa election ay dahil sa incompetence ni comelec. napag-uusapan na namin sa school ngayon kung pwede mahikayat lahat ng school staff (teachers & admin) na wag mag-serve para sa next election (barangay election on dec. 2022).",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/upkx4v/hindi_na_ulit_ako_magseserve_next_election/,14 05 2022

Philippines - Reproductive & Contraceptive Methods Discussion,"ang hirap pala talaga mag avail nang contraceptives dito sa pinas no? i have been planning for a long time now already to consider using contraceptive methods since my bf and i have been living together for almost a year now. nung una pa lang, i already noticed na knowledge and guidance for the common people about this is very limited. there are no proper ways na accessible to learn the abcs of this. it's so hard for people like me who grew up without a family doctor to try and avail any healthcare extravaganzas. mangagapa ka talaga sa dilim. and now that i'm 23 yrs old na, it did not get easier. i tried to visit some websites, hopeful that i could find something or someone to help me with this case but to no avail. i ended up relying on random people's comments nalang and hearsay about it so i decided to give it a try. i first went to our local barangay health center to inquire about it. turns out, they would not entertain a childless individual na mag aavail ng contraceptives. i understand naman if priority nila yung mga patients na madami talagang anak. but instead of educating me about it, they instead replied using a degrading tone kung bakit ako mag aavail kung wala pa naman daw akong anak. di naman daw kailangan mag control pag wala pang anak. they even went as far as to be surprised when i said that my period lasts 7 days (which alarmed me since they work at a health center, they should know that women's period normally lasts between 2 to 7 days, right?) . when i got up to go, i even heard them mocking and laughing at me. days passed, i decided to try sa public local hospital since i have heard may services available sila dun. i must've been cursed kase it's the same thing. even worse because i got shamed and humiliated in front of other patients as the personnel who catered me got mad kung bakit ako nag aavail na dalaga pa naman daw ako. i tried to ask calmly then kung asan nya ko pwede ma refer na pwede mag cater sa mga childless individual seeking for contraceptives pero sinagot lang ako nang padabog na ""ewan ko basta hindi dito. family planning to eh tas wala kang pamilya. ba't mag co control ka pa wala ka naman palang anak?!"". i would understand if they would refuse me any services if that's their policy, masakit lang kase i am trying to do the right thing pero pinapahiya pa sa ibang tao. i am trying to find my way din naman kase wala talaga akong alam sa ganyan. nakaka disappoint lang.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/15by9f0/philippines_reproductive_contraceptive_methods/,28 07 2023

Sino ang mas kawawa? Magulang o Anak?,"i agree: 1. both biktima ng sistema ng lipunan o ng kultura ng kahirapan 2. both pwedeng magkamali sa desisyon sa buhay 3. both biktima ng pagpapasa ng kultura 4. both merong utak at puso na pwedeng magkamali. i cannot put it into words dahil sobrang personal sa akin neto pero tanong ko lang sa magulang dito o magbabalak mag anak sino ba ang mas kawawa ang magulang or anak? kapag nag desisyon na bumuhay ng bata ang isang couple, automatically magulang na sila, whether they are capable or not, they decided to have a child. pero sa lipunan nating ito, laging talo ang anak. wala namang kamuwang muwang ang bata at higit sa lahat hindi namilit na buhayin sa mundong ito, magulang ang nag desisyon na mag anak pero bakit sila pa din ang kawawa? kawawa sila palagi lalo na sa media portrayal kaya lahat tayo na condition na ganon, laging superior ang magulang sa lahat ng bagay, lagi silang kawawa, lagi silang dapat intindihin, lagi sila dapat bigyan ng pagmamahal, hindi ko maintindihan. nakaka awa lang na hanggang ngayon hindi pa rin mabago yan, example na lang sa mini miss u, may mga bata na naaawa sa magulang nila dahil napapagod magtrabaho, gusto na nilang magtrabaho para makatulong sa magulang nila, hindi ba nakaka gago yun na ipinapakita nila sa anak nila na napapagod sila dahil sa anak nila??? na iniisip ng bata na pabigat sila sa magulang nila??? eh hindi naman ang bata ang nag desisyon na mabuhay siya sa mundong ito kundi ang magulang niya? oo na sige na, sistema na may problema pero maaayos ba agad yan? wala bang mga utak o puso ang mga magulang na ito para maisip nila na desisyon nila mag anak pero pinaparamdam o pinapakita nila sa anak nila na mahirap mabuhay dahil sa anak nila? ang anak laging masama ang edit kapag ka humiwalay, nag decide magpamilya , inuna ang sarili, laging susumbatan ng magulang na pinakain, pinalaki sila neto , pinag aral — eh aba dapat lang kasi responsibilidad mo yun bilang magulang? bakit ganyan yung ibang magulang parang nag anak lang para pagkakitaan o para may mag alaga sa kanila sa pag tanda. hindi ba may buhay din yang mga anak? bakit laging kawawa ang mga magulang??? in the first place naman sila nag decide na bumuhay ng bata, kung nahihirapan sila consequence na yun ng desisyon nila? para sa akin, tama na yang paawa edit, kasalanan mo yan kasi nag anak ka?? hindi ko magets yung edit sa media, na parang utang na loob pa ng bata na nabuhay siya, na parang pinilit niya yung magulang na ipanganak siya?? nag anak lang ba ang mga magulang kasi wala silang pangarap sa buhay? nag anak lang ba sila para may mag alaga sa kanila? nag anak lang ba sila dahil sa pressure ng lipunan? pero isa pa rin yang desisyon? at kung ano mang consequence niyan e own up to it?? hindi yung papaawa ka sa ibang tao, sa tv shows, sa radio shows at maski sa harap ng anak mo para magkaroon ng utang na loob sayo at maawa sayo? hindi ko siya maput into words dahil nga personal kong na experience to e , yung pag mamanipula ng magulang, yung pagpaparamdam sa akin na kasalanan ko kung bakit nahihirapan sila, kasalanan ko kung bakit wala kaming makaen, pisikal at verbal abuse ang naranasan ko masakit man o hindi abuso yun para sa akin , at naranasan ko lahat ito mula bata hanggang sa paglaki, nakwento ko na din to sa mga close friends ko pero para sa kanila normal lang daw yun kaya naisantabi ko yung feelings ko. normal na pala na matawag na palamunin kahit bata ka palang. kaya nung nagkatrabaho ako, sobrang saya ko na makatulong pero nung may nabasa ako somewhere dun ako nagising sa katotohanan na, hindi ko dapat naranasan yun kasi bata lang ako that time. umiiyak ako habang tinatype to, si oa pala to eh haha. tumigil sa pagtatrabaho yung tatay ko nung nagkatrabaho na ako, edi malamang ako na naging breadwinner malamang sa malamang di lang ako nakakaranas neto, kaya nung nagising ako dun na bumalik lahat ng alaala ko nung bata ako, na akala ko normal lang yun pala hindi. hindi dapat. tumutulong ako kasi walang choice, kung hindi ako tutulong walang tutulong sa kanila kasi hindi na bila kaya tulungan sarili nila. o diba kawawa na naman sila. pero kelan magiging kawawa ang mga anak na nagsantabi ng pangarap sa buhay, ng oras, ng pamumuhay magisa, ng pagkakaroon ng karanasan katulad ng mga taong may matitinong magulang, kelannn??? hindi lang ako nakaranas neto dahil sigurado ako marami ding naging forced na maging breadwinner sila pero lagi pa ding kawawa edit ang mga magulang sa media portrayal, maski sa lipunan natin, kelan magkakaroon ng narrative na ""ayan anak pa more, alam mong hindi mo kaya nag anak ka pa, ngayon papa awa kang nahihirapan"" like.... hindi pa ba abuso na bubuo ka ng anak knowing na hindi mo kaya?... sa lipunang ito, sa ekonomiyang ito? nakakasawa na at lubos na nakakalungkot makarinig sa mga bata sa tv na kaya sila sumasali sa contest para makatulong sa magulang. hindi ba nahiya tong mga magulang na pinapakita nila sa mga bata yung paghihirap nila? fcking fake it. maawa ka sa bata, ipinaparamdam mo na mahirap ang buhay dahil sa kanya, at kelangan ka bigyan ng award dahil sa paghihirap mo, eh kung pwede namang hindi ka mahirapan kung hindi ka nag decide mag anak. gets ko na may problema sa sistema, pero maaayos banagad yan? hindi talaga pwede sisihin yung magulang sa desisyon nila? nakakainis yung ibang pa woke sa twitter na sasabihin na problema sa sistema yan kaya ganyan ang mga magulang? like so okay lang mang abuso kasi kasalanan ng sistema, hindi talaga sila pwede sisihin sa katangahang desisyon na ginawa nila???? ewan ko, mapa media, mapa woke. laging kawawa ang magulang , laging kelangan may bigger understanding ang mga anak sa magulang ""hindi mo maiintindihan kasi hindi ka pa nagiging magulang"" like bitch may utak ako and i'm in the right mind not to have a child knowing na im not financially capable para buhayin sila i can only speak for myself, for what i experienced, kung ano nakikita ko sa tv at kung ano response ng kaibigan ko sa karanasan ko, and by all of that, it only means na normal lang to pero hindi talaga dapat siya normal. tl;dr media portrayal affects the thinking of filipinos na nakaka awa ang magulang and it is love to be abusive towards children na forced sila to be a breadwinner and maging caregiver sa magulang dahil sa reponsibilities ng magulang masked as sacrifices. this normalizes the abusive culture at dynamics ng magulang at ng anak. hindi nakaka awa ang mga magulang, desisyon nilang mag anak kaya kung mahirapan man sila dapat di sila mag pa awa. mas nakaka awa ang mga anak na hindi naman nila desisyong mabuhay pero mag susuffer sila sa lipunang ito dahil sa desisyon ng magulang nila. knowing this, sino ang mas nakaka awa?

Sabi sa akin ng Ante ko ay hindi ako tunay na Engineer dahil walang board exam yung couse ko.,"(***aita for arguing with my boomer aunt over the fact that she claimed i wasn't a true engineer and devalued my nearly three years of work experience in the logistics and supply chain industry by indicating it wasn't profitable****)*. &#x200b; minsan na rin ba kayong binansagang '**bastos**' ng mga nakakatanda na sarado ang isipan sa mga bagay-bagay dahil nagbibigay ka ng mga punto patungkol sa mga karanasan na **mas** alam mo dahil hindi nila naranasan? ako kasi, oo. si ante (**auntie**) ay kilala naming relihiyoso, palasimba at masasabi mo na kapag gumuho ang mundo ay talagang malabo na mapunta sa impyerno dahil halos tatlong beses sa isang araw kung magrosaryo. isa siyang dh sa hong kong at isa namang assistant sa isang simbahang katoliko kada rest day niya. mataas ang respeto ko kay ante dahil sa hirap ng buhay ay nagawa nila ni tatay (nakababatang kapatid ni ante) noon na makapunta sa abroad para magtrabaho. marami na ring naipundar at nakapagpagawa ng bahay. ako naman ay isang simpleng tao lang, nagtapos ako ng kursong **industrial engineer** sa isang kilalang unibersidad sa luzon. bata pa lang kasi ako noon, sobrang naeengganyo ako magbyahe-byahe at maghahatid ng pagkain ng tatay at kuya ko kapag sila ay nasa bukid - masasabi ko na isa ito sa konsepto kung bakit ko pinili manatili at magtrabaho sa industriya ng logistics at supply chain. at noong nagtapos ako sa kolehiyo, ang una kong trabaho ay qc (quality control) engineer sa isang manufacturing company sa valenzuela. ngunit sa sobrang boring ng trabaho ay napilitan ako magresign at pinilit maghanap ng logistics o supply chain company at sa awa ng diyos ay nakahanap naman. dito, masasabi kong masakit sa ulo kasi madami kang kakausaping tao, dapat marunong ka magmando ng operations, magbigay ng tamang update kada oras at magbigay ng assurance sa mga business partners para mapanatili ang maayos na samahan. **maliit ang sahod?** oo. **masaya ba ako?** sobra. nagumpisa ang pangyayari sa pagtawag ko sa ante ko dahil gusto ko siya kumustahin. labis-labis ang pagkamiss ko sa kanya dahil mula ng 2020 ay hindi na siya nakauwi pa ng pilipinas dulot ng covid-19. bandang alas-siyete ng gabi noong october 30 ay napatawag ako. pagkasagot ng tawag, iniisip ko na bubungad sa akin yung linya niya lagi na ""hello, how are you?"" pero hindi, sermon kaagad. mga limang minuto ng paguusap namin ay patungkol sa pinsan ko na nakapag-abroad na at nagtapos bilang nurse at sa isang kakilala namin na masasabi kong marami ng work experience bilang mechanical engineer at 'board passer'. pagkwento niya ay hindi ko maiwasan na hindi maging komportable lalo na't palaging binabanggit na walang board exam ang ie o di kaya maliit lang daw ang sahod ng mga ie. ang tawag pa nga niya sa akin minsan ay **rider** o **delivery boy** kasi ang madalas kong sabihin ay nagtatrabaho ako sa industriya ng logistics at supply chain - at dahil hindi niya alam ang sinasabi ko, ginamit ko ang katagang '*nagpapadedeliver ng mga produkto sa mga mall, tindahan o warehouse*' para madali niya maintindihan yung konspeto ng trabaho ko. nabanggit pa nga na walang pera sa trabaho ko kahit pa pausbong pa lang ako sa sa professional career (almost 3 years work experience) ko at hindi ko nagustuhan ang mga sinabi - na hindi ako tunay na engineer dahil wala akong board exam. pinupunto ko sa kanya na kahit wala kang board exam ay pwede ka pa ring maging engineer. dito pa lang ay nagtataasan na kami ng boses. pinipilit pa rin na pumunta lang daw ako sa ie na course dahil takot ako sa board exam. nabanggit pa niya na hindi siya gaanong proud kasi hindi kilala yung course at hindi ganon katunog. binigyan ko ulit ng isa pang punto na sobrang importante ng mge ie sa mga kumpanya dahil kami ang nagaayos ng mga proseso. makaraang sinabi ko ito, binansagang na akong 'bastos', 'palasumbat' ni ante sabay binabaan ng tawag. sa tawag din ay kinukumpara niya ako dun sa kakilala namin na marami ng nabiling lupa, sasakyan. take note, almost 25 years na nagtatrabaho iyon compare sa akin na magtatatlong taon pa lang. ang iniisip ko ngayon, ako nga ba talaga itong bastos o palasumbat dahil pinili ko magreason-out regarding sa course ko at maging sa trabaho ko?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/yjcckq/sabi_sa_akin_ng_ante_ko_ay_hindi_ako_tunay_na/,1 11 2022

""ron will be happy, mailene. gusto niya makitang masaya kayo ng anak mo."" sumikip ang dibdib ko sa kanyang sinabi. pinisil niya ang aking pisngi at inabot sakin ang cage upang mabuhat si ruine. alex is ron's bestfriend. siya ang naging father figure ni ruine. siya ang kasama ko noong nanganak ako, siya ang kasama ko ng unang beses magsalita ang anak ko ng ""mama"", siya ang kasama ko noong sinugod ko sa hospital si ruine ng lagnatin ito. si alex ang nagbantay sa amin ni ruine. kahit kailan ay hindi siya umalis sa tabi ko. itinaas ko ang cage na aking hawak at kinausap ang rabbit sa loob nito. ""katulad mo ako, nakakulong ka sa cage at nakakulong ako sa nakaraan."" napakagat labi ako ng marinig ko ang hagikgik ni ruine, napatingin ako sa likuran ni alex at buhat buhat niya ang aking anak. kitang kita ang saya ni ruine sa kanyang tito alex. humalik ito sa pisngi ng kanyang tito at ngumiti muli. sumunod na ako sa sasakyan ni alex, pinaupo niya ako sa passenger seat at inayos niya ang uupuan ni ruine sa likod katabi ang rabbit nito. sumakay na si alex at pinaandar ang sasakyan. nagulat ako ng kunin niya ang aking kamay kaya binawi ko ito sa kanya.

Recalibrating the Pink campaign.,"it is exhausting and emotionally draining, i know. okay let me dump all my thoughts here for all of the pinks who wish to turn the tide. * **intensify content creation.** we are doing decently on facebook and just need to keep on going. s**hare caravan moments, debate highlights, anecdotes, pink tiktoks, etc.** on tiktok we are doing fine but still not enough, so i am pleading to the pink tiktokers to vigorously combat the algorithm. on youtube, we are losing. compare the amount of pink content to the myriad of fringe conspiracies and fake news propagated with it's clickbait (and oftentimes tacky) thumbnails and titles on the site, it is tough. dahil mas matrabaho ang gumawa ng 3+ min yt content kaysa mga 1 min (average) tiktoks. * **continue the show of force.** if you can go to a caravan near you, **go** (with safety in mind). always challenge the bandwagon. we are a race of sore losers kaya mahilig tayong tumaya sa mananalo at matindi magreact pag hindi. beauty contests, basketball, boxing, you name some event that involves a ton of pride. **stay unbothered and be yourself in these caravans.** utilize the fomo feeling to break the bandwagon by having fun while being a civic participant. * **take surveys as it is, snapshots.** not implying causation here, but survey releases often coincides with the ""victories"" of the pink camp. never dismiss the survey without checking its credibility and time frame and learning what we can from the results. this is a psych war, given how many of us are emotionally invested with making our candidate emerge as the winner. kaya when these results come to rain on our parade, **bend but never break**. * **begin engaging on the ground with common unities.** the elections are very polarizing and we lose the listener kapag nauna agad yung personality. **be a calm, collected, respectful, listener when we engage with non-supporters**. ask them ano ba ang hinahanap nila sa lider, ano yung mga issue na gusto mong pagtuunan ng kandidato, and then proceed kung may plano ba yung napipisil niya. use the clearbook method if you will. we know napakahirap magconvert ng bbm to leni, but possible siya with persistence. however, if you can sense the misogyny, use that to our advantage (it's wrong i know, but again its a psych war din) by shifting them away from bbm to isko. * **when online, know your battles.** unlike sa ground, mas capable tayo of behaving badly due to the anonymity. **stay on the line of reason and truth.** trolls can be either extremely rabid (threats) or extremely passive (i was a leni eme but now i am bbm). ilugar ang approach sa mga ito but **never shame them (kahit repleksyon ng moralidad ang kanilang choice)**. very misplaced ang anger nila, thus the boogeyman dilawan and the red-tagging tendency. never use academic credentials to immediately dismiss the other. masakit masabihan ka ng mali dahil ugali natin ay may tendency maging mapagmataas. feel free to add more here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/t3cph8/recalibrating_the_pink_campaign/,28 02 2022

Deeply hurt and disappointed,"long rant ahead. sorry, just had to get this off my chest. i've never been invested in politics until this election season. isa ako sa mga walang pake dati. this was until nagannounce si vp na tatakbo siya. di ko alam bakit pero ilang beses ako naiyak while watching her speech. mas naiyak pa ko lalo nung nakita ko yung overwhelming support that poured online that day. nagulat ako kasi i'm aware of how much she's been vilified for the past years. so it was a pleasant surprise to see suddenly almost everyone i know expressing support. tapos nagtuloy tuloy na. dumami ng dumami yung mga tumitindig. padami ng padami yung mga sumasali sa rallies. yung mga kilala kong apolitical din started to make a stand. sobrang saya ko nun kasi akala ko finally, natauhan na tayo lahat. ayaw na natin sa nakasanayan natin na hirap, gusto na natin ng tunay na pagbabago. i trust the science of the surveys pero naniniwala ako na may milagro pa na pwede mangyari to make vp win. after all, ngayon lang natin nakita ung ganitong level of engagement from the common filipino. kumilos ang mga tao on a scale na hindi pa natin nakita before. nagsipag din naman ang team nila vp. ginawa nila lahat ng pwede. so for me, napakaunfair ng mundo naman if at the end of it all, all the hard work, passion and dedication, those efforts won't be rewarded, especially if it's for the good of everyone. pero sadly, that's not how the world works. ang sakit. nakakatakot. nakakabahala. it's very selfish to say but i feel i've been betrayed by my fellow countrymen. ako at lahat ng tumindig para sa bansa at para din naman sa kanila. basta masakit hahaha anyway, as vp (but to me, the president) said during her mda speech, ""ang minsan nang namulat, hinding-hindi na ulit mapipikit "", this election has changed me forever. and for that, i'm very grateful. i'm sure i'm not the only one. sana lahat tayo handa pa rin ipaglaban ang mga dapat ipaglaban sa mga susunod na taon.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ulsk0e/deeply_hurt_and_disappointed/,9 05 2022
A Love Letter to BBM Supporters- something we can try?,"base sa survey data, the only way for vp leni to win is to get voters from bbm. konti na lang ang undecided at konti rin lang ang macoconvert from the rest of the candidates. can't emphasize this enough but we really need bbm supporters, even the hardcore ones, on our side. so can we make our campaign directed towards bbm supporters? not by showcasing vp leni's gazillion accomplishments, they're not gonna want to see that, but a campaign that feels like a love letter to them? of course, it can be only successful if we actually manage to understand them. otherwise, magiging cringe yan like other politicians' attempts to seem like they understand their voters. dapat genuine talaga. pag may konting bahid ng condescension, ekis agad yan. pag may parang sinasabing mali ang napupusuan nila or nabiktima lang sila ng fake news o ng corrupt sistema, ekis din agad yan. masakit na masabihan na mali ka kahit sa anong paraan sinabi. pwedeng may message din galing mismo kay vp leni for them. something that a parent would lovingly say to their children. at dahil genuine naman talaga si vp leni, i think she can pull this off. the goal is not to make them realize that they were wrong but only to make them feel understood. duterte managed to do that in 2016 with the millions of filipinos underserved by the aquino administration na hindi naman maramdaman yung taon-taong gdp growth. kahit yun lang. maramdaman lang nila na totoong naiintindihan sila ni vp leni. walang cliche na mga statements, good example is how duterte managed to appear genuine kasi iba siya magsalita sa mga nakasanayan ng pulitiko that time. that'd be a good start already for them to go seek vp leni of their own accord, as opposed to tinambakan lang ng facts at mga resibo. they should take the first step themselves towards vp leni themselves. ayaw natin ng pinapangunahan tayo. hope we can also refrain from making posts/comments mocking bbm kasi yung mga supporters ang nasasaktan, not bbm. instead of seeing that they're wrong they feel insulted kasi we have insulted their choice/decision-making process so nagiging defensive sila. hindi naman lahat ng kakampinks ang gumagawa niyan, yung iba lang, kasali na ako dun. nalinawan lang ako after having a long pero medyo maayos na facebook comments sagutan with a bbm supporter. hindi ko rin alam kung paano gagawin yan, pero buti na lang, maraming creative at magagaling na mga kakampinks. we really need bbm supporters on our side. buti na lang din at halos lahat naman siguro ng bbm supporters, gusto lang din maging maayos ang pilipinas, iba nga lang ang nakitaan nila ng solusyon. meaning, may pag-asang mag-shift sila to vp leni. patunay diyan ang maraming-maraming mga ex-dds or ex-bbm supporters na lumipat na kay vp leni. may pag-asa pa talaga pero kailangan natin itong pagtrabahuhan. remember, the truth is on our side and leni robredo is the real deal. mas mahirap ang ginagawa ng kalaban trying to bend reality and selling a defective product pero they have a highly paid, focused team working on it. pero together, united, we can do things they can never do kahit gaano pa karaming pera ang itapal nila which we proved with our big and getting even bigger rallies. pero kulang yun, kasi may counterattack na ang kalaban by spreading even more lies about the rallies. we need to do more if we want to win. kaya magtipon, mag-usap, at kumilos na tayo.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/tkd4sq/a_love_letter_to_bbm_supporters_something_we_can/,22 03 2022

Excluded,"ang hirap din pala na lumaki sa pamilya na hinahayaan ka lang. nung elementary ako nag aaral lang talaga or ginugusto ko lang masama sa honor dahil gusto ng nanay ko yun. sinasabi lang ng nanay ko na okay lang daw kahit hindi pero yung totoo sobrang sumasama loob nya pag bumababa grades ko. samin kasing mag kakapatid ako lang yung honor student simula elementary. naaalala ko sumasali akong mga extra curricular kasi gusto ng nanay ko yun. basta gusto nya yung ginagawa ko di ko kailangan mag sabi. naalala ko nun gusto kong sumali sa music club kasi nag aaral silang tumugtog ng mga instruments di lang pag kanta. wala naman akong talent sa pag kanta kaya instruments lang gusto ko, bata palang ako gusto kong tumugtog. sabi ko pa nun pag nag 1st ako piano yung gift nila. sabi nila oo. college nako yung piano ko wala padin hahahaha. hinahayaan nila kong gawin yung mga gusto nilang ipagawa sakin pero yung gusto ko di ko magawa. everytime na may competition ako pag uwi ko galing school hindi nila ko pinagagawa ng gawaing bahay dun lang ako sa kwarto mag review lang daw ako. lagi yun, di nila alam pag nasa kwarto ako umiiyak lang ako madalas kasi sa school buong araw nag rereview lang ako pag uwi ganon ulit. sa isip isip ko di nyo bako iask if kamusta ko, okay ba ko. kamusta yung pag rereview ko. pinaka masakit pa tuwing may competition ako sasabihin ko lang yung araw kailan then bibigyan lang nila kong allowance yun na yun. wala bang ibang support akong makukuha. di nila ko sinasamahan yung mga kasama ko may parents, ako sagot ko lang may work po. laging teacher kasama ko tapos uuwi ako di nila ko tatanungin anong nangyari sa laban. no one knows if i win or not. then nagugulat sila pag nag congrats mga teacher ko sa kanila dahil nanalo ko sa competion. high school nag aral akong tumugtog ng guitar pero pinigilan din nila. paulit ulit lang pag top ako sa class wala akong maririnig sa kanila pag bumaba yung grades nagagalit sila. di nila nalalaman anong nangyayari sakin. gusto kong mag aral ng instrument at mag paint di ko magawa kasi di nila ko isusupport dun. wala akong masabihan nahihirapan na ko mag aral. wala akong masabihan na nagkaka anxiety and panic attack ako. wala silang alam sakin at hindi nila gustong alamin yun. hinahayaan lang nila ko na parang hangin. ang hirap pala, naiingit sakin mga kapatid ko kasi daw nagagawa ko daw yung gusto ko ha ha ha. samantalang sila need padaw nila mag paalam at magsabi kay nanay. sila nga tong may emotional support lagi. lagi silang kinakausap ni nanay para alamin anong nararamdaman nila. last year mag isa kong nakatira sa bahay namin. i celebrate my birthday on my own. no one checks me. i got sick, walang naka alam. buti pa yung mga tita, tito and pinsan ko sinisilip ako sa bahay at kinakamusta kasi takot na baka mapano ako wala akong kasama. pero mga kapatid nung nasa ibang bansa kasama yung tita ko at nag work sa ibang lugar every day kinakamusta. tapos pag may sakit sila tinatawagan ako ng parents ko para alagaan sila pero ako, ako pa yung bumibili ng gamot ko kahit nilalagnat na ko. tatawag yung parents ko sakin para kamustahin mga kapatid ko. pangalawa ako sa pinaka bata samin pero need ko alagaan yung 4 kong kapatid. never sa bahay ko na natanong nila ko kung kamusta ko. kahit iyun lang hindi ko natanggap. sa mata ng ibang tao ang perfect kong anak. may anak kang achiever at masunurin pero di nila alam na ginagawa ko lang yung kasi wala akong worth sa pamilya namin. parang throphy pinagmamalaki sa ibang tao pero hindi naman pinapansin pag di pinansin ng iba. yung tingin nila sakin independent kasi kayang ko gawin yung mga bagay ng walang tulong ng iba pero di nila alam feeling ko kasi left out ako and excluded ako sa family kaya ginagawa ko yun. wala akong kakampi, walang sumusuporta skain ako lang. sinong aasahan ko ako lang hindi. ang hirap.. napapa isip ko kasalan ko ba kaya rin ako nagkaganto?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/11yhgvx/excluded/,22 03 2023
The opposition should elect celebrities. Seriously.,"#1) robin premise i've seen people criticize the choice of robin padilla, which is understandable. and no way am i a simp for this guy (i hate machismo culture), but his [platforms](https://votepilipinas.com/candidate/padilla-robin.html) in the given site are actually more comprehensive than 88m's lmao. a lot of them are broad statements, but it's going to be *very effective*. why? because he's a celebrity. one thing this election has taught us is **filipinos love celebrities**, likely even more than actual policies. they recognize a name and they *will* vote for them and their whole family. robin padilla gained a lot of votes even from leni supporters based from the transparency votes. let not the echo chambers convince you that people didn't vote for him because they thought he would be a legit good candidate. mabait, gwapo, may dating, astig, ~~seeeeegggsss~~... all of these aspects are *appealing* and most of all, **charismatic**. you know who capitalized on that very well? duterte. no way is robin going to be another duterte, but he's another icon of the masses, and you would be coping at this point if you disagree. #2) influence of celebrities take the previously mentioned platforms of robin padilla. ^(seriously, look at it. you're a redditor, you can read articles out of boredom.) celebrities can reach the masses and make them understand the core aspects of most issues. best of all, they appeal to emotion and attention, keeping their audiences interested and glued to their words. there's also a nuance here that will beat a nefarious system that the corrupt political dynasties clearly want to proliferate: dictatorship. to be more broad, a king. a leader who will only throw orders that the loyalists will follow without question. wait, why celebrities? because celebrities encourage people to act and feel the filipino spirit in whatever field they act in. ignore all political affiliations for now... willie revillame with the presentation of sob stories in his game shows, encouraging filipinos to have more compassion towards others. manny pacquiao na kayang umahon sa kahirapan at pagsikapang mag-aral na may puso sa bayan. miss universe for international recognitions, na may poise and grace in words. even for the mu seasons alone, you would see people engrossed in their screens, and maybe try to impersonate the candidates. character. beauty. impressions. at least, these would all be values that would not encourage filipinos to stay still in their homes. **they would want to be their idols**, even in the smallest of ways. much better than taking a role model out of a political family's son's and daughters. to clarify, hindi sila yung specifically sinusuggest ko. just an idea on what celebrity culture instills on the filipino people. although manny is certainly an option at this point... #3) fake news, education, viability credentials? we've seen the majority of filipinos do **not** care about those. charisma? now, that's the good shit. now, you can say that 88m doesn't have charisma - and i'll be the first one to agree with full contempt - but he has a family name. it carries him through the alamanos and moments where he actively evades supporters themselves. most of all, he has a system of disinformation propping him up. what can good ol' tv show celebrities do in this case? just speak honestly. fake news? filipinos voted for robin because he's handsome. filipinos can forget martial law atrocities because they can recognize a name (this is a case distinct from martial law *deniers* by the way, primarily because the bad education in the country allows it). what can be thrown at celebrities? fake news. what would filipinos say? ""mabait naman yan nung nasa tv show niya."" ""nakakatawa kaya siya. kesa yung mga elitista hindi naman kilala ang pinoy."" *even 88m who cannot even accurately tell the fare of daily commute* was branded as someone who represent the masses. laughable, i know, but it's the horrible reality we live in now. celebrities already start at great footing, and the opposition can do well to capitalize on a culture that **treats elections like a betting game.** for the last time, credentials? let celebrities step up, and have them hire lawyers in the background. a lot of celebrities have already been vocal about important issues, regardless of affiliations, and the filipino people will listen to them over politicians they deem ""elitists"". #4) others ang radikal na pagmamahal ay walang dating sa masa. masakit. lalo na't tayo pa ngayon ang iniikutan ng mga scripts na tayo pa ang nasama, gayong tayo ang nag-effort na maging mabubuti at **mapagpasensyang** mga mamamayan. pero the moment na tayo ang pumatol sa mga kabastusan nila, tayo pa ang naging problema. mga duwag ang mga loyalista. pero *may malaking bahagi ng masa ang walang pakialam sa drama natin online*. naaabutan pa rin sila ng mga celebrities. ganyan kultura sa pilipinas. it's about time the opposition facilitates change through that. stop proposing idealistic solutions like ""better governance"". **filipinos don't want candidates with good morals, they want someone with a good image.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/unovdt/the_opposition_should_elect_celebrities_seriously/,12 05 2022

Midnight Memories.,"alas dose 'y media nang hating-gabi na iyon at papasok na ako sa trabaho. *sa fx* isang magandang babae ang sumakay at naupo sa tabi ko. mabango at kahit medyo madilim sa loob ng fx ay litaw ang ganda n'ya. maya-maya pa ay medyo napa-sandal na s'ya sa balikat ko. - babae: ""ayy.. sorry."" *hinawi ang buhok pataas at nahikab*. ako: *ngumiti at tumango bilang pag-tanggap sa sorry nito*. ilang minuto pa ang nag-daan ay naramdaman kong napapa-sandal na naman s'ya sa balikat ko. napa-tingin ako sa balikat ko at tiniti-tigan ko o ina-abangan kung matu-tuluyan bang mahihiga s'ya sa balikat ko. hindi ko alam kung anong tuwa ang nararamdaman ko noong mga panahon na iyon, pero ang alam ko, masaya ako sa mga nangyayari. maya-maya pa nga ay tuluyan nang nahiga sa balikat ko ang babae kaya naman hinayaan ko na lamang. lumipas pa ang halos tatlumpong-minuto at papalapit na ako sa aking bababaan, pero hindi pa rin nagigising ang babae. kaya naman... - ako: ""madame? miss?"" babae: *medyo nagulat at parang naalimpungatan*. ako: *naka-ngiti* ""sorry. pero, kasi bababa na ako e."" babae: *nag sink-in na ata 'yung nangyari* ""ayyy... hala!! sorry kuya."" *napa-facepalm at hinagod ang buhok pataas* ""sorry talaga kuya."" ako: *ngumiti lang at tumango*. maya-maya pa nga ay pumara na ako at akmang tatayo nang napansin ko na kumikilos na rin ang babae na para bang bababa na rin. hindi nga ako nag-kamali. dahil noong huminto na ang fx ay bumaba na rin ang babae. habang nag-lalakad kami ay hindi ko mapigilang mapa-ngiti dahil maaring mag-kalapit lang ang aming pinag-tatrabahuhan o sa iisang building lang kami at iba lang ang kumpanya. hindi ko alam kung anong nangyayari, pero parang hindi ako maka-hinga na nilalamig na nangiginig na nang-hihina na ewan. hindi ko ma-ipaliwanag ang halo-halong nararamdaman ko sa mga oras na iyon. sa sobrang pag-iisip ko ng mga nararamdaman ko ay hindi ko namalayan nawala na pala s'ya sa paningin ko. kaya naman inikot ko ang aking paningin, pero hindi ko na s'ya makita. hindi ako makapag-focus sa trabaho noong gabing iyon dahil hindi mawala sa isip ko ang maganda n'yang mukha. simple lang s'ya, oo. pero, may kakaiba akong naramdaman na hindi ko ma-ipaliwanag. ilang linggo na rin ang nag-daan pero hindi ko na s'ya nakita pa sa fx o kahit saan pa sa pag-lalakad ko sa lugar malapit sa office namin. halos ala-una na noon at kaka-para ko lang ng fx. papa-upo na sana ako ng may biglang may sumunod na sumakay at tumabi sa akin. sa isang iglap tila baga'y tumigil ang mundo ko at ang mga kakatuwang pakiramdam ko noong una ko s'yang nakita ay isa-isang nagbabalikan. sa wakas. ang babaeng ilang linggo ko ring hinanap, muli ay katabi ko ulit. halos hindi ko mapigilan ang pangi-nginig nang katawan ko noong mga oras na iyon. hindi ko alam anong gagawin. (inner monologue: ""sir, kalma ka lang. hingang malalim, dahan-dahang exhale. ayaw mo naman siguro maamoy 'yan ng magandang babae sa tabi mo? tama? kalma. inhale-exhale. pakalmahin mo 'yang sarili mo sir, baka mahalata ka. ang pangi-nginig, kalmahan mo lang sir. kalma."") unti-unti nga ay napa-kalma ko rin ang sarili ko. pero hindi pa rin mawala ang mga kakatuwang pakiramdlam sa loob ko. habang nasa byahe at katabi ko s'ya ay hindi ko mapigilang mapa-tingin sa tabi ko. aaminin ko, umaasa ako na sana antukin s'ya, pero... hehe. mukhang naparami ata ang inom n'ya ng kape at hindi s'ya inaantok. sayang. ang quarenta 'y singkong byahe na iyon ay tila ba'y naging dalawa o tatlong oras. hindi ko alam bakit... hindi ko talaga alam. hanggang ngayon ay nangiginig na kinakapos pa rin ako ng hininga kapag naa-alala ko iyon. (madaling araw kasi, tsaka, medyo malamig dahil sa habagat. hehe). matapos nga ang halos tatlong oras... ay, quarenta 'y singko lang pala na byaheng iyon ay hindi ko na hahayaang mawala s'ya sa paningin ko ng hindi ko nalalaman kung saang kumpanya s'ya nag-tatrabaho. para hindi halata na naghihintay ako ay medyo pina-una ko muna s'ya mag-lakad at kunyari'y nag-sintas muna ako ng aking sapatos. nang nakita kong naglalakad na s'ya ay agad-agad naman akong lumakad sa hindi kalayuan. unti-unti ay parang mas bumibilis ang tibok ng dibdib ko at mas lumalakas ang pangi-nginig ng buong katawan ko na halos nang-hihina na hindi ko maintindihan. ilang minuto pa ang naka-lipas ay nakita ko s'yang papasok na sa isang building na halos tatlong kanto lang ang layo kung saan ako nag-tatrabaho. ngayon, alam ko na kung saan s'ya nag-tatrabaho. kaya naman binilisan ko na ang pag-lalakad dahil male-late na ako. ilang araw din akong naghintay at umasang makaka-sabay ko s'ya sa fx, pero, nga-nga. wala na naman. alas-dose 'y medya na noon ng tanghali at naglalakad na ako papunta sa bus terminal. pagdating ko sa terminal ay doon sa upuan nag-seselpon ang isang magandang babae. sa hindi kalayuan ay naka-tayo lang ako at nag-mamasid. nahuhuli ko ang sarili ko na naka-titig sa kanya na para bang s'ya lang ang babae o tao sa paligid ko. para bang lahat ng nasa paligid ko ay unti-unting lumalabo at s'ya lang ang nakikita ko. maya't-maya rin ang lingon ko sa paligid-ligid dahil baka isipin ng mga tao na mina-manyak ko na ang babae sa dating ng titig ko. maya-maya pa ay dumating na ang bus na sasakyan ko. medyo punuan noon dahil tanghali at nasa kala-gitnaan ng metro manila ang kumpanya namin. kaya naman, pagdating ng mga bus sa terminal ay halos wala ka nang mauupuan pa. gaya ng inaasahan, parang mga zombie na nag-takbuhan ang mga tao papa-lapit sa bus. bilang hindi naman ako nag-mamadali at rd (rest day) ko naman bukas, hindi na ako nakipag-digmaan pa sa bukana nang pinto ng bus. umalis na nga ang bus at tsaka lang pumasok sa isip ko ang babae. (inner monologue: sir?! anong ginagawa mo?! wala na. naka-sakay na 'yun. bob* naman natin e. ano? ilang linggo ulit 'yan? tang* put*. wala na). anak nang!!! nawala sa isip ko ang babaeng halos apat na buwan ko na ring sinusubay-bayan. (hinihintay o ina-abangan, panget kasi na term e. parang may balak akong masama). 😅 pagka-alis nga ng bus ay wala na rin sa kina-uupuan nito ang babae.

Pet Euthanasia,"kindly asking kung may alam kayo na vet or clinic na pwede mag euthanize ng pet? my baby (4 month old puppy - turning 5 on dec 26) was diagnosed with two types of cancer. one is leukemia due to the large amount of white blood cells and increased number of neoplastic cells. then sabi ng vet positive din for another type of cancer found in her red blood cells. we fought hard to keep her alive (spent a good amount of money just to get her the meds and tests she needed) honestly, oo gusto ko padin sya mabuhay nang matagal but unfortunately the signs are not really good na. she's slowly loosing her appetite. i've been force feeding her since the first week of november pa. lagi nalang sya nakahiga. tatayo at lalakad lang sya pag pupunta ng training pad to pee and poop. loose nadin yung bowel movement nya and may traces of blood nadin sa stool. may times padin na nakikitaan namin sya ng will to live. pag kinaka usap namin sya, nag wa-wag padin yung tail nya. lumalaban yung isip nya. pero gusto na yata bumigay ng katawan nya. ayoko sana gawin to pero if needed, saan ako pwede magpa euthanize for my baby? ang hirap sabihin. ang hirap gawin. masakit. sobra. pero baka kailangan ko na na sya i-let go. my faith is being tested. this is unfair. i did everything to take good care of her. complete vaccines, complete deworming sessions. getting her all the stuffs she needed. di ko pa pinapalabas ng house due to fear of viruses pero bakit yung baby ko pa yung pinahirapan ng ganito. she doesn't deserve this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/k8yxtp/pet_euthanasia/,8 12 2020
Anybody who had anal fissure/hemorrhoids?,"i have anal fissure for over a year now. una medyo nakakatakot lang kasi nagulat nalang ako na may dugo sa dumi ko, but it was painless. so it just kept happening, theres a bit of blood outside especially over the tail end of the poop but since it was painless hinayaan ko nalang. (napapa kris aquino ako kasi nanlalambot ako pag naiisip ko to hihi). pero isang beses nung nagtubol talaga ako grabe ang sakit, simula noon lahat na ng pagtae ko ang hirap, talagang pagpapawisan at paghahandaan mo ang pagpunta sa cr para makapagipon ng lakas kasi sobrang sakit talaga. the pain would never end there because after i pooped i can never sit straight for hours because of how sore my a-hole was. the only thing i could to relax do was lie down straight. after weeks or months there were periods na nagheal and i think it was back to normal relax pooping and i was relieved, but dumating nanaman ung significant na tubol tapos nag recur nanaman yung blood, and i knew from myself that tomorrow is going to be the start of pain. indeed it was. i have not visited any doctor yet, but the first time i saw blood i didnt tell my parents first pero nung naging concerning na sa akin sinabi ko na, kahit alam kong grabe takot nila. i only searched google for everything about my situation. di ko nga sure kung fissure or hemorrhoids eh. (shocked tlaga sila, kasi may history ng colon cancer line ni papa, si lola namatay due to that) so yon, aside from the pain, there is also the problem of rectal discharge na para bang sinisipon yung pwet (lalo na kapag masakit after pooping magdidischarge talaga. so its been weeks now since i have last encountered blood on my poop. nitong mga recent aftermath ng handaan, wala ring blood (yay) but the pain doesnt end yet. for some reason if i soap my anal area, it stings. i dont know why because i cant see down there pero internal ang fissure dba? so sinearch ko, tumungkol naman sa hemorrhoid wag daw sabunin kasi ma iirritate. ibig sabihin hemorrhoid naman problema ko ngayon, or did i really had both all along? this really changed the game of going to the toilet for me. i can never experience the ""comfort"" in comfort room ever again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/krb2hz/anybody_who_had_anal_fissurehemorrhoids/,5 01 2021

""ay shit, panalo na kami sa 24% kaya di na ako pupuntang rally"" ""di na ako nag-f-fact check"" eto ha. 1) over the past 6 weeks, never lumiit yung dami ng nag-h-h2h. nadagdagan pa kaming mga matatanda doon. at, guys gumagaling na yung mga bata huhuhuhu. i'm so proud of you. nagpapakilala, at umuupo-tinatabihan na po nila yung mga tao habang nag-e-explain at wala nang negative campaigning.. sa rallies ba kamo? lumiliit ba yung mga rally natin?! 2) have you seen our online war? guys di siya perfect ha. pero sumasalo na kaming mga diwa warriors and discord-ers. nakaka-oldest comments din naman kami sa neutral sites, and while baka di pa namin keri yung top relevant comment, yung top 3-10 ay laban leni-kiko naman.. 3) dito kamo sa reddit masyadong high sa pag-asa? totoo ba?! eh di bumababa yung number of posts na ""di talaga kayang iconvert yung tatay ko."" i have never at any point felt that we were leading. kahapon lang mga 4 ata yung on-the-same-day na lenikiko big events dito sa pasig. usually 2 lang na sityo yung pinupuntahan namin per day pero naka-5 kami kahapon dahil sa pausong tropasada na yan, ang itim-itim ko na :(. * **bawal magtanong tungkol sa pulse asia? bawal i-doubt? accept-accept lang?** here's the thing: kailangan siyang i-discuss kasi matalino kayong mga balbon. for example, sa discussions here on reddit, natuturuan tayo na 1) sample size is not the way to discredit pulse asia. true, while a 2.4k-2.6k sample is horrible at distinguishing a 1% candidate from a 2% candidate, it is amazing at saying that a 23% point estimate for one candidate is really below a 56% point estimate for another candidate. so move on tayo sa other things about survey companies. tanong tayo on stratified random sampling. tanong tayo on who owns pulse asia. sa discussions on reddit kasi lumalabas yung things like the fact that survey companies use third party vendors. who owns these naman? pulse asia obviously has a stringent sampling process (required na naka-document yung mga ganito at tinuturo sa mga surveyors), pero nasusundan ba? sop na somebody from the main company does a surprise visit during the process. nagagawa ba ito? surveys are a big weapon during elections so it's worth doing this. i don't want to this to be another vp-leni-saying-sorry-that-we-should-have-addressed-misinformation-against-her-earlier or wala-namang-troll-farms scenario again. gets ko, with 7 days to may-9 right now isn't the time to put effort into this, pero need siyang gawin later, so wag naman tayong mag-gate keep sa discussions. * **sabi ni baby ko na ako daw yung nang-g-gatekeep kapag naaasar ako sa mga events sa rockwell or yung mga pa-banda sa katipunan for leni na puro atenista**. o sige, i get it, even amongst ourselves we need to lift each other up. pero sana wag lang bili-bili lang ng leni merchandise (although inggit na inggit ako doon sa shiny jersey design \[so cool bro\] niyo kaso ang mahal at parang 500 pieces na lang na baller ang mabibili ko para sa mga leni-lugaw na bata). siguraduhin niyong nag-h2h din kayo or nag-d-digital warrior din kayo or nag-d-donate ha. kasi ang layo ng mga yan sa laylayan. \------- o yan, feeling ko tapos na ako sa pag-n-nega. plug lang ako ng: * may salubong/hatid sumilao farmers sa pasig tomorrow at 8am. sama kayo! :) * sa diwa you can sign up for a bot that will automatically send links on your fb, para click, heart/like article, heart/like friendly comments. super no brainer yung tasks and it's not a lot of effort po. sali po kayo! may discord server din po. * lastly, may mga h2h or flyering yang mga people's council niyo (for sure meron tomorrow) throughout the week. sama na po! o bukas ha, move-on na. siyempre lalaban yung kabila sa psy war. sige masakit, pero laban pa. ipanalo na10 to!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ugmryc/basta_bukas_move_on_na_guys_ha/,2 05 2022
Tagalized - Morgue.,"may nakita akong isang ad sa dyaryo, hindi man ako maka-paniwala at kinilabutan pero nakaka-anyaya ang sinasabi. ""gusto mo bang kumita ng 1000 pesos per night bilang security sa morge? apply na!"" medyo matagal na rin akong walang trabaho at makaka-bayad na rin ako ng upa at makapa-mamumuhay ng maginhawa kung magkataon. kaya naman nag-apply ako kahit medyo nag-dalawang-isip, inaasahan ko nang hindi ako makaka-kuha ng kahit anong sagot mula sa kumpanya. pero wala pang dalawang oras ay may natanggap akong email mula sa employer: ""maraming salamat sa ipinasa mong application form para sa posisyong night guard sa morge. masaya kong ibinabalita na ang mga skills na iyong binanggit ay tugma para sa hinahanap namin sa isang guard at gusto kitang offeran ng isang taong kontrata. kung ika'y sumasang-ayon sa mga kasunduan sa ibaba, maari lamang mag-iwan ka ng signature online via e-signature na naka-lista sa baba at pumunta ka sa (redacted) eksakto alas diyes ngayong gabi. makaka-tanggap ka ng 5000 linggo-linggo na direkta sa iyong bangko."" ngayong gabi? hindi ba masaydong mabilis ang mga pangyayari? pero hindi na ako nag-reklamo o tanong pa. hindi ko alam kung anong aasahan o kung sino ang madadatnan ko doon, kaya sinuot ko na 'yung damit at pantalon ko at agad nagtungo sa nasabing address nang mas maaga sa itinakdang oras. nandoon na ako ng mga alas nwebe kwarenta 'y singko ng gabi at may isang middle aged na lalaki na mukhang nag-tatrabaho sa morge ang bumati sa akin.

""tang... tinakot mo naman ako boss."" - sabi ko. tinignan n'ya ako na parang wala lang at bumalik sa ginagawa nito. ""akala ko umuwi na ang lahat. ako nga pala si michael, bagong gwardiya."" - sabi ko, gaya ng nauna, hindi n'ya ako pinansin. kumaway na ako at umalis pabalik ng office. babasahin ko na sana ulit ang mga rules ng biglang may matinis na tunog akong narinig na para bang may bakal na kumi-kiskis sa isa pang bakal na nag-eecho sa buong building. medyo mahina na ito at parang nang-gagaling sa mga tubo. tumagal din iyon ng ilang segundo at huminto sa kaparehas na segundo. hindi ko na lang pinansin at i-idlip na lang, check ng cell phone. pero medyo tumatagal na ang tunog at habang mas kinikilabutan ako ay unti-unti nang nagbabago ang kanina'y parang bakal na kumi-kiskis sa isa't-isa ay naging... ungol. lumabas ako ng office at tatanungin ko sana 'yung kaninang naka lab coat pero mukhang naka-uwi na s'ya sa mga oras na 'yun. hindi ako sigurado kung saan mismo nang-gagaling ang tunog, pero parang sa may crypt, kaya naman pinuntahan ko ito. 'yung oras na binuksan ko ang pinto ay ang buong building ay nanahimik. huminga ako ng malalim at napansin ko na 'yung isang chambers ay naka-bukas na ng bahagya. tinulak ko ito pabalik at agad-agad na bumalik sa office. nawala na ng tuluyan ang matinis na na para bang ungol na iyon. nagpatuloy ako sa pagbabasa: 3. maari kang matulog sa office, pero dapat handa ka sa mga mangyayari. sleep at your own risk, ika nga nila. matapos nun ay isang napaka-lakas na tunog ang halos mag-patalon sa buong pagkatao ko. ""tulong! palabasin n'yo ako dito!"" - ang boses ay tila nang-gagaling sa mga tubo. tumayo ako habang sobra ang kalabog ng dibdib ko. ""palabasin n'yo ako, hindi ako maka-hinga!"" - paulit-ulit na pagmama-kaawa ng boses na ngayon ay may kasama ng kalabog. binuksan ko ang pintuan ng office at sa hindi malaman na dahilan sa crypt nang-gagaling ang boses. nanginginig, pero binuksan ko ang pinto. ""buhay pa ako, isa itong pagkakamali! tulong!"" - mas lalong lumakas ang boses nung oras na buksan ko ang napaka-bigat at solidong pinto. ""asan ka?!"" - nanginginig akong tumingin sa paligid, habang ang walang humpay na tumatawag ang boses na may kasamang malalakas na kalabog. lumapit ako at unti-unting inilapit ang tenga para maka-siguro na ang bubuksan ko ay ang tamang chamber. ""buhay pa ako! utang na loob! ple----"" ang boses at ang mga kalabog ay daglian na lamang nawala nang biglaan kong binuksan ang isa sa mga chambers at sinalubong ako ng malamig na bangkay ng isang middle-aged na lalaki. tumayo lang ako doon, nakatitig sa bangkay, halos tumigil sa pagtakbo ang isip ko sa kung ano ang mga nangyayari. malinaw na malinaw kong narinig at naramdaman ko ang bawat kalabog nung oras na hinawakan ko ang hawakan ng chamber at para bang may kung sino man na bigla-bigla na lang nagpatigil nito. pinaglalaruan lang ba ako ng aking isipan? tinulak ko ang chamber pabalik at mabilis na umalis doon, nilock ang pinto ng office. iniisip ko na ang pag-aaply sa trabahong 'to ay maaring isang malaking pagkakamali. pakiramdam ko na nababaliw na ako, pero agad ko ring kinumbinse ang sarili ko na nasa ulo ko lang lahat ng 'to. nagpatuloy ako sa pagbabasa ng mg rules: 4. puwede kang mag-patugtog para maibsan ang katahimikan basta't hindi ito makaka-kuha ng atensyon sa labas. 5. kung may marinig kang hindi mo maipaliwanag na ingay galing sa may crypt, 'wag mo na lamang ito pansinin. 6. kung ang mga ingay na 'yun ay naging sigaw ng pagpapanic, gawin ang mga sumusunod: • kung ang mga sigaw ay mula sa babae, 'wag mo pansinin hanggang sa tumigil ito. 'wag na 'wag kang papasok sa loob ng crypt sa mga oras na nangyayari ito sa kahit anong dahilan. • kung ang mga ingay ay mula sa lalaki, hanapin ang pinag-mumulan ng ingay at hatakin ang chamber. dapat huminto na ang ingay pagkatapos mong mabuksan ang chamber. doon na nagtatapos ang page. nilapag ko na ang papel at dahan-dahang inilapat ang likod ko sa upuan. ala una na noon at nag-sisimula na akong antukin. maya-maya pa ay nagsisimula ng pumikit ang aking mga mata ng kusa. nagsisimula na akong mahulog sa panaginip nang biglang may mahigpit akong hawak na naramdaman sa likod ng aking balikat. sa sobrang gulat ko ay agad-agad akong napatayo at sinipa ang upuan. walang tao o kahit ano noong mga oras na iyon. hindi na ako inaantok nung mga oras na 'yun. tahimik na ang buong kapaligiran noon at nagpunta ako sa palikuran. pagbalik ko ay alas tres na at halos handa na akong tapusin ang shift ko dito. napagisip-isip ko na hindi na rin masama para sa isang libo, hanggang tinalikod ko ang papel na may mga rules at napansin kong may naka-sulat pa sa likod: 7. lahat ng staff ay lalabas o dapat nasa labas na ng building bago mag alas diyes ng gabi, kaya kung may makita kang lalaki na naka lab coat during your shift, 'wag na 'wag sa kahit ano mang sitwasyon na subukan mong makipag-usap sa kanya. paulit-ulit-ulit kong binasa ang rule ng limang beses, pero wala pa ring nagbabago sa naka-sulat. may mahinang katok sa pinto ng office. tinignan ko ito at sa likod ng salamin ay nakita ko ang lalaking naka lab coat naka-ngiti sa akin. alas kwatro 'y media na at patuloy pa rin s'ya sa pagkatok. sa mga magta-tanong, hindi ko na ho alam kung saan ko ito nakuha dahil 2018 ko pa po ito tinagalog. nakita ko lang na naka-save pa rin sa note ng selpon ko. salamat and ang init. tangina.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/t8j464/tagalized_morgue/,7 03 2022

and for those who claims na “agad-agad” daw yung project, well it’s not. it’s actually over a decade of urong-sulong because of the woke resistance: **january 4, 2016** – piston protested at the head office of the then-dotc. it wanted to make sure that the ltfrb and lto would accept the applications for registration of old jeepneys. former ltfrb chairperson winston ginez said a mandatory phaseout would begin in 2017. **(this was one of the earliest reports of cnn philippines about the matter. in 2012, the noynoy aquino administration pushed to introduce e-jeepneys. then-dotc secretary mar roxas said the age limits of puvs over time would be reduced. media reports said the phaseout plan has been issued by the dotc since 2002 but it was not seriously implemented.)** **september 21, 2016** – jeepney operators and drivers warned that they plan to hold a nationwide transport holiday if congress passed a bill that would approve the newly named department of transportation’s (dotr) plan to carry out the puv phaseout program, among other projects. the bill also pushed to give emergency powers to former president rodrigo duterte to solve the transport crisis. **february 6, 2017** – the stop and go coalition called for a nationwide transport strike, the first of many. it affected thousands of passengers and forced the cities of manila and malabon to suspend work and classes. it ended after the ltfrb called for a dialogue. the transport groups were reportedly unsatisfied with its results. **february 27, 2017** – the leaders of transport groups piston, stop and go coalition, and no to jeepney phase out coalition (njpoc) staged another nationwide strike, as a response to the government’s inaction to their appeal to amend the modernization program. some local government units in luzon and the visayas suspended classes, with malacañang also announcing a class suspension for metro manila on the eve of the strike. **june 19, 2017** – the ltfrb announced that the puv modernization program would start after a month under its order called omnibus franchising guidelines. aside from the phaseout, the program would stop giving franchises to single-unit operators. it was also reported that the government-affiliated land bank of the philippines had put up a ₱1-billion credit facility to cover the replacement of some 650 jeepneys, which would cost from around ₱1.4 million to ₱1.6 million per unit. days later, the department of trade and industry released possible designs for a prototype of the modern jeepney. after a few months, transport officials said that by 2020, all puvs would be modernized. **october 16-17, 2017** – jeepney drivers and operators led by piston staged another nationwide strike. the ltfrb claimed it received reports that it was part of a destabilization plot but the group denied the allegation. the ltfrb warned that it would cancel the franchises of operators who participated in the strike. traffic enforcers took photos of drivers who joined the protest, it added. during an event in camarines sur, duterte had some harsh words for members of piston and other protesters, warning them about serious consequences if they didn’t join the program. **december 5, 2017** – george san mateo, piston’s national president at that time, posted bail after he was arrested on dec. 1 for violating the commonwealth act no. 146, or the public service law. the case stemmed from the february piston-led strike. **december 11, 2017** – the senate committee on public service, led by sen. grace poe, conducted a hearing on the puv modernization program. poe said the ₱80,000 subsidy would not be enough to assist jeepney drivers as modern jeepneys cost ₱1.6 million each. but according to her own computation, each unit would actually cost ₱2.1 million at a 6% interest rate per annum if the payment period was seven years. groups led by piston planned to stage a week-long transport strike but called it off because of the hearing. they mounted transport caravans instead. **january 2, 2018** – the dotr said old jeepneys must meet government requirements as determined by a motor vehicle inspection system (mvis), or a roadworthiness test, before they could resume plying their routes until 2020. the agency also said jeepney units must be replaced with euro-4 compliant engines. **january 8, 2018** – transport officials started its tanggal bulok, tanggal usok campaign, where they issued warnings to smoke-belching vehicles and temporary operator’s permits for vehicles with defective parts and accessories. a month later, they cracked down on jeepneys at the university of the philippines diliman and issued citations to 95 drivers. the surprise operation affected students, teachers and employees. the dotr deployed only 10 solar-powered jeepneys to the campus. **march 19, 2018** – the ltfrb released a memorandum circular telling individual operators to join a cooperative or corporation that would operate more than 15 units, or group themselves to form a single juridical entity, by march 2019. this started the industry consolidation component of the puv modernization program. **october 8, 2018** – in a senate hearing, the ltfrb said it will postpone the implementation of the total puv phaseout originally set for march 2019, following opposition from senators and transport groups. but days later, then-transportation secretary arturo tugade said they would continue with the modernization program. **july 15, 2019** – alliance of concerned transport organizations (acto) and piston staged a protest, warning of another nationwide strike if their calls were ignored. efren de luna, acto’s president at that time, said in an earlier forum that they were not against the program but the phaseout had to be gradual. **september 30, 2019** – ltfrb’s then-chief martin delgra said around 18,000 puv units nationwide, including 5,642 jeepneys, had complied with the modernization program. the government is looking to modernize around 170,000 units. he also said the transition phase of the program would end by june 2020. transport groups claimed a successful nationwide strike on the same day. acto’s de luna said nine out of 10 jeepneys in major cities participated in the protest action. delgra reportedly vowed they would proceed with the program. **march 2020** – the enhanced community quarantine (ecq) or a total lockdown was implemented in luzon because of the covid-19 pandemic, crippling the transport sector. **june 2020** – transport group federation of jeepney operators and drivers association of the philippines (fejodap) expressed concern the government would use the covid-19 pandemic as an excuse to phase out jeepneys, after modern jeepneys were prioritized over traditional jeepneys and uv express units to resume operations. in july, provisional authorities of puv operators were extended until dec. 31, 2020. **december 18, 2020** – the ltfrb extended the franchise consolidation deadline to march 31, 2021. **march 29, 2021** – the ltfrb extended the franchise consolidation deadline until the lifting of the ecq. in april, the board gave provisional authority to drivers and operators valid for a year. in december, it opened the application for operators plying routes that have yet to consolidate until march 2022. **march 25, 2022** – in a memorandum circular, the ltfrb said the provisional authorities for traditional jeepneys will be valid until march 2023, to give them time for franchise validation. in september, the board also extended the deadline for operators plying routes that have yet to consolidate. **february 21, 2023** – the ltfrb extended the deadline for the franchise consolidation until june 30, as ltfrb chief teofilo guadiz iii revealed only about 60% of traditional jeepneys had been modernized. **february 27, 2023** – manibela chairperson mar valbuena said around 100,000 drivers and operators would stage a week-long, nationwide strike on march 6 to pressure the ltfrb into suspending the mandatory consolidation. he reiterated calls that the program must be humane and reasonable, and for the vehicles to be locally made. **march 1, 2023** – president ferdinand marcos jr. urged drivers to cancel the strike but he stressed the need to implement the modernization program in a “different way.” it was the first time he shared his sentiments on the matter after winning the elections. during his campaign, marcos said the dotr should modernize puvs by inspecting the vehicles’ condition and not simply basing it on age. in the afternoon, the ltfrb announced the extension of the franchise consolidation deadline, now set until dec. 31, to give the transport sector “more time to consolidate.” but manibela’s valbuena said the strike would still push through. **march 2, 2023** – in a hearing, senators urged transport regulators to indefinitely postpone the deadline of the franchise consolidation. sen. poe noted that the national government itself is not yet ready to implement the puv modernization program. **march 6, 2023** – in anticipation of the possible effects of the transport strike, various cities and schools, mostly in metro manila, announced the shift to online and asynchronous classes. libreng sakay trips were also prepared. however, malacañang said many of the country's transport groups were not participating. **december 31, 2023** – this is the last day for drivers and operators to consolidate. **2024** – the second component of the puv modernization program will start. so sinong nagkulang? hindi totoong lahat ay pabor sa modernization, kagaya nung sinasabi nila. maraming jeepney drivers at operators ang ayaw talaga nito dahil hindi na nila magagawa yung mga kabalastugan na ginagawa nila noon. marami sa kanila ang may “pwede na yan, tumatakbo pa naman” mindset at ayaw mamuhunan dahil “nakasanayan” na. marami ding pasahero ayaw ng pagbabago dahil ayaw din nila gumastos o dahil kesyo kultura daw. adapt or die. we are in a capitalistic society whether we like or not, and jeepney like everything else is a transport business, “not a charity”. hindi kasalanan ng iba na humingi ng convenience, same way na hindi kasalanan ng mga tao kung bakit itong mga jeepney drivers na ito ay mawawalan ng trabaho kung sakaling matuloy man ang phase out. nilulugar dapat ang empathy at rules and regulation. hindi maaaring puro, pwede na lang. sa daan patunong progresong lipunan, masakit mang tanggapin, pero meron talagng collateral at masasagasaan. that’s how it is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/11komzv/a_hard_pill_to_swallow_pero_need_talaga/,7 03 2023
Tagalized Story.,"may story ako. ako lang ang nag-iisang babae sa pinag-tatrabahuhan kong kumpanya at alam ko na kung bakit. isa akong fresh graduate sa kolehiyo at gusto ko na talagang makapag-simula ng career agad-agad na walang kinalaman sa pagse-serve ng pagkain, pagpupunas ng mga gamit, o pag-dadala o timpla ng kape sa isang matandang negosyante. sa naka-sanayan nag-aapply ako sa trabaho na may anim na araw na trabaho at marami-rami na rin akong interview na napagdaanan. alam ko na ang tinapos kong hrm na kurso ay hindi gaanong makaka-kuha ng magandang oportunidad, pero naniniwala pa rin ako na may mas maganda pang trabaho na naghihintay sa akin. kaya naman nanatili akong positibo, matyaga, at nag-aapply lang sa mga office jobs na may magandang benipisyo. kahit halos wala na akong mapag-kunan ng makakain dahil sa magastos na mga interview, at least mapapag-tibay naman nito ang kakaunting pride na natitira sa akin. halos tatlong linggo na rin ang nakalipas, may isa akong phone interview sa isang internet security company. ang kumpanyang iyon ay maraming offices sa amin at naghahanap sila ng bagong customer support specialist para sa kanilang international department. ang mga requirements ay maganda o mahinahon na boses, good spoken and written grammar, kakaunting tech-knowledge, at may kakayahang mag-trabaho sa umaga at gabi. ang office ay dalawang sakay lang sa mula sa amin, at mayroon silang magandang offer sa health insurance. nag-aapply ako kahit lmitado lang din ang alam ko sa computer science. naging maayos naman ang phone interview at matapos ang dalawang meetings sa hr at sa management, binigyan nila ako ng isang napaka-gandang offer (kahit na wala pa talaga akong experience sa kahit anong trabaho). sa loob ng unang linggo ko, kailangan kong magtrabaho nang regular shift na 9-5 (am) para maging online ako kasabay ng manager ko, na nag-trabaho sa ibang branch ng kumpanya. pagkatapos noon ay kailangan kong magtrabaho para sa regular na schedule ko bilang support - ang schedule ko ay 6 na araw na pasok (09:00 am -05:00 pm (am) at may isang araw na night shift 09:00 pm - 05:00 am respectively). sa unang araw ko, ang suot ko ay isang loose na sweater at mahabang skirt. bilang sa kaalaman ko ay sa ganitong uri ng trabaho ay karamihan mga lalaki ang empleyado, ayaw ko naman mag-cause ng unnecessary attention dahil sa provocatively o inappropriately pag-susuot ng hindi naayon na attire. ang lalaki sa front desk ay mukha namang maayos na tao. pinakilala n'ya ang sarili n'ya bilang si andrew bago n'ya ako tulungang mag-fill out ng mga paperwork at sinamahan n'ya na ako sa aking mesa at sa isang open space na workspace. nakatitig lang ako sa tila walang katapusang mga desks habang naglalakad kami, napansin ko na halos hindi mo makikita ang mga mukha ng bawat taong nagta-trabaho na naka-upo sa bawat desks. wala man lang akong nakita o napansin na babae habang nag-lalakad kami sa tila baga'y walang katapusang workspace na iyon, na talaga namang hindi normal at nakaka-bahala. kahit ang kalmadong presensya ni andrew ay hindi kayang maiwaglit ang wari kakaibang pakiramdam na naka-tuon sa akin. halos maubusan ako ng hininga ng maramdaman ko ang mga presensya ng bagong kong co-workers na tila nagsasabi na ""hindi ka nababagay dito"". nagulat ako ng biglang huminto si andrew sa isang desk na napuno ng mga printed memes, floral stickers, at isang lumang keychain na naka-patong sa harap ng monitor. bukod pa doon ay natatakpan na rin ng makapal na alikabok ang keyboard, monitor at ang natitirang ispasyo ng desk. ""ahhh... anong nangyari..."" sabi ni andrew sa medyo upset na boses. ""pasensya ka na."" sabi nito habang nakatingin sa aking mga papeles. ""ah... aya. dapat matagal na 'tong nalinis. kailangan kong maka-usap ang custodian"". ""ok lang 'yun"", sagot ko. ""puwede ko namang punasan na lang 'yan, wala namang problema"". medyo asiwa na noon si andrew, pero habang ginagala ko ang aking paningin ay malinaw na wala ng ibang bakanteng desk maliban doon. mabilis na natapos ang araw na iyon. natutunan ko na ang mga dapat kung gawin na sumagot sa support related phone calls at gumawa ng bagong ticket para sa system. kailangan ko ring i-monitor ang lahat ng pumapasok na chats at written tickets at isaayos ito base sa level ng urgency at type nito. hindi naman ako required mag-bigay ng technical advice, pero dapat maging pamilyar ako sa aming product software. bilang wala pa namang mga tawag ay pinaki-alaman ko muna ang manual. halos wala akong maintindihan sa mga naroon kaya naman ginogle ko na lang ang karamihan na nasa manual. kinumusta ako noon ng manager ko at mukhang hindi s'ya masaya sa mga lapses ko sa mga materials. dahil pakiramdam ko wala akong matinong nagawa at gagawin sa mga oras na iyon ay panandalian akong nag-break para linisin ang mesa ko. tumayo ako para tanungin si andrew kung saan makaka-kuha ng basahan para sa mesa ko. agad-agad kong pinagsisihan ang desisyon kong iyon. ang bawat mata sa kwarto ay tila napako sa pagtayo ko sa aking kinauupuan. hindi ako sigurado pero maraming mga bulungan akong narinig habang papalayo ako sa aking mesa. ang kaninang maingay na mga keyboard ay pahina nang pahina na halos kainin na ako ng lupa sa sobrang hindi ko pagiging kumportable at self-conscious na rin at the same time. napansin ko na lang na halos halikan ko na ang dibdib ko sa pagyuko para lang hindi ako mapansin. bago ako maka-rating sa isang palikong daan patungo sa front desk ay buong-lakas kong tinignan ang isang tila walang hiyang lalaki na nakatitig sa akin. hindi ko alam kung ano ang inaasahan ko, pero 'yung overall appearance ng lalaking naka-hooding pang-asar na 'yun ay nagbigay ng matinding kilabot sa buong katawan ko. siguro mga ka-edad ko s'ya pero hindi man lang s'ya nahiya o natinag sa pagkaka-titig n'ya sa akin sa kabila ng pagtitig ko sa kanya na may halong pagka-bwisit at inis. isang kakila-kilabot na ngiti ang sumilaw sa mga labi nito habang naka-titig sa parteng bukong-bukong ng aking mga paa at dahan-dahan itong bumalik sa kanyang monitor. inisip ko kung anong magiging reaksyon n'ya kapag tinitigan ko rin ng kaparehong paraan ng pagtitig n'ya sa akin ang tinitigyawat n'yang leeg. parehong reaksyon pa rin ang nakuha ko habang naglalakad ako pabalik sa aking mesa kasama ang box ng computer wipes sa mga kamay ko. may maganda ring nangyari sa araw na iyon. habang nililinis ko ang mga drawer ng mesa ko ay may nakita akong half-used notebook mula sa nakaraang nagta-trabaho sa mesa ko. hindi n'ya nilagay ang first name n'ya, kundi initial lang at last name: j. espiritu. pero, base sa dekorasyon ng notebook, sigurado ako na babae rin s'ya kagaya ko. ang mga naiwan n'yang gamit ay nagbigay ng kapanatagan sa akin, pero 'yung notebook ang talagang pumukaw ng atensyon ko. doon ay sinabi nito ang pina-ikli at simpleng manual gamit ang easy-to-undertand terms at mga explenasyon sa nakaka-litong terminolohiya at komplikadong panuto sa manual. sa tulong n'ya ay nasurpresa ko ang aking manager sa aking product knowledge pagkatapos ng shift ko. matapos ang isang magandang araw ay buong tapang akong gumala sa office at nag-explore sa pantry. binenta ni andrew sa akin ang top-notch coffee machine at snacks sa nasabing pantry, tutal nagugutom na rin naman ako matapos ang isang emotionally, intellectually and productive na araw na 'yun. (ansabe). tsaka, medyo butas na rin 'yung bulsa at namumula na ang mga credit cards ko, kaya naman ayos na ako sa ilang pirasong masasarap na cookies. habang papalapit ako ay may narinig akong malakas na usapan at tawanan sa pantry. sa katangahan ko ay inisip ko na baka naman mas mainit, friendly o kahit maka-tao na sila sa akin. subalit ang maliit na pantry ay napuno ng katahimikan the moment na pumasok ako sa pantry. may limang lalaki doon na mag-kakaiba ang edad at lalaki na naka-upo sa palibot ng isang maliit na lamesa, at lahat sila ay naka-titig na direkta sa akin. ""panget na araw?"" - tugon ng isang pang-asar na boses. agad kong itinaas ang ulo ko mula sa pagkaka-titig sa sahig para hanapin ang pinag-mulan ng boses. hindi naging mahirap sa aking hanapin at malaman na mula iyon sa naka-hoodie na walang-hiyang tumitig sa akin nung nakaraan lang. ""siguro marami ka ng experience?"" - sambit pa nito sa nakaka-asar na tono at may-unting pag-taas ng kilay. ""para makakuha ng komportableng trabaho. siguro sikat ka?"". ""ano 'to, high-school?"" - sagot ko sa malakas na boses. hindi ko hilig kumompronta ng tao, pero sobra na 'to. hostility is one thing, social awkwardness is another, pero pakiramdam ko isa 'tong 80's na high-school drama na mga trenta anyos ang mga bida bilang mga teenagers. ""nandito lang ako para kumuha kape at kung may problema ka sa trabaho ko, puwede mong dalhin sa hr kung ano man ang issue mo"". nagpatuloy ako habang ine-enjoy ang namumutla at pahiyang mukha ng mga taong 'yun. mabuti naman, gusto kong maramdaman nila ang katiting na discomfort na buong araw kung kinakaharap. pinili kong lumayo sa aking mga co-workers, naglakad ako ng taas noo pabalik sa mesa ko na may hawak-hawak na tasa ng kape. bago pa ako maka-upo at enjoyin ang masarap na kape, napansin kong may isang mensahe galing sa hindi kilalang number: ""you have quite an attitude, don't you?"" nanigas ako habang hawak ang cell phone sa isa kong kamay at kape sa kabila. habang prino-proseso ko ang tila breach sa personal security ko, naka-tanggap ulit ako ng dalawa pang mensahe. isa ay ang hubo't-hubad kong katawan na sinend ko sa una kong serious college boyfriend. ang pangalawa: ""bakit hindi mo ngayon ibigay 'yang picture sa hr?"" sa totoo lang, sobrang naapektuhan ako sa invasion ng privacy ko. pumasok ang kahihiyan sa akin at sobrang naiinis ako for drawing so much unwanted attention sa sarili ko. kasalanan ko lahat 'to. pumasok ako sa isang office na puno ng ethical hackers na may pare-parehong pangalan ng aso bilang password. walang duda na ang litratong iyon ay umiikot na sa buong office at lahat ng iyon ay salamat sa walang hiyang ka-trabaho ko, at isa na akong kakatuwang tao sa loob ng office. hindi ko na ginalaw ang kape ko at umuwi na lang, habang pinipigilan ko ang bawat emosyon na bumuhos hanggang makarating ako sa safety ng bahay. halos hindi ako matigil sa kaiiyak nung gabing 'yun, iniisip ko na ang mga mukha ng mga ka-trabaho ko habang tigang na tigang na nakatitig sa hubad kong katawan. mga alas tres na ng madaling araw, doon ko lang na-realize na wala ng kwenta para pa magpaka-lunod ako sa kahihiyan. kailangan kong gumawa ng plano para maka-survive sa ganitong uri ng workplace. quitting is not an option kasi masyadong malaki ang pasweldo nila para tumigil ako. tsaka, halos tinapay na lang ang kaya kong bilhin sa araw-araw. ang pangalawa kong option ay pumunta sa hr, but there's no way i was going to open that can of worms. hindi ko mapapatunayan kong sino talaga ang nag-send ng mga mensahe na iyon. last option? stick with it, keep my head down, gawin ang trabaho na pinasukan ko at 'wag pansinin ang iba pang mga harassment na gagawin nila. 'yun nga ang ginawa ko. sa kabuuan ng isang linggong training ko ay pumapasok ako on time, hindi ako umaalis sa desk ko liban na lang kung pupunta sa palikuran. iniwasan ko rin ang kahit anong contact kanino man at pinanatili ko lang ang aking mga mata sa mga inanimate objects. salamat kay j. espiritu, palagi akong on top ng training ko. sa bawat bagong task na galing sa manager ko, laging may katumbas na entry sa kanyang notebook. wala ng nakaka-gagong texts at face-to-face na kumprontasyon, pero mayroong kakatuwang pakiramdam na panibagong sisira sa kalagayan ko. sa darating na biyernes na ang huling training ko, na nagdala sa akin sa huling entry sa notebook. night shift survival guide: - matulog sa buong umaga bago ang shift at 'wag na 'wag kang matutulog. - walang sino man ang dapat maka-pasok. - panatilihing may pepper spray na dala. (sa kahit anong sitwasyon). - i-check ang bawat aisle, meeting rooms. huwag kalimutang i-check ang ilalim ng lamesa, balkonahe, kitchen tables at kahit likod ng cooler. - laging mag-open ng skype na naka-ready sa emergency in case na hindi gumana ang mobile services. - panatilihing updated sa kaibigan/pamilya/lover kada oras. ang nasabing listahan ay medyo may kahulugan. una, sabi ng hr puwede naman akong matulog sa pagitan ng 2-5 am, basta malapit palagi sa akin ang office smartphone. mayroon nga silang pull out couch sa isang conference room para lang talaga sa ganitong sitwasyon. pangalawa, ang buong shift ay phone calls, kaya palaging may paraan para maka-tawag mula sa office phone, tama? lastly, ang mga naka-outlined sa ""guide"" ay parang o.a at paranoid. siguro 'yung listahan ay satirical? (ewan ko). siguro si espiritu parehas kami ng pakiramdam tungkol sa mga tila patay gutom na mga asong cold-blooded na co-workers? pero 'yung isip ko nag-tatrabaho ng sobra-sobra para makita ang logic sa likod ng mga pag-iingat na ito. may kakatuwa akong pakiramdam na may importanteng impormasyon akong hindi nalalaman. lahat 'yun iniisip ko habang paalis ako ng bahay nung biyernes na 'yun, last day ng training ko. ""andrew"", - dahan-dahan akong lumapit sa kanya. ""puwede ba mag-tanong?"" ""sure thing"", - sagot n'ya na may maaliwalas na ngiti sa kanyang mga labi. ""nagtataka lang ako, bakit wala akong nakikitang ibang support agents. i mean, 'di ba dapat merong at least lima pang tao para ma-cover 'yung six-day rotation cycle?"" ""kailangan mong tanungin ang manager mo tungkol d'yan. most likely naka-kalat sila sa iba pang branch sa syudad. normal lang naman 'yun sa ganoong kaso"", - sagot n'ya. pakiramdam ko tapos na kami sa diskusyon na 'yun matapos s'yang bumalik sa final tasks n'ya para sa linggong iyon. ""meron bang ibang agent na nag-trabaho dito liban sa akin?"" - pagpapatuloy ko, dahil ganun na lamang ang kagustuhan kong malaman ang iba pang detalye sa babaeng nag-fill out ng notebook na s'ya namang ginagamit ko sa buong linggong iyon. ""oo, may isang babae na humawak sa posisyon mo ng panandalian"", - ani ni andrew, habang naka-titig pa rin sa screen ng kanyang screen. pero napansin kong tumigil na s'ya sa pag-tatype o pag-galaw ng mouse. wari ko ay naka-titig lang s'ya sa iisang spot sa monitor n'ya. ""andrew"", - nag-salubong ang mga kilay ko. ""sino 'yung nag-trabaho malapit sa main working space na talagang nakaka-inis? maputla, medyo payat, maitim at kulot na buhok?"" - tanong ko, habang nagpapaikot ng daliri sa bandang ulunan ko para i-describe ang pagkaka-kulot ng nasabing lalake. ""ah... si michael"", - sagot nito, napansin nito ang pagiging iritable ng boses ko. ""may problema ba? ginugulo ka ba n'ya?"" ""hindi"" - sagot ko, pero sa isip-isip ko ay nagtatalo na ang emosyon at sarili ko. ""have a good weekend, andrew"" ""ikaw din"", - sagot nito, halata na may pagtataka sa boses nito habang papaalis ako. sa buong weekend na 'yun ay binabalik-balikan ko ang mga nangyari sa akin sa unang linggo ko. pakiramdam ko may hindi sinasabi si andrew sa akin na importante. wala namang rason para maging iretable s'ya nung nabanggit ko 'yung babaeng nag-trabaho bago ako. may nag-reklamo na kaya kay michael dati? pu-puwede kayang si j. espiritu? si michael ba ang dahilan ng survival guide sa notebook? bakit s'ya umalis? napaka-daming teorya ang bumagabag sa buong weekend ko. bago ko pa nalaman, oras na para bumalik sa trabaho. ito ang araw na talagang sobrang daming trabaho. kahapon ay lunes, ang unang regular day shift. mabilis lang dumaan ang nasabing araw, habang aligaga ako sa pag-sagot ng tawag, recording, sorting at assigning ng dose-dosenang customer complaints sa system namin. hindi sapat ang salitang nasanay na ako at pagkatapos ng araw na 'yun ay sobrang pagod at ubos na ako. saktong maglo-logout na ako, naka-tanggap na naman ako ng mensahe mula sa hindi kilalang number. ""ang sipag mo naman. hindi na ako makapag-hintay na mag night shift ka"" seryoso?! ito ang kauna-unahang mensahe na bumalot sa buong pagkatao ko ng takot. agad-agad kong ginala ang paningin ko kung nasa paligid ba si michael para kumprontahin ko s'ya sa pagse-send ng mensahe, pero kanina pa pala s'ya umalis. matapos kong pakalmahin ang sarili ko, umuwi na ako at sinusubukan kong hanapin si j. espiritu online. ang pinaka best bet ko noon ay sa linkedin, at doon nga ay sinusubukan kong galugarin ang buong listahan ng mga babae na may kinalaman sa proficient technologies na naka-lagay sa profile nila (halos kakaunti lang talaga sila). nung wala akong makita ay pumunta ako kay andrew at doon nga sa friend list n'ya ay sa wakas nakita ko na ang hinahanap ko. may babae na pangalan ay jennah espiritu at unemployed ang status. nag-send ako ng friend request na may mensahe na nag-papakilala at tinanong ko s'ya kung hinarass ba s'ya ng isa n'yang ka-trabaho. sa wakas, pakiramdam ko may patutunguhan na ako, natulog ako at inihanda ang sarili para sa bukas na event. naisip ko na baka may kakaibang mangyayari dahil sa pagbabago ng schedule nung natulog ako ng miyerkules. nag-check ako ng linkedin halos pagka-gising ko mga ala una. walang kahit anong sign kay jennah, kaya naman natulog ulit ako para makapag-handa sa night shift. medyo kinakabahan ako at excited at the same time kasi puwede ko ng mas malibot ang buong place of work ko intimately. dahil walang day crowd, malaya akong makaka-gala at ma-eenjoy ang cookies, dumura sa baso ni michael, kahit ano! may mga iilan pa ring mga nag-tatrabaho nung dumating ako para sa shift ko, pero hindi ko naman iyon pinansin at dahil sa nag-uumapaw na mga tawag at chats na aasikasuhin. makalipas ang dalawang oras, ang bugso ng mga tawag at chats pati mga tickets ay unti-unting bumagal hanggang tuluyan na nga itong tumigil ng sabay-sabay halos alas onse na ng gabi noon. sumandal ako sa kinauupuan ko at ginala-gala ang mga paningin sa aking workspace. wala ng tao noon sa office at least sa nakikita ko. naka-bukas ang lahat ng ilaw pero nung tinanggal ko ang headphones ko, may narinig akong mahinang jingling melody sa hindi kalayuan. para s'yang christmas carol, pero hirap akong tukuyin kong saan ito nangga-galing. wala namang dahilan para matakot ako sa pangyayari, pero pakiramdam ko ang mga nagtayuang balahibo sa mga kamay ko ay nagsilbing alarm. nang tumayo ako sa aking kinauupuan, nawala 'yung melody. well, naging paranoid na ako dati. minsan ko ng inisip na na may lalaking sumusunod sa akin isang gabi hanggang nilagpasan n'ya ako at nagtungo sa kalapit na tindahan sa 'di kalayuan. kahit mag-isa lang ako, lagi kong dino-double at triple check ang mga lock ng bahay bago matulog. aaminin ko na ang mga takot ko ay wala naman talagang basehan. mayroong naka-iwan ng headphones na konektado pa rin sa computer nito at naka-on ang music. o siguro may office party sa ibang kumpanya sa baba ng building. ang makarinig ng kanta ay nakaka-takot lamang sa mga kakatuwang horror movies, 'di ba? 'di ba?! para maka-siguro, hinalughog ko ang office para maka-siguro na mag-isa na nga lang ako. habang naglalakad sa gitna ng mga magkaka-dikit na desks, naisip ko kung gaano ako ka-swerte na mayroon akong sariling corner spot. hindi ko siguro kakayanin na mapalapit sa kahit sinong mga hindi kaaya-aya kong mga co-workers. matapos ko ma-check ang bawat rows ay dumiretcho ako sa front desk area at nagmamasid sa mga kagamitan ni andrew sa paghahanap ng clues. nung wala akong makitang clues ay bumalik ako sa main room ng pantry. unti-unti ng mas nagiging relaxed ang mga senses ko at tsaka ko lang napag-tanto na napasarap ata ang taste-testing ko sa mga cookies sa halip na mag-hanap ng mga kahina-hinalang mga bagay. kailangan ko ng tumigil sa kaka-kain ng cookies, pero dahil bumalik na naman ang kaninang tunog na naririnig ko, mas malakas s'ya ngayon. at the same time, ang work smartphone ko (na kinakailangan dala-dala namin kung aalis kami sa aming work station) tumunog at may mensahe mula sa hindi na namang kilalang number. so, nag-eenjoy ka ba sa cookies, ha? nanigas ang buong katawan ko habang prino-proseso ng utak ko ang mga pangyayari. siguro hindi talaga umalis ng office si michael at ngayon tinatakot ako. kinalikot ko ang tenga ko noon at nakinig ng maigi. walang kahit sino sa pantry as least sa nakikita at naririnig ko. tsaka, kung si michael ay nasa main workspace, hindi naman ganun kahirap na hulaan o sabihin na kumakain ako ng cookies. habang dahan-dahan akong humihinga, hindi ko muna pinansin ang tunog at nakinig ako ng maigi kung may iba pa akong tunog na maririnig. wala. dahan-dahan, naglakad ako sa may pantry drawers at doon may nakita akong malaking kutsilyo. alam ko bang gumamit ng kutsilyo? hindi. kaya ko kayang paalisin kung sino man ang unarmed na kalaban? syempre. papunta na sana ako pabalik sa aking work station ng biglang may tawag na pumasok mula sa work phone. ipinosisyon ko ang sarili ko ng kumportable sa pader ng pantry, kutsilyo sa kanang kamay, cell phone sa kabila, bago pa ako maka-sagot with the standard customer support greeting. nag static na sa kabilang linya at iba pang ingay sunod ang tuluyang pagka-putol ng linya at katahimikan. nung tinignan ko ang cell phone, nakita kong naka-patay na ito. sinubukan kong buksan ulit ito, pero hindi na ito gumagana. ok, ngayon kailangan ko ng bumalik sa computer ko in case na may pumasok pang mga tawag. naalala ko bigla ang isa sa mga guide na galing kay jennah habang isinusuksok ko ang walang kwentang cell phone sa bulsa ko. - laging mag-open ng skype na naka-ready sa emergency in case na hindi gumana ang mobile services. nangyari rin kaya 'to sa kanya? ang mga instructions sa notebook ay unti-unti ng nagkaroon ng kahulugan, at minumura ko ang sarili ko dahil sa pagiging tanga. sa oras na lumabas ang mga salita sa bibig ko ay may isa na namang mensahe ang dumating sa cell phone. kinuha ko iyon at sinubukang i-unlock, pero 'yung regular home screen ay hindi lumalabas. ang lumabas lang ay isang white screen na may maikling text. putang ina. ang mga babae dapat hindi ginagamit ng ganung mga uri ng salita. matapos kong mabasa 'yun ay nawala na ito sa screen at may panibagong text ang lumabas. bakit hindi ka lumabas at makipag-laro? huwag mo ng isiping bitbitin pa 'yang kutsilyong hawak mo. wala ring magagawa 'yan sa hawak kong baril. tinapon ko ang cell phone ko sa lapag at agad-agad ay nagtungo ako sa aking computer. ang tunog ay mas lalong lumakas habang papalapit ako sa aking lamesa, doon ay nakita kong may isang baboy na stuffed toy. may fabric button ito sa bandang paanan at music note na kasama. dito nagmumula ang tunog at nagpapatunay lamang na hindi ako mag-isa at may kung sino akong kasama. ang malala pa, pinapanood nila ang bawat galaw ko at sinusubukang takutin gamit ang mga laruang pambata. unti-unti ng dumadaloy ang pagpapanic sa aking buong katawan at naghahanda na sa fight or flight scenario. huminga ako ng malalim, sinusubukan kong pakalmahin ang buong katawan ko. so far wala pa naman akong naririnig ng kahit anong palatandaan na may ibang tao sa loob ng office. may mga background noises galing sa syudad sa labas at ang mga ingay mula sa naka-limutang patayin na computer ng isang employee. kung sino man ang gumagawa nito sa akin, kailangan kong malaman ang kanilang eksaktong lokasyon para maplano ko ng maayos ang pag-takas ko. isa pa, kailangan kong maka-kuha ng tulong sa lalong mas madaling panahon. habang iginigilid ko ang laruan ay umupo na ako sa aking upuan at pinull-up ang skype for business application. mabilis akong nag-dial ng 911, habang naka-loudspeaker ang telepono. tumunog na nga ang dial tone at agad-agad ay may live operator na sa kabilang linya. ibibigay ko na sana ang mga hindi kanais-nais na pangyayari sa akin ng mga oras na iyon ng may biglang humawak sa bukong-bukong ko mula sa ilalim ng lamesa. halos maubos ang buong lakas ko sa pagsigaw habang nagpu-pumiglas ang mga paa at mabilis na tumakbo sa abot ng aking makakaya sa bilis na hindi ko akaling kaya ko. may narinig akong kung anong kumusyon sa aking likuran habang tumakbo, kasunod ng isang malakas ng putok, na inisip ko na lamang na galing sa kung ano o sino man ang humahabol sa akin. bago ko pa malaman ay halos nasa ground floor na ako papunta sa pinto lagpas sa gwardiya na halatang nagulat sa mga nangyayari. ang malamig na hangin ay mabilis na pumasok sa manipis kong sweater habang papalapit ako sa isang malapit na pedestrian para humingi ng tulong. tumawag sila ng 911 at ang mga pulis ay agad namang dumating wala pang sampung minuto. habang naghihintay ako kasama ang gwardiya para sa kanilang pag-dating, hindi maalis sa isip ko ang sinulat ni jennah na warning, at kung gaano ako ka-tanga para ipagsa walang bahala ang mga ito. - i-check ang ang bawat aisle, meeting room. huwag kalimutang i-check ang ilalim ng lamesa, balkonahe, kitchen tables at kahit likod ng cooler. agad-agad namang sinulat ng pulis ang mga nangyari sa akin at iniwan ako kasama ang isang pulis officer, umakyat s'ya para i-check ang office. wala namang naka-labas-masok sa building mula nung tumakbo ako palabas, kaya malaki ang posibilidad na naroroon pa rin ang salarin at nagtatago sa loob. sa pag-iisip ay halos bumaliktad ang buong sikmura ko at mas lalo akong lumapit sa may armas kong kasama. maya-maya pa matapos kaming iwanan ng mga pulis, ang kasama kong pulis ay nag-radyo at isa-isa may mga boses na nagpapa-palit-palit sa radyo na humingi ng backup at nga mga codes na hindi ko maintindihan. mabilis na nag-escalate ang mga sumunod na pangyayari. imbis na pauwi ay dinala nila ako sa police station at doon ay nanatili ako sa isang interrogation room ng halos 2 oras bago pa sa wakas may dalawang pulis officer ang kumausap sa akin. pagod na ako noon, miserable ang kalagayan at higit sa lahat litong-lito sa kung papaano naganap ang mga pangyayari. gusto ko ng umuwi pero nanatili pa ako ng ilang oras para i-kuwento ang mga pangyayari sa dalawang pulis officer. 'ahh... meron kang kutsilyong hawak habang tumakbo ka galing sa pantry papunta sa lamesa mo? sigurado ka ba?' tanong ng isang nakaka-tandang officer na nagpakilala bilang senior investigator manlapig. 'ah. ah... oo.' pautal-utal kong sagot sa kanya. 'naniniwala akong meron. nag-papanic na ako noon, kaya mahirap sabihin. tapos may baboy na stuffed toy, ' sabi ko, habang tila baga'y nawawalan ako ng abilidad na mag-isip ng tama. 'at naniniwala ka na ang taong humaharass sa'yo ay si michael villareal?' sabi ng isa pang officer, hindi ko maalala 'yung pangalan n'ya. wala s'yang badge. 'hindi ko alam buong pangalan n'ya, pero wala na akong ibang kilala na iba pang responsable.' 'at sa huling pagkakataon, just for the record, anong nangyari matapos mong mag-dial ng 911?' tanong ni manlapig sa ika-apat na pagkakataon sa gabing 'yun. 'may kung sino ang humawak sa binti ko. bukong-bukong, actually. nangyari 'yun bago pa ako magkaroon ng pagkakataong ipaliwanag ang sitwasyon sa operator. nagsusumigaw at piglas ang mga paa ko tapos tumakbo hanggang may makita akong tao sa labas na pina-tawag ako sa 911 para sa tulong.' sagot ko, habang pagod na pagod sa paulit-ulit at paikot-ikot na pagtatanong. 'si michael villareal ay natagpuang patay sa hindi kalayuan ng iyong lamesa nung pumunta ang officer namin sa pinang-yarihan ng insidente. nakita mo ba ang kanyang katawan nung tumakbo ka palabas ng office?' tanong ng isang officer. halos malaglag ang panga ko sa mga narinig ko at tumitig sa dalawang pulis habang balisa at nanginginig sa takot. 'hi.. hi.. hindi,' pabulong akong nag-salita, 'hindi ko maintindihan,' 'sinaksak s'ya hanggang sa mamatay gamit ang malaking kutsilyo. ang katawan n'ya ay balot ng dalawampu't-tatlong saksak,' paliwanag ni manlapig. 'at nakita namin ang kutsilyo ay nakabaon sa bibig nito, dahilan para dumikit ito sa sahig diretcho sa lalamunan,' 'may rason kami para pagsuspetyahan na ito rin ang sinasabi mong kutsilyo,' dagdag pa ng pangalawang officer. nakatitig ako sa dalawang pulis officer ng tahimik, hirap akong intindihin ang mga pangyayari lalo na't ang utak ko ay halos mawala na sa ulirat. 'ang mga sinabi mo ay nagpapatunay lamang sa mga natagpuaan namin sa cell phone ni michael villareal. nalaman namin na may roon siyang hacking apps,' pagpapatuloy ng senior officer. 'natagpuan din naman ang ilan mo pang mga hubong larawan at ang mga mensahe na iyong nabanggit. mayroon s'yang baril at nakita rin naman ang basyo ng bala nung binaril ka n'ya habang papatakas ka.' 'ang hindi namin maintindihan ay kung papaano s'ya namatay.' dagdag pa ng pangalawang officer, halatang hindi s'ya naniniwala sa aking reaksyon. 'ok lang kung napatay mo s'ya dahil sa self-defense, aya. may balak s'yang masama sa'yo.' 'hindi,' pautal-utal kong sagot. 'pangako, wala akong ideya... oh, oh my god.' naiyak na ako dahil sa mga nangyayari. 'ibig kong sabihin, nung nakaraang buwan lang may nag-report sa kanya galing sa isa n'yang co-worker,' sabi ni manlapig. 'jennah,' bulong ko. 'kilala mo si miss espiritu?' tanong ng pangalawang officer, at ng suspetya sa kanyang mga mats. 'hindi,' ako ang pumalit sa lamesa n'ya at nakuha ko ang notebook n'ya. dapat sinabi ko na 'to kanina pa. anong sabi sa report? doon nga ay nagtitigan ang dalawang pulis at maka-lipas ang ilang sandali ay inilatag at ipinaliwanag ni manlapig ang mga hindi magandang nangyari kay jennah na halos mangyari na sa akin. si jennah espiritu ay dumiretcho sa pinaka-malapit na hospital mula sa kanyang unang night shift tatlong buwan na ang nakakaraan. sobrang bugbog ng katawan n'ya at sugatan, at gustong mag-file ng anonymous rape kit. ang natanong damage n'ya sa kanyang puwerta ay sobrang severe na kinailangan n'yang sumailalim sa operasyon at magpatahi. nag-file s'ya ng police report makalipas ang dalawang buwan matapos s'yang hindi pumasa sa probationary period sa inyong kumpanya, ng nawala s'ya sa trabaho (ang nagiisang paraan para mabayaran ang kanyang utang sa hospital). ang nangyari ay ang kanyang aligasyon kontra kay michael villareal, na gumastos s'ya ng malaki sama mo pa ang hindi mabilang na kanyang mga co-workers na kumontra sa kanya laban sa magalang at kaaya-ayang katangian ni michael. 'pero kahapon lang ay iniurong na n'ya lahat ng mga isinampa n'yang kaso kay michael,' sabi ng walang badge na pulis. 'kasalukuyan naming inaalam ang kinaroroonan ni espiritu para ma-interview namin s'ya. sigurado ako na ngayon malinaw na kung bakit may suspetya kami sa iyo bilang nakikilala mo espiritu.' nagpatuloy ang mga tanong ng dalawang pulis hanggang may isang lalaki na nag-abot sa kanya ng isang sobre. natukoy na ng forensics ang fingerprint na nakita sa kutsilyo at ang blood-spatter patterns. kinailangan ko ring mag-submit ng dna samples para maka-tulong sa imbestigasyon at sa wakas ay pina-uwi na nila ako. sa bahay, dahil sa sobrang pagod, hindi ako maka-tulog. wala akong gamit na naiuwi. bag, cell phone at kahit ang jacket ko ay kinailangan i-submit bilang ebidensya. kaya naman napilitan akong gamitin ang luma kong laptop, umaasa na malibang sa internet. ang browser ko ay naka-login pa rin sa linkedin account ko mula sa nakaraang login, at nirefreshed ko ang page bilang naka-sanayan. isang maliit na red icon ang lumitaw na mayroon akong bagong mensahe. jennah. nagre-reply na s'ya sa akin. don't worry, sis. i took care of it. ❤️",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/t77k69/tagalized_story/,5 03 2022
Moving out/running away from my emotionally abusive father who was away for 10 years,"tl;dr: emotionally abusive ofw father recently came home after 10 years and we had a huge fight which made me too uncomfortable too stay in this house. already planned to move out even before he came home but he might think i'm moving out because of him (tho it's also true). i don't know how to tell him that i'm moving out knowing his tendencies hello, i’m 23 years old and my father was an ofw for 10 years. i won't go into details sa history ng pagiging emotionally abusive/manipulative niya before and during the time na nasa abroad siya since that would be too long considering na mahaba din yung story. anyways, umuwi siya last month and since di sila okay ng mother ko, umalis na yung mother ko sa bahay so natira kami ng kuya ko. nung first two days ang bait niya so naisip ko parang ang judgemental ko na inisip ko mga masasamang bagay sa kanya dati but then i was immediately proved wrong. on the second night pumasok siya sa kwarto ko nang lasing at 1 am and patulog na ako since may work pa the next day. verbatimly sabi niya “lasing tatay mo” and then proceed to ask some questions, catching up ganun and at the same time ilang beses niya inuulit na na tabi daw kami matulog and despite me saying no multiple times, lumapit pa rin siya at tumabi. at first wala akong ginawa since tatabi lang naman but then sumiksik siya nang sumiksik and that’s when i got uncomfortable so tumayo ako at lumabas ng kwarto para sana uminom ng tubig pero sumunod siya sa baba so tumakbo ako pabalik ng kwarto and nilock yung pinto. he kept on knocking and calling for my name pero ang sagot ko lang ay “matulog ka na pa bukas na tayo mag usap pag di ka na lasing” but of course he kept on denying na lasing siya. eventually he said “sisirain ko ‘tong pinto mo” and started banging on the door loudly tapos may ginagawa pa siyang di ko alam sa doorknob so i started shouting saying na ipapabarangay ko siya pag di siya tumigil but he didn’t stop and confidently said “oh sige” until he finally opened the door without a key. that alone was scary plus may expression pa sa mukha niya na di ko maexplain basta nakakatakot so tumakbo ako malapit sa kwarto ng kuya ko just in case na may gawin siya. sumunod siya then he started his manipulative sad boi session saying na 10 years siya nagsakripisyo para samin tapos ganun lang turing ko sa kanya, how he always wanted to go to college dati pero hindi kaya ng parents niya so nag ofw siya para hindi namin maexperience yun. hindi daw siya nanunumbat but kept on saying na hindi ako makakapag aral sa ganitong school kung di dahil sa kanya which is factually wrong since yung nanay ko yung nababaon sa utang para lang makabayad sa tuition namin dahil bihira siya magpadala. sinisigawan niya ko the whole time habang dinuduro duro ako. nakipag sigawan din ako asking questioning his actions that night then i made mention of the other traumatizing things he did and how he never realized that he's wrong but he kept on mentioning the 10 years/gusto niya magcollege. i ended it by saying na hindi ko naman ginusto mabuhay bakit siya nag anak tapos isusumbat niya lang lahat. days after that he started acting nice again cooking my favorite foods, other acts of service, etc but there was no apology, he’s acting like nothing happened and that we’re ok. i mean gets naman na ganun yung karamihan ng parents but the experience was not the same for me. until now i’m still anxious whenever we’re in the same room so i’m trying my best para umiwas magtatanong nga lang kung kumain na ako kumakabog na dibdib ko. di siya kumakatok sa pinto bago pumasok so iniiwan ko nalang na bukas para marinig ko and maready ko sarili ko pag papasok siya. and lastly tuwing iinom siya (around 3 times a week) kailangan ko i-barricade yung pinto sa takot. basta this home is no longer a safe place for me and gusto ko na lumipat plus kami rin naman ng kuya ko yung nagbabayad sa lahat ng gastusin. may nakita na akong lilipatan na malapit dun sa area kung saan nagsstay nanay ko tho dito pa rin sa barangay yung place. pinapalipat na ko next week and i don't know kung pano ako magpapaalam without any drama knowing na may sadboi tendencies nga yung tatay ko. tbh plan ko na talaga lumipat ng bahay by the end of the year bago pa umuwi yung tatay ko, baka kasi isipin niya na lilipat ako ng bahay dahil sa kanya tho it's true, hindi naman yun yung sole reason. i don't know what reactions i will get since the last time na nagpost ako dito about him natawag akong ""entitled brat"" for not appreciating his sacrifice despite showing evidence of him being an asshole but i just wanted to share my experience and maybe get some advice on how to tell him that i'm moving out",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/r6d7on/moving_outrunning_away_from_my_emotionally/,1 12 2021
From Pulpolitiko Facebook page,"“wala kasi akong alam sa batas” nakulong ang tatay ko at ang kapitbahay namin sa laspinas. nagsimula po ito sa baranggay almanza dos, kaninang 8:30am pumunta ang tatay ko na si michael sa baranggay almanza dos, nagtatanong sya ng update tungkol sa relief goods dahil hanggang ngayon po ay wala pa kaming natatanggap. mga ilang minuto lang, dumating ang kapitbahay namin na si kuya tonyo, para po magtanong din, pero hndi po sila magkasama, magkapitbhay lang sila. nag video po si kuya tonyo ng mga relief goods na nakatambak lamang sa baranggay. nagalit ang mga tao doon, at sinabing bawal daw un. nagtaka nalang ang tatay ko na si michael, dahil nagkagulo na ang mga tao sa likod nya, nakita nya doon si kuya tonyo na kinokompronta ng mga tao sa baranggay dahil video. sabi nalang ni kuya tonyo, ipadelete kay kapitan ang video. dahil wala naman syang masamang pakay doon, gusto lang nya ipakita sa mga tao dito sa amin na may relief goods na doon. napansin ng baranggay na may suot si kuya tonyo na tulfo action shirt na bigay lamang ng kanyang amo. hinanapan sya ng id na kasama sya sa tulfo action, at out of nowhere sinabi nyang nasa bahay. inaamin namin na mali si kuya tonyo doon. mali sya sa sinabi nya, na hndi namin alam kung dahil sa takot o para lamang manindak, hindi namin alam. pagkatapos noon. doon na sila nagalit. at si sinabihang pusasan si kuya tonyo. ang tatay ko na si michael , hindi nila pinusasan. pagkatapos nito lumapit na ang tatay ko na si papa michael kay kapitan. at nagpaalam na uuwi na dahil kailangan nya ipaalam sa pamilya ni kuya tonyo ang nangyari. pumayag na si kap sa pag uwi ng tatay ko. biglang sumabat ung naglilista ng mga pangalan na magkaparehas sila ng address sa quarantine pass. at sinabi kay kap na magkasama ang dalawa khit hindi naman. magkapitbahay silang dalawa pero walang kinalaman ang tatay ko sa ginawa ni kuya tonyo. sinabi ng tatay ko na hindi sila magkasama at nagkataon lang na nagkita sila sa baranggay. hindi sila naniniwala kahit na pati si kuya tonyo ay nagsalitang hindi sila magkasama. pagkatapos nito, sabi ni kap, iposas na silang dalwa sa iisang posas kahit meron social distancing na naka ordinansa ngayon. nag salita ang tatay ko na hindi sya kasama bakit sya ipoposas. habang naka posas sila, napansin ng tatay ko na may nag vivideo sa knyang taga baranggay. vinevideohan sya habang nakaupo at naka posas. isa ito sa mga kinagalit ng tatay ko dahil ang sabi nila bawal magvideo, bakit nila ito ginagawa? pumasok ang lalaking taga baranggay at sinumbong kay kapitana na nagagalit si papa sa knya. mukhang preso ang tatay ko doon kahit wala namang kasalanan. wala syang ginagawa sa inyo. dinala na sila sa precinto sa otso, sa daang hari evia. balik nanaman sa baranggay. nagtatanong sila kung sinong arresting officer, walang masagot ang mga taga baranggay at nag tuturuan pa kung sino sa kanila ang arresting officer. otw sa cityhall, kinuha ang mga gamit nila na importante dahil baka nakawin ng mga preso sa cityhall. doon naramdaman na ng tatay ko na tuloy tuloy na ito sa kulungan kahit wala naman silang kasalanan. pinapunta na sila sa city hall at kinulong. maya maya ay lumapit ang taga baranggay kay kuya tonyo at sinabing tanggalin ang password ng cellphone nya. nandoon ang video ng relief goods. may batas po ba dito na nakalabag sa privacy ni kuya tonyo? pag pasok ng tatay ko sa kulungan, ang tanging word para idescribe ang mga tao doon sabi nya sakin “para syang nasa babuyan”. alam nya sa sarili nyang hindi sya dapat nandoon dahil wala syang kasalanan. grabe ang galit ko bilang anak. habang nakikinig sa kwento ng tatay ko. nabugbog ang tatay ko sa loob. sinipa sa sikmura at ngayong 8pm kitang kita ko ang pasa sa knyang tyan. isa sa mga preso ay pinapaligo sya, hindi sya pumayag maligo, at sinipa sya bigla sa tyan. walang palag ang tatay ko. wlang kasalanan nilang pinasok sa kulungan. maya maya after almost 1 hr tinawag na si papa, pinapalabas na. ang sabi nila “pasalamat ka malakas ka sa kababayan mo.” hindi maipaliwanag ni papa kung matutuwa sya. o magagalit. dahil wala naman syang dapat ipagpasalamat dahil wala syang kasalanan. nag signal si kap na pakawalan na daw si kuya tonyo dahil madaming nakiusap na taga dito samin around 8pm. alam nyo ba? kasama si kap sa pagpapa distribute ng relief goods kasi nga naman march 30 na. anong petsa na po? kelan po yan pina distribute ng city hall sa inyo? ngayon hindi namin alam ano na ang nangyari kay kuya tonyo doon. kung nabugbog sya doon? hindi namin alam. hindi namin alam dahil umpisang rason lang ng pagpunta nila sa baranggay ay para sa relief goods na hanggang ngayong march 30 ay hindi pa kami nabbgyan. dilat na ang mata ng mga kapitbahay namin sa gutom. kaya sila na ang pumunta sa baranggay para makita ito. vinedeohan ang relief goods? pra saan? para mapabalita sa mga kapitbahay namin na meron na palang pagkain. ngayon, march 30, 2020 11:31pm tatay ko palang ang andito at nakatulala sa mga pangyayari. masakit bilang anak makita ang tatay mong tulala dahil wala syang alam na katwiran. at akong anak na kaya syang ipaglaban, dahil pinag aral nya ako, hindi ko sya hahayaan na magtaka habang buhay anong kasalanan nya. around 7pm dumating ang mga relief goods dito sa amin. kita namin na masaya ang mga kapitbahay namin. pero akong anak ng tatay kong nabugbog dahil nang hihingi sa baranggay nyo ng makakain, hindi ako natutuwa. nakakasuka. nakaka galit. ngayon malaya na si papa. yun na ba yon? nakakatawa kayo. sorry. kung tatanggapin namin ung relief goods na andito. kasi amin yan eh. pondo yan ng bayan. march 30 na kelan ang lock down? nakaka awa. nakaka awa ang tatay ko habang ineexplain ko sa knya kanina ung mga batas na nilabag ng baranggay at ng mga pulis na nagkulong sa knya. pinaliwanag ko kung anong krapatan nya. at ramdam ko sa knya yung pagod sa buong araw na pinaikot ikot sila. sabi lang nya sakin pagkatapos ko magsalita ng mga maling gnawa nila sa knya, “wala kasi akong alam sa batas nak.” at si kuya tonyo?

sincerely from me.* so i'm posting this update para sa mga redditors na nag follow kay nala especially sa mga nag donate. **may 22:** around 2 days after i posted a cry for help sa r/philippines nala isn't getting any better, kumakain pa din may gana pero hindi na ganun kalakas kagaya dati. but thursday night hindi siya kumain which is hindi naman nakakabahala, unfortunately morning to tanghali ayaw niya pa rin kumain so i tried carrying her and kinakausap ko siya but she's not responding. nabahala ako so tinry ko siya itayo para maglakad lakad pero bumabagsak lang siya ulit, nagpanic na ako so i called his original vet if he could help. i know it's a reach kasi ecq pa pero makakapunta daw siya hintayin ko daw siya sa bahay. when he arrived he told me to rush nala sa clinic nila (his original vet clinic) so nalaman ko nagbukas na pala sila around 2nd week of may. sinugod namin si nala sa furry friends sa caloocan and luckily siya lang ang patient non. they told me na grabe na yung damage sa skin niya and saw na baka may maggots yung paws na niya. they also told me that amputation is possible kapag unrepairable na or nabubulok na sugat niya especially sa paws at sa tail. masyado dinb daw manipis balat ni nala and napakadaming flakes na nagfafall off from her body kaya siya nangangati. &#x200b; [at furry friends clinic](https://preview.redd.it/saqrwsbx70251.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9443944503ec0cdd2041bd25de98691f5de3085b) i decided to skin scrape and cbc her. never pa siya na cbc, so ayun ang goal ko kasi hindi ko alam bakit hindi pa siya gumagaling since march. sa skin scrape nakita na meron siyang demodex (hindi ko po alam spelling) pero its an insect that causes itchyness and galis. she's positive for mange. the problem is usually marami na daw yung 1 to 2 na insect sa isang skin scrape pero sa kanya 12 (take note na hindi pa yun sa sugat kumuha) which indicates na sobrang abnormal na ng dami nung parasites. &#x200b; [shivers and cleaning ng sugat niya](https://preview.redd.it/eewwtclz70251.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=47d84285281125ed50cf12986e72905fba1b77b2) they told me this is caused by stress. dapat daw na cocontrol ng immune system niya yung pagdami nun kaso dahil na stress siya most probably because of the grooming kasi dun nagsimula siya mangati, sobrang dumami yung demodex. they even showed me what's on the microscope. nakakalungkot isipin na dahil lang sa simpleng grooming nagkaganyan na yung dating healthy na siya. cbc came out and they saw an abnormality sa mga components. may bacterial infection siya kaya bumababa ata ang hemoglobin niya hindi ko gaanong sure. while we were discussing, nala started to shiver and the doctor said na kinokombulsyon siya kasi 40 degrees yung temperature niya. &#x200b; [sorry nabura na yung cbc na naka attach, i also lost the computation how much it costs but naka php 3200 ako, she has around 6 na iniintake and a spray, plus the three injections.](https://preview.redd.it/z82q4n1380251.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9adfcdb1977fff2d30706a925e9023975745cb67) &#x200b; https://preview.redd.it/50ji08fa80251.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bea67e1d3f2a8d1a55a0fcf680fe2d1c326b73b0 they cleaned her sugat. and injected her three times. yung dalawa anti mange/anti parasite and yung isa for her fever. they told me na this will be a 6 week long na gamutan and babalik kami dun every friday starting 22. i agreed. they also told me to stop seeking for convenia because it'll be too costly and hindi sure na gagana, at least eto daw proven, they told me to make nala sa comfortable as possible to reduce her stress. bumalik na kami last friday and the doctors said na shes getting better albeit she lost .4 kg. pinalitan na din namin diet niya to reflex pero hindi niya gaanong kinakain. she's still weak, barely walking but nakakalakad na at least. the first 3 days din from 22 kamot siya ng kamot as in walang tigil kaya nakaka stress pero since monday she stopped itching na. nagtatanggalan na langib niya din. &#x200b; [her favorite spot on my chair](https://preview.redd.it/evaj95l190251.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=575df5eb0c79a5f0e8595cdfc248329bbbb63014) &#x200b; &#x200b; [latest pic, hindi na reddish skin niya and nagtatanggalan na scabs niya.](https://preview.redd.it/lpfmo7t390251.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4cbf0b6cdff492d9a6045c04268ec1345d1f9533) i**'m here to post this update to thank you guys for the support.** masakit man, pero kelangan ko kayo because some of my family members think na sayang lang ang pera sa kanya at ipamigay na lang daw namin tapos bumili na lang kami ng aso. i had arguments with my family because of this. maraming salamat po, she's recovering slowly pero hindi namin siya titigilan hanggang sa hindi siya gumagaling! **donations are still welcome, sobrang maappreciate namin yung donation because i barely have anything left.** 6 weeks na gamutan pa siya and every week may injection sa kanya. i hope na you guys are still willing to donate to an anonymous stranger and his dog. *if you are willing to donate please drop me a dm. pwede na din po bank kasi nakausap ko na gf ko and she lent me her bank account for donations.* ***please dm me for account # or gcash.*** &#x200b; thank you so much!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/gtqe7f/update_on_nala_my_maltichon/,31 05 2020
[NEED MEDICAL/LEGAL ADVICE] Doctor refused to sign my medical documents,"hi everyone! i don't know where else to ask this. or if this is a valid case to get a lawyer? can someone please enlighten me... 🙏 january 5 kasi, nagpasugod ako sa er ng isang private hospital dahil nag diarrhea ako with blood, and laging masakit tyan and joints ko then na admit ako from january 6-12. i have 3 different doctors. wala po akong pinili sakanila, sila lang ang nirefer ng health card ko sakin. and sa pagkatagal tagal kong nagstay dun, napagdecide nila na for ct scan ako. it happened january 11. yung 2 doctors, after lumabas ng results ng ct scan kinausap ako. (surgeon and rheumatologist) they agreed na bumuti na yung condition ko during my week-long stay. and base sa results ng ct scan, okay naman. no need for surgery, continue the medication nalang. pumayag na sila madischarge ako and mag followup nalang. so nagpa discharge na ko. however, nung kukuha na ko ng mga medical documents and fit to work, yung 1 doctor (gastro specialist) which is my main physician pa, gusto pa ng isang test dahil parang may nakikita daw syang bato sa gallbladder. i should do mrcp/ercp test pa daw. in her own firm words, ""never"" nya kong bibigyan ng fit to work and sign my medical documents. dahil need ko daw po muna gawin yung test na nirerequire nya, and for possible surgery daw po yung case ko. which is nag refuse na ko dahil... (1) inubos na nila laman ng health card ko (2) wala na rin akong cash pang test (3) i'm feeling better now (4) i think i have the ""right"" to decline because its my body? (5) no one even bothered to tell me how ct scan is done. i asked multiple nurses and parang ultrasound lang daw, ""uncomfy"" lang daw. claustrophobic po ako, at sobrang nginig at takot ko nung nandun na ko feeling ko mahihimatay na ko sa kaba. then i asked how is mrcp/ercp done, same as ct scan lang daw. 🙃 (6) i'm ready to die-- in fact, i'd rather die than do the test again. i asked her what are my other options. do the test lang daw. she wouldn't give me a fit to work dahil hindi nya daw po iririsk yung medical license nya giving ftw to someone na hindi naman talaga fit to work 🥴 kahit pumirma pa daw ako ng waiver. im not sure but i think mrsp cost around 20k+, kasi yung ct scan sakin is 25k already. i told her wala po talaga akong pera pang test, her answer is ""its not my problem anymore"". i asked help from my 2 other doctors at baka sila na pwede mag sign, no. si doc gastro daw kasi main physician ko so sakanya daw talaga dapat. help, i respect naman po her decisions pero tama po ba na kahit ayaw na ng patient, kahil alam na ng patient yung risk and ayaw talagang ituloy, need po ba talaga sumunod sa gusto ni doc magpatest and possible surgery? hindi po ako makabalik sa work ko kasi need yung documents. tinry na kausapin ng company doctor namin si gastro specialist, and same lang din sinasabi. i dont know much about medical and legal field. so i'd appreciate any help. asking for legal advice kasi baka this is something na pwede ilaban lol. kung hindi, edi wag. wag na tayo pastress. =========== tldr; kelangan ko ng signed medical documents para makabalik sa work, pero ayaw i-sign ng main doctor ko kasi hindi ko nasunod yung gusto nya na magpa-test pa. 💸 =========== thanks in advance. p.s. sabi ni doc bawal ako mastress at mapagod, pero bakit naman ganito sya mismo nagpapastress at papagod sakin magpabalik balik ng hospital 😵 & andami pa po nila kabalastugan for the whole duration of my stay (ex. they asked me to fast 48hrs for ct scan, yes 48) pero sobrang haba na para ichika ko pa lahat dito. gusto ko lang naman po bumalik na sa work...",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/kzvmoj/need_medicallegal_advice_doctor_refused_to_sign/,18 01 2021

Ang hirap ng buhay sa Pilipinas.

Why I dont like (most) doctors,"i have bad experiences with doctors eversince i was a child. dont get me wrong, i have friends who are doctors, who are sincerely kind and nice, and true to their oath. but most that i have encountered are... rude, unapologetic, and arrogant. i know most of them save lives... but i dont think it gives them the right to act like they are gods. for me, i just treat them as professionals especially when i am paying them. well... i think thats the only way to treat doctors, as such. if i pay them, they shouldnt be rude and aholes. thats why i change doctors when i encounter as such. but when you are in a hospital and theres no choice but to accept whoever comes along, because its a matter of life and death, theres no choice but to accept an ahole doctor at the moment. i remember when my friend got beaten up and raped...and, because her face was swollen like a ballon from the beatings, the doctors at the er joked if she took too much steroids after we told them what happened. i remember when i was a student, and a doctor berated me for having tattoos and smoking. i remember when my mom was hospitalized, the nurse told me the specialist was too busy to answer our questions. i remember... well, a lot of bad experiences concerning doctors. i remember when we were pleading to a surgeon for more discount, na pwede ba 100k na lang ang fee nya dahil walang wala na kami, dahil more than 700k na ang hospital bill. sabi nya magbayad na lang kami ng direkta sa kanya, para 200k na lang ang fee so that wala ng extra 40-50k tax... at kung gusto namin ng resibo para sa anumang dahilan, magbayad kami ng p100 sa hospital (siguro kunwari yung p100 ang fee nya, at under the table and 200k). magpasalamat na lang daw kami na may discount kami sa tax, at siguro para makalabas na kami ng ospital. dyusko, talagang kung kani kanino kami lumapit para makahagilap at mamalimos ng pera, para hindi na madagdagan ang gastos namin sa ward ( kahit libre kasi ang ward, may gastusin pa rin kasi, para sa oxygen etc na umaabot ng 10 to 20k sa isang araw, liban pa sa gamot na kami ang bumibili). i always think ""paano pa kaya ang mas nangangailangan pa kesa sakin, sa mga ward, na naghihintay ng grasya at awa sa dyos .."" i have interviewed old doctors who became successful, they were nice... sabi nga ng isa minsan daw manok at prutas ang nakukuha nila. yung iba, ganun din daw. naisip ko, ang bait nila, at yumaman din sila (nabiyayaan). sabi nila, of course need ng pera, pero pag may naghihikahos sa pera, at buhay ang nakasalalay, mabigat daw sa kunsensya na gagatasan mo pa... yung iba nga, kung magkano lang daw ang kaya. yung iba libre (but im not really expecting this, since ang alam ko, nililibre lang ang doctors fee pag kakilala or vip na may kapalit na favor or maawain at mayaman ang doctor). kahit sa pagsagip ng buhay, di ba, uso pa rin ang connections. tulad ng surgeon na ayaw ng 100k, bahala na raw kami maghanap ng 200k since na-discountan kami sa tax. naisip ko, sana man lang pwede ng five gives o ano ang 200k, under the table naman kasi, di ba. pero kelangan daw diretcho at saktong 200k para makalabas kami ng ospital. kasi di kami ""connected"". maybe... a little compassion and understanding would help alleviate the hardhsips in life. then again, that tax discount is, after all, that little compassion and understanding... i just have to be thankful kesa wala, di ba. nakakalungkut lang. but i guess thats life... esp sa pilipinas na mahirap talaga ang maging mahirap (o kinakapos sa pera). sana naman wag magalit ang mga doctor na makakabasa nito. alam ko naman na lagi kayong puyat at pagod. ang sakin lang siguro, kami na nagbabayad sa inyo, pag naubos ang pera sa fees ninyo, wala kaming pahinga at umiiyak na lang. sa mga espesyalista, kaming maralita e di kayang mag paris o san man. dyan lang kami sa karinderya o tambay sa mall para magpa aircon. lahat naman tayo napapagod...at lahat tayo pag nasugatan, tao lang. wala pong dyos satin sa lupa. kaya sana maging mabait kayo at maging magalang sa pasyente kahit mahirap. again, hindi ko nilalahat... para sakin, karamihan lang e pangit ang asal. and to those who are compassionate, nice, and understanding, i salute you and wish you all the blessings in life. peace to all. [edit] much thanks to those who understood and empathized with my plight, and im sorry na nakaranas din kayo ng bad doctors. again, doctors are good for the community, any community as they save lives. but those who are aholes should just quit to stop giving those few sincere doctors a bad rep.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/14n2jt3/why_i_dont_like_most_doctors/,30 06 2023

"Alam niyo ba na registered na BARIL NG SUNDALO ang pumatay kay Ninoy, ayon sa imbestigasyon?","welcome to #aug21files. every day, one archival info. hindi ang smith & wesson .357 magnum revolver ang ginamit upang paslangin si benigno s. aquino, jr. noong agosto 21, 1983. noong una pa lang, bagama’t ito ang tinuturong murder weapon ng philippine constabulary criminal investigation service (sa ilalim ni col. hermogenes peralta, jr.), hindi na naniniwala ang mga tao na ito ang baril na pinutok upang patayin si ninoy. sa ulat ng pc-cis, positibo sa paraffin test si rolando galman. ibig sabihin, pumutok ito ng baril sa loob ng dalawang araw bago siya pinatay noong agosto 21. pero kung siya ang tunay na salarin, at ang .357 magnum revolver ang kanyang ginamit (alinsunod sa bersyon ng militar), bakit iba ang epekto ng pagbaril sa bangkay ni ninoy? sabi ng the toronto star, “\[t\]he used bullet from galman’s .357 magnum handgun produces a large wound — not the small exit point on aquino’s chin.” sabi naman ni detective kunimoto sa isang dokumentaryong unang ipinalabas sa japan (at ipinaikot bilang betamax tape sa pilipinas): “if the bullet hole \[in\] the entry wound is eight to nine millimeters in diameter \[…\] then we would expect that half of \[ninoy’s\] fade would have been blown off.” ayon sa opisyal na autopsy report kay ninoy na inilabas ng national bureau of investigation, 7.0 hanggang 8.0 centimeters lang ang lawak ng exit wound sa may baba ni ninoy. sabi nga mismo ni mario bautista, isa sa mga abogadong nakahanay sa defense noong nililitis ng sandiganbayan ang aquino-galman double-murder case, “nahawakan ko ‘yung baril. naalala ko, ang impression ko no’n was mabigat yung baril. it was a .357 magnum revolver, which is an extremely powerful handgun.” kung hindi lohikal bilang murder weapon ang .357 magnum revolver na ito, ano ang tunay na handgun? sabi ni kunimoto: “automatic nine-millimeter pistol.” ito ang baril na ginagamit ng kapulisan sa pilipinas. “no lead is exposed and when it hits a human body it penetrates well. and one of its features in comparison with the .357 is that the wound at the point of the exit is usually small.” binasag din ng ulat ng agrava fact-finding board ang teorya ng militar na ang .357 handgun ang murder weapon. ayon sa board counsel’s report, “there is simply no proof to support that theory.” dagdag pa nito, malinaw na ang “chemical contents” ng bala ng .357 revolver na nasa exhibit 88 ng kanilang ebidensya ay hindi tumutugma sa fragments na lumitaw sa bangkay ni ninoy sa exhibit 438-t-1. ganito rin ang naging konklusyon ng sandiganbayan noong 1990. ani nito, .38 o .45 caliber na pistol ang ginamit upang patayin si ninoy. ito rin ang nagsisilbing service firearm ng mga pulis at sundalo noong panahon ng diktadurang marcos. mahalaga ang anggulo na ito dahil isa ito sa mga magpapatunay kung totoo ba ang opisyal na bersyon ng mga sundalo o hindi. kung .357 magnum revolver nga ang lumabas na tunay na murder weapon sa pagpatay kay ninoy, mapapatunayang si galman talaga ang tunay na gunman. ngunit sa pagsisiyasat ng mga imbestigador, korte, at midya gamit ang mga ebidensya mula sa agosto 21, malinaw na hindi ito ang baril na ginamit. pinatutunayan nito na hindi si galman ang totoong bumaril kay sen. aquino. ayon sa mga tanong na inilabas ng mr & ms special edition sa second status report ni brig. gen. prospero olivas, dalawa sa mga escorts ni ninoy—sina sgt. arnulfo de mesa at constable first class rogelio moreno—ang natukoy ng dalawang japanese television analysts na may dalang baril sa loob ng saradong holsters nila, taliwas sa kwento ng militar na walang bitbit na baril ang sinuman sa limang escorts na sumundo kay ninoy mula sa eroplano. ang tanong: sino ang pumutok sa gatilyo? \#fromthearchives \#defendhistoricaltruth &#x200b; https://preview.redd.it/7rfgx5rkyug91.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=613fbe24cc8fb98e4f7c035282c64896ee6956c7",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/wktbs9/alam_niyo_ba_na_registered_na_baril_ng_sundalo/,10 08 2022
[M]Y EXPERIENCE IN TUGUEGARAO CITY FLOODING. (Long post),"hello everyone! i'm from linao (east), tuguegarao city, yung sobrang lubog sa baha na barangay na trending sa buong social media. first and foremost, we[together with my fam & relatives] are safe from the flood(thanks god!). we are here at zone 2 of the barangay and yung totally flooded (lagpas bahay) is nasa zone 6 or 7, not quite sure. humuhupa na po ang baha at sana magtuloy-tuloy na. looking back at 11pm of nov. 13, 3 steps nalang po ng hagdan bago maabot ang 2nd floor ng bahay to think na elevated pa itong bahay so how much more na sa mga mabababang bahay, totally submerged na sila sa tubig baha. hindi makapasok ang mga rescuers dahil hindi kasya ang mga motorized rubber boats sa mga eskinita ng mga natrap na tao. idagdag mo ring zero visibility kasi napaka dilim dahil brownout sa buong lugar. iniisip na naming lumikas pero ang aking nanay at mga(3) tita ay kalmado lamang, nakahigang nasa likod ng ulo ang mga kamay at sabing ""sanay kami maligo sa dagat. huwag niyo kaming alalahanin, hindi kami aalis dito sa bahay"". sobrang nakakatakot sa labas kasi napakalakas ng agos ng baha, isang maling tapak at na-outbalance ka, siguradong buhay mo kaagad ang kapalit. we stayed in our house. i prayed nalang talaga na bumaba ang baha at pagsapit ng 2:37am ng nov.14, chineck ko yung pencil marks na ginawa ko ng 11pm sa dingding namin, bumaba pero almost 1 inch lang. (sobrang saya ko na dito kasi king ina at least bumaba na). tumuntong ako sa bubong ng sala namin na nasa bukana lang ng aming bintana, huminga ng malalim at napatulala sa mga bituin. sobrang dilim at tahimik ng paligid, ang tanging naririnig ko lamang ay mga tunog ng palaka. maya-maya, parang may mga naririnig akong mga boses ng tao at finocus ko ang pandinig sa mga iyon disregarding ang mga palaka, and wtf, ang naririnig ko na sinasabi ng mga tao ay ""rescue"" at ""tulong"" echoing all over our barangay in all directions. sobrang hina lamang ng naririnig ko dahil sa kalayuan ng mga taong sumisigaw. (kung napakinggan niyo yung 17sec clip ng mga tao sa social media na sumisigaw ng ""rescue"", yes that's all true. pero imagine hearing it personally from 3am to 4:30am, wala na talaga akong magagawa kundi ipagdasal na sana maabot na ng rescuers ang aking mga ka-barangay.) ako'y napraning at chineck ulit ang tubig ng 4:30am, bumaba pa ito ng 1 inch. i was so happy na sa span ng 5 hrs, bumaba ang tubig ng 2 inches. yes. 2. freaking. inches. my goodness! as of now, patuloy nang humuhupa ang baha. mababaw na ang tubig, hanggang dibdib na lamang sa labas ng bahay. i mean, may kalaliman parin pero kumpara nung peak ng baha, lagpas pa siguro kahit iangat ko ang aking kamay. approx 6-7ft (i'm 5'7 btw, alam ko to kasi bumili ako ng pagkain namin para dito sa bahay, hanggang leeg tas naka tip-toe ako sa tubig). note na sa zone 2 lamang po ito, sa ibang zones baka umabot ng 15-20ft. i'm writing this at 9pm of november 14, 2020(will probably post it late bc of signal issues), naghihintay ng mga ipamimigay na tubig-inumin dahil trapped parin po kami sa baha. gustuhin ko mang maging bridge of all donations for us here sa flooded area pero trapped parin po kami sa baha at kami rin po mismo ay nangangailangan ng tulong. i excluded all political aspects, didn't dig deep sa mga issues like ""nasaan si mayor"" issue, ""okay lang ang cagayan"" issue by governor, and kilala niyo na kung sinong tinutukoy kong gustong lumangoy. vp leni, u da real mvp being the 1st one to respond to our calls from the national politicians. (alam kong may kanya kanya tayong manok pero sana hindi tayo magbulag-bulagan) #2022 sobrang nakakatakot ang rumaragasang tubig ng baha, sana lagi po tayong mag-iingat. nakalimutan na po ng mga tao ang social distancing dahil hand in hand po kaming nakikipag-sapalaran at nakikipag-laban para sa buhay laban sa bahang ito. ito ang aking mga karanasan sa baha, pasensya kung may mali man kayong makita at mabasa. please pray for us. kapit lang. babangon ulit tayo. maraming salamat sa lahat ng tumulong, tumutulong at tutulong pa lalo na sa mga rescuers natin. this is the worst flood i've ever had. please be safe! #cagayanvalleyneedshelp #bangoncagayanvalley",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ju3w8l/my_experience_in_tuguegarao_city_flooding_long/,14 11 2020

My first encounter with our criminal justice system,"imporant note - i would change some details as to protect the identity of those involved. ngyari to about feb 2020, before yung covid hard lockdown. kakagaling ko lang sa tindahan at pasakay na sa kotse ko. may isang kotseng maliit na naka harang sa drive way. di ako maka alis or yung mga asa harap niya. di ko pinansin at sumakay na sa kotse ko. mamaya maya may mga taong pumunta doon sa kotse para kausapin siya dahil wala nga namang makadaan dahil naka harang siya. tumagal siguro ng 10 minutes yung usapan pero nag mamatigas yung driver nung maliit na kotse. medyo napipikon na din ako so bumaba na din ako sa sasakyan at lumapit. mamaya maya bumaba na yung tao doon sa maliti na kotse at sinuntok yung mga nakikiusap sa kanila. syempre gaganti yung nasuntok, pero naawat naman namin sila ng mga nanonood sa eksena. after a while dumating yung mga tanod and napaalis na yung nakaharang na kotse. umalis na rin ako dahil maliit na bagay lang naman yun. fast forward to about aug 2020. naka tangap ako ng tawag doon sa suki ko (kung saan ako bumili). store owner: c, naalala mo yung away last time nung bumili ka dito? me: oo, store owner: nagkademandahan sila, and tinatanong ako nung isang partido kung willing kang tumistigo. me: store owner, maliit na bagay lang yan hayaan mo na sila. malaking abala lang yan store owner: attempted homicide yung kaso, makukulong yung isang panig and right there, di ako mapakapaniwala na attempted homicide na pala yung nakita ko. natawa na lang din ako sa totoo lang. ewan ko din, pero for some reason. inalis ko yung sd card nung dash cam ko at pinalitan ng blanko. siguro as precaution dahil baka madamay ako. isa din kasi ako sa umawat. pero yun nga, di pa rin ako pumayag na tumestigo sa away nila dahil maliit lang naman yun. about october naka tangap ulit ako ng tawag mula sa store owner. dahil umakyat na daw yung kaso sa korte and pupuntahan niya daw ako para kausapin. kasama yung isang side. di ako pumayag. later that night tumawag sakin yung anak nung isang side umiiyak asking me na pakingan lang sila. so ayun pumayag na din ako. so ayon doon sa isinampang kaso nung humarang sa daan, attempted homicide daw ang ngyari dahil may kutsilyo daw yung kabilang partido at sinubukan siyang saksakin. yung mga evidence niya are: 1. medico legal - at doon sa medicolegal may mga hiwa nga siya ng kutsilyo. sa belly sa collar bone. pero light scratches lang lahat 2. eye witness - 5 sila at sinusuportahan nila yung kwento nung kotseng humarang 3. police report - sinusuportahan din nito yung kwento nung nagdemanda at ng tatlong witness 4. photos and mga hiwa at galos niya so noon nakita ko to, di ako makapaniwala sa totoo lang. dahil ganun lang pala kabilis mag fabricate ng isang krimen. at makukulong yung isang tao dahil may isang taong gagamitin yung batas para makapag higanti. pumayag din ako sa huli na maging witness. tatlo lang kaming witness nung inaakusahan. ako, yung store owner, at isang trike driver (4 kung sasali yung inaakusahan). pero ang pinaka mabigat naming evidence yung dash cam recording ko. ang tagal din nung hearing. and ako mismo 2 times ako sumalang sa korte. nakaka drain sa totoo lang, dahil ang tagal ng ngyari noon tapos paikot ikot yung tanong para bang iniintay ka nilang magkamali. syempre di na rin naman fresh from memory ito by febuary lumabas na yung decision ang yun nga acquited yung pinagbintangan. nag sampa din ng counter charge yung nademanda. perjury at malicious prosecution. again i agree na tumestigo, dahil natakot na din ako na ang bilis lang palang kalikutin ng justice system natin. yung dinedemanda at large pa din hangang ngayon. dahil nung lumabas na yung charges sa kanya nagtago na siya. &#x200b; about doon sa humarang sa daan. 25 years old lang siya. apparently isa doon sa witness is nag aaral ng law, at tinuruan siya kung ano ang gagawin. (wtf sa totoo lang!) yung nagturo sa kanya is wala pang prior experience sa legal system natin. kungbaga text book lang lahat. nag agree yung 4 out of 5 na tumestigo laban sa kaibigan nila in exchange na idrodrop ang charges laban sa kanila. yung 1 pa, hindi na rin mahagilap. so base doon sa kwento nung mga witness is, self inflicted nga yung mga galos niya. wtf sobra. and na buo lang nila tong plano nung nag iinuman sila. birobiroan lang daw sa totoo. ang plano nila sa totoo lang was tatakutin ng demanda yung kabilang panig. and once makipag settle hahatiin nila yung pera. hihingi daw sila ng 5m as settlement at paghahatian. ang hindi nila alam was lalaban din yung dinemanda nila. ang original plan lang pala was hangang prosecutor lang dapat. kaso yun nga umakyat daw yung demanda.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ofc3mn/my_first_encounter_with_our_criminal_justice/,7 07 2021

"alex, tanghaling tapat ng sabado, 2021","(any review for this is very-very much appreciated. i'm an aspiring writer po and i just launched a passion project anthology, isa po ito sa mga kwento) &#x200b; **chairman** ngayon ko lang naranasan ‘to sa tagal ko nang nanunungkulan sa barangay. isama mo na sa mga karanasang ‘yon ang lahat ng away mag-asawa, suntukan ng mga lasing, at mga batang ginagahasa sa bukiran. pero eto… ngayon ko lang napansin na buong araw ko na palang hinihimas ang rosaryong nakasabit sa leeg ko. maya’t-maya ko pa hinahalikan at binubulungan na sana’y wag mangyari sa pamilya ko ang nakita ko kanina. naririnig ko pa rin ang sigaw ni cecil, kumare’t-kapitbahay namin, tanghaling tapat ng sabado, kung saan ang tanghalian sa buong kalsada nami’y naantala dahil sa kanyang nakakakilabot na sigaw. sa ilalim ng nagbabagang init ay nagsitakbuhan kami upang sumaklolo. kinailangan ko pang iwanan ang tinola ni misis at ang isang basong softdrinks na nilalanguyan pa dalawang yelo nang ako’y tumakbo papunta sa bahay ni cecil. ngayo’y hindi pa rin ako kumakain. sa totoo nga’y hindi pa ako nakakaranas ng gutom. hindi ko pa ata kaya. sa bahay ni cecil ay dinatnan namin ang katawan ng panganay ni cecil na si joe na nakaratay sa braso ng kanyang bunsong kapatid na si alex, sa sahig ng kanilang sala. sa leeg ni joe ay nakabaon ang basag na bote na ginamit ni alex na balot na balot sa dugo ng kanyang kapatid. agad ang kapit at halik ko sa aking rosaryo nang makita ko ang imahe; na parang sinaunang obra na naglalahad ng malagim na kwento. pero ano ang kwento neto? hanggang ngayon ay wala pa rin kaming ideya kung bakit. magmula sa pagsigaw ni cecil ng, “anong nangyari?! anak, anong nangyari?!” sa tulalang alex na nakatitig sa dilat na mga mata ni joe, hanggang sa pagpunta namin dito sa aking opisina sa barangay, ay wala pa rin kaming makuhang rason mula sa bakit. sa isang maliit na kwarto sa aking opisina’y pinaupo ko muna si alex. tulala at sinusubukang burahin ang dugo sa kanyang mukha gamit ang duguan ring damit n’ya. hinainan ko ng isang bote ng softdrinks at tatlong pandesal mula pa sa agahan namin kanina si alex, na agad namang n’yang kinain ng walang pag-aalinlangan. dito na nagsimulang gumapang ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod. isang kilabot na hindi ko maipaliwanag, habang pinapanood ko si alex na walang awat sa pagkain, habang ako’y hindi ko pa rin magawang matakam sa masarap na lutong nag-aabang sa’kin sa bahay. “alex,” marahan kong sinabi. “ba’t mo ginawa ‘yun?” tumingin lamang sa’kin si alex, patay na mga mata, bibig na mabagal ang nguya. at sa kanyang paglunok ay walang mga salitang bumalik sa’kin. hindi ko alam kung bakit pero bigla kong naalala si jefferson, isang tricycle driver dito sa’min. dalawang taon na ang nakakalipas nang mapatay n’ya ang isang dayo na nakaaway n’ya sa kalsada. nangyari ‘to nang kamuntikan n’yang makasalpukan ang sasakyan ng dayo, at nang nahinto silang dalawa’y nagkasagutan muna sila bago mapikon si jefferson. hinampas n’ya ng bakal na tubo ang dayo. hindi na raw n’ya napigilan dahil sa mga mapanglait na mga salitang tinawag sa kanya. bobo, unggoy, uling, mababa. labing-isang beses paulit-ulit na hinampas ni jefferson sa ulo ang dayo, at sa sobrang lakas ng bawat hampas ay may parte na ng utak na lumabas dito. sa prisinto’y naalala ko si jefferson, iyak nang iyak at humihingi ng tawad dahil sa nangyari. hindi makakain, hindi rin makatulog. nilamon na s’ya ng konsensya n’ya, at ang konsensya n’ya ang tumulak sa kanya na agawin ang baril ng isa sa mga pulis na nagbabantay, at iputok sa kanyang sariling ulo. nasaktan si jefferson, nagalit, at di nakapagpigil. naintindihan ko ang kwento ‘nun. pero bakit hindi ko maintindihan ‘to? alam kong magkasundo ang magkapatid na ‘to. alam ko kung ga’no sila kalapit sa isa’t-isa. kaya pa’no nangyari ‘to? ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod ay gumagapang paakyat hanggang sa aking dibdib, tila ba kumakapit ng mahigpit. pasikip nang pasikip at medyo nahihirapan akong huminga. ang kakaibang pakiramdam na ‘to’y tumitindi habang nanatiling tahimik at nakatitig lamang sa’kin si alex. biglang iniabot ni alex ang kanyang kamay at dito tumalon na ang puso ko. napaatras ako sa aking kinauupuan, at mabilisan kong hinugot ang aking rosaryo mula sa pagkakatago nito sa aking damit. itinutok ko ito kay alex, na walang ibang kibo kun’di ang kunin ang bote ng softdrinks na nasa harapan n’ya. mas bumilis pa ang pagkatok sa aking dibdib, na para bang kamuntikan na kong mamatay. habang si alex nama’y pinapanood lang ako habang patuloy ang kanyang pag-inom. wala nga ata talagang mangyayari, at nang maramdaman ko kung gaano katahimik ang kwarto’y kumalma na ako. bakit sa dulo ng utak ko’y hinihiling ko na may sapi o di kaya’y isang demonyo talaga ang kaharap ko, at sa presensya ng aking rosaryo’y masasaktan s’ya. kahit anong kakaiba. kahit ano basta magkaroon lang ng eksplenasyon ang nangyari. pero siguro’y kakaiba na rin ang ikinikilos ng bata. at siguro nga’y mas dapat talaga akong matakot sa buhay kaysa sa patay. **cecil** “saan ba ko nagkulang?” tanong ni aling cecil sa mga kumare n’yang nakapalibot sa kanya sa masikip na opisina ni chairmain. napapaligiran din s’ya ng makukulay na mga pamaypay na hindi sabay-sabay ang pagaspas sa harap n’ya; nilulunod si aling cecil sa hangin. ang kanyang mukha nama’y tila ba isang rebulto ng santo kung punas-punasan ng mga panyo. “hindi ko pa rin maintindihan,” dugtong n’ya. “hindi naman ako nagkulang sa aruga. pareho ko namang pinapakita sa kanila na pantay ang pagmamahal ko sa kanila.” tuyo na ang mga mata ni aling cecil, ngunit tila ba hindi pa rin tapos ang kanyang pag-iyak. “hindi sila nag-aaway. hindi ko man lang narinig na nagtalo silang dalawa. o kung may pagtatalo man, malamang sa malamang maliit na bagay lang ‘yun. hindi yung ikakamatay mo!” isang labi ng lumapit sa tenga ni aling cecil, “alam mo tingin ko, baka inggit ‘yan. kasi si joe lang may trabaho sa kanilang dalawa, di ba? tapos si alex, wala pa rin sa kolehiyo. nag-aaral pa rin. sigurado akong ‘yun ang dahilan.” isa pang labi ang lumapit sa kabilang tenga naman ni aling cecil, “baka napikon na. kasi di ba halos s’ya na sa lahat ng gawaing bahay? baka pakiramdam n’ya porke’t mas malaki ambag ng kapatid n’ya , alila na s’ya neto.” isang labi naman na kaharap ni aling cecil ang nagsabing, “baka nagbabait-baitan lang kasi nga si joe ang halos sumasalo sa mga bayarin, pati sa pag-aaral n’ya. pero galit talaga s’ya, kasi baka naman may pagkakataong mas nabibigyang-atensyon si joe kahit hindi n’yo napapansin. kasi halimbawa uuwi s’yang pagod galing sa trabaho, syempre di n’yo maiwasang alagaan, pagsilbihan.” sa gitna ng mga labing ito’y si aling cecil, at ang ideyang unti-unting nabubuo dahil sa mga sinasabi ng mga labi sa kanya. “siguro,” sabi n’ya. “siguro nga.” **abbie** ang pangalan n’ya’y abbie. social worker daw s’ya. pagpasok n’ya’y agad bumungad sa’kin ang asul na bra sa ilalim ng dilaw na blouse nang tapatan ito ng liwanag mula sa bintanang katabi ko. sa kanyang pagtali ng buhok ay nakita kong basang-basa na ang kanyang kili-kili at kumikinang na sa pawis ang kanyang leeg. “alex?” sabi n’ya habang maya’t-mayang tinutulak ng kanyang daliri ang salamin n’yang dumudulas sa kanyang matangos na ilong. “bakit di mo ikwento muna sa’kin ang nangyari bago tayo umalis dito?” pasensya ka na, abbie. hindi ko nagawang sabihin kay chairman, na kilala pa mandin namin. hinding-hindi ko rin masasabi sa’yo. walang ibang maglalahad ng nangyari kun’di ang mga taong nais magbigay kahulugan dito, kasi kung ako tatanungin kung bakit, sa totoo lang, hindi ko rin alam ang isasagot. may nabasag akong bote sa kusina kanina, at sa pagpulot ko nito’y pumasok sa isip ko ang isang udyok. yung tipo ng udyok kapag nasa mataas kang lugar, at bigla mo na lang gustong itulak ang kasama mo. pero alam mong hindi ito dapat gawin, at kakapit ka pa nang mas mahigpit sa kanila para masiguro mong hindi ito mangyayari. ang udyok na ito’y nagsabi sa’kin na isaksak ko kay kuya ang basag na bote. at nalaman ko na lang na totoo na pala ang lahat nang dumapo sa aking balat ang mainit na dugo ni kuya. nahinto lang ako nang maramdaman ko ang buto sa leeg n’ya at nang marinig kong nabibilaukan na s’ya sa kanyang sariling dugo. hindi ko pa rin alam kung bakit. sana, tulad ng iniisip ni chairman, ay nasapian na nga lang ako. pero nakita ko ang lahat, andun ako. hindi ko lang alam na totoo pala ang lahat. namatay si kuya joe sa wala. at hindi ko matanggap na wala. normal lang sana ang sabado namin. tahimik. nanonood lang si kuya ng tv, naglilinis ako sa kusina. si nanay nama’y namamalengke ng pananghalian namin. bicol express daw ang lulutuin n’ya. puta, sinira ko ang araw. gusto kong umiyak dahil hindi na kami babalik sa salo-salo namin. “alex?” muling tawag ni abbie. “gusto kong malaman kung bakit. tayong dalawa lang. kaibigan mo ko dito. hinding-hindi ko ‘to sasabihin sa nanay mo, sa mga kapitbahay n’yo. may mga naririnig ako sa labas na dahil daw sa inggit? totoo ba ‘to? sa inggit nga? magmula nang dinala ako ni chairman dito sa maliit na kwartong ito’y napagpasyahan kong manahimik na lang sa nangyari. sa ngayo’y nilalabanan ko ang mga luha, nilalabanan ko ang panginginig ng aking bibig, at ang mga salitang gustong lumabas mula sa’kin. dapat mukhang hindi ko pinagsisisihan. dapat mukha akong galit. para naman mabigyang halaga, mabigyan ng ibig-sabihin ang pagkamatay ni kuya joe. dapat tinatatak ko sa utak ko na dapat lang! dapat lang sa kanya ang nangyari. dapat hindi ako bibigay. dahil kapag natalo ako, mamatay talaga sa wala si kuya. “sige, kung ayaw mong magkwento, ako muna. kasi naalala ko ‘tong isang batang babae at ang tatay n’yang abusado. tatay n’yang lasinggero. tatay n’yang isang beses s’yang hinipuan sa kanyang sariling kwarto at pinilit. ampon ang batang ‘yon, at tatay-tatayan n’ya lang etong umaabuso sa kanya. takot na takot ang bata dahil pakiramdam n’ya isang gabi’y papatayin na lang s’ya bigla neto. kaya naman isang gabi, nang bigla s’yang pinuntahan ng kanyang tatay upang pagsamantalahan ulit, sinasaksak ito ng bata gamit ang lapis sa mata, sa leeg, at sa dibdib.” kumuha ng panyo si abbie. sa kanyang paggalaw ay muling sumisilip ang kanyang bra sa likod ng blouse na parang mga batang naglalaro sa likod ng kurtina. “masarap sa pakiramdam, pero pumapatay pa rin s’ya ng tao. ilan taon n’yang dinibdib ‘yun. hanggang ngayon nararamdaman pa rin n’ya ang mga kamay ng tatay n’ya sa kanyang ari. sa kanyang dibdib. ilang taon bago n’ya matanggap ang ginawa n’ya. ngayon, medyo mahirap pa ring ikwento, pero kahit papaano’y kaya ko na. nangyari na kasi.” para bang may sumuntok sa aking dibdib nang marinig ko ‘to. bigla kong tinanggal ang aking paningin sa kanyang bra, at sa paggalaw ng aking mga mata’y bigla kong naramdaman ang pamumuo ng mga luha. “ayos lang, alex. pero andito lang ako. aalagaan ka muna namin. tapos pag handa ka na, makikinig ako. kahit pakonte-konte pa, ayos lang. aantayin kong mabuo ang kwento mo.” bumibilis bigla ang tibok ng puso ko. lalong nanginginig ang aking labi. at biglang pumasok si kuya sa isip ko, tumatakbo papalayo sa akin. mga bata pa kami, at hinahabol ko s’ya. “alex?” kuya wag kang lumayo! “alex?” kuya dito ka lang! kailangan kita dito! “sige, ayusin na natin pag-alis mo.” at parang isang batang nadapa sa semento, dito na walang awat na tumulo ang luha sa aking mga mata. “alex?” “hindi ko rin alam… hindi… ko rin alam. sorry, kuya! sorry! hindi ko rin alam kung bakit! patayin n’yo na lang ako! hindi ko alam anong nangyari! hindi ko na kaya!” lumalabo na ang aking paningin, pero kahit ga’no kalabo ang aking mga mata’y kitang-kita ko ang gulat at takot sa mukha ni abbie. pasensya ka na, kuya.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/nlygsa/alex_tanghaling_tapat_ng_sabado_2021/,27 05 2021
Mga tanong para sa mga relihiyoso nating kababayan.,"1) iiwanan mo ba ang inyong pamilya at hanapbuhay (walang binigay na konteksto o dahilan na batay sa inyong doktrina) *dahil inutos lang ng inyong pastor*? 2) ikaw ba ay hahawak at baril at mag aaklas laban sa isang bansa dahil *ayon sa pananaw ng inyong lider ay ginigipit ang inyong paniniwala*? 3) kung ikaw ay isang hcw, tutulungan mo ba ang isang pasyenteng naghihingalo na *maraming duda sa relihiyon mo*? 4) lalahok ka ba sa isang *lantarang krimen*, dahil ""ang nais ng inyong mga pinuno ay higit sa batas ng isang bansa? 5) sino ang *priority* mo sa isang sakuna, ang kamag anak mong mahal na mahal mo, o ang mataas na pastor nyo na hindi mo naman kilala sa personal (nakita mo lang siya noon na namuno sa simba nyo 10 years ago)? 6) tatakas ka ba sa *mandatory na isolation* (house arrest/home quarantine) kasi nabalitaan mong bibisita sa lugar nyo ang isang mahalagang pastor? 7) kung ikaw ay abugado, sino tutulungan mo? yung *kilalang personalidad ng relihiyon* mo na obviously guilty sa isang mabigat na krimen (kaya ka nyang bayaran ng mas mataas sa professional fee mo), o *yung pamilya ng biktima* na nabubuhay sa hirap (ni sentimo hindi ka mabibigyan)? ayon sa mga sabi sabi sa lugar, hindi tinatago ng biktima na ayaw niya sa mga relihiyon, pero ang nangyari sa kanya ay *wala namang kinalaman rito*.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/gprjkb/mga_tanong_para_sa_mga_relihiyoso_nating_kababayan/,24 05 2020
"Habang wala pang nagaganap na official na inauguration. Malaya pa tayo! Wag tayong panghinaan ng loob.

Singsing,"mapait akong napangiti nang mapansin ko ang dalawang magkasintahan sa aking harapan. kitang kita ko ang saya sa mga mata ng babae at kung gaano kasincere ang lalaki kung tumingin sa kanya. napatikhim ako at nag-iwas ng tingin ng maramdam kong humapdi ang aking mga mata. dahil ibig ibig ko nang maiyak ng magbalik sa aking ala-ala ang nakaraan. \~ ""mailene!"" saway sa'kin ni ron nang nakawan ko siya ng halik sa kanyang pisngi. masaya kaming nagkakantahan at nagkekwentuhan sa loob ng kanyang sasakyan. binabaybay ang daan patungo sa batangas. ""what? ayaw mo ba na halikan kita?"" nakalabi kong tugon rito at nagcross arms sa kanya. sumilay ang kanyang matatamis na ngiti at kinuha ang aking kaliwang kamay kahit nagmamaneho siya. ""of course not!"" mabilis na sagot nito at saka dinugtong ""gustong gusto kong hinahalikan mo ako, gustong gusto ko yang labi mo kaya dapat kapag hahalikan mo ako yung siguradong nakaharap ako sayo ha?"" idiniin niya ang haplos sa aking palad at hinalikan ang likod nito. namula ako sa kanyang sinabi at tumango. huminto siya saglit sa pagmamaneho at hinatak niya ako palapit sa kanya at masuyong hinalikan ang aking labi. \~ napahugot ako ng malalim na hininga ng maalala ko ang mukha ni ron. napatingin ako sa singsing kong suot at di ko namalayan na basa na pala ang aking mga pisngi dahil sa luha. tumingin ako muli sa magkasintahan sa aking harapan at napangiti sa kanila. sana'y magtagal ang kanilang relasyon. hinatak ko na ang tali ng jeep at agad pumara ng makita ko na nandito na pala ako sa aking bababaan. sinuyod ko ng tingin ang pet shop at tumingin ulit sa aking cellphone upang tingnan ang message na kakatanggap ko lang. ""wait a bit. bumili lang ng ice cream"" napailing ako at napangiti ng malapad ng makita ang isang batang napakaganda sa di kalayuan. ""mom!"" sigaw ni ruine ng makita niya ako dahilan upang mapangiti ako. ""hi baby. how's your day?"" tanong ko at humalik ako sa kanyang pisngi at inayos ang kanyang tali sa buhok. ""super duper good, mom!"" may tumikhim sa'king likuran kaya lumingon ako rito ""ooohhh and tito alex bought me a rabbit"" napabagsak ang tingin ko sa cage na hawak ni alex at nakita ang isang kulay brown na rabbit. ""alex naman."" nakanguso kong tawag dito. he smirked at me at ginulo ang aking buhok. ""ron will be happy, mailene. gusto niya makitang masaya kayo ng anak mo."" sumikip ang dibdib ko sa kanyang sinabi. pinisil niya ang aking pisngi at inabot sakin ang cage upang mabuhat si ruine. alex is ron's bestfriend. siya ang naging father figure ni ruine. siya ang kasama ko noong nanganak ako, siya ang kasama ko ng unang beses magsalita ang anak ko ng ""mama"", siya ang kasama ko noong sinugod ko sa hospital si ruine ng lagnatin ito. si alex ang nagbantay sa amin ni ruine. kahit kailan ay hindi siya umalis sa tabi ko. itinaas ko ang cage na aking hawak at kinausap ang rabbit sa loob nito. ""katulad mo ako, nakakulong ka sa cage at nakakulong ako sa nakaraan."" napakagat labi ako ng marinig ko ang hagikgik ni ruine, napatingin ako sa likuran ni alex at buhat buhat niya ang aking anak. kitang kita ang saya ni ruine sa kanyang tito alex. humalik ito sa pisngi ng kanyang tito at ngumiti muli. sumunod na ako sa sasakyan ni alex, pinaupo niya ako sa passenger seat at inayos niya ang uupuan ni ruine sa likod katabi ang rabbit nito. sumakay na si alex at pinaandar ang sasakyan. nagulat ako ng kunin niya ang aking kamay kaya binawi ko ito sa kanya. ""pasensya na mai"" ngiting malungkot sakin ni alex ngunit di na ako tumugon. tumingin ako sa labas ng bintana habang dinarama ko ang singsing sa aking palasingsingan. \~ ""i promise, ikaw at ikaw lang sa buhay ko mailene."" pangako ni ron sa akin at isinuot sa akin ang singsing na napili niya. ""di pa nga ako nagsasabi ng yes eh!"" maktol ko rito pero nangingiti dahil parang sasabog ang puso ko. ""mahal, di mo man sabihin. alam ko, ramdam ko. pero magtatanong na lang ako ulit ha?"" napakagat ako ng labi ng pumunta siya sa aking likuran. papalubog na ang araw, nakatanaw sa karagatan. nagulat ako ng may naramdaman akong malamig sa aking leeg kasabay ng pagpatak ng luha ko ng may mga lobong paangat at nakasabit rito ang mga salitang... ""will you marry me, mailene?"" ikinabit niya sa leeg ko ang kwintas at iniharap niya ako sa kanya.

Inquiry about Anti-Rabies Vaccination,"hello po! ask ko lang sana if nagpa-inject at nakumpleto na yung anti-rabies vaccination previously, then nakalmot ulit ng pusa after several years, need pa rin ba kumpletuhin yung 4 dose ng anti-rabies vaccine or 2 anti-rabies booster shot na lang po ba need ko ipa-inject? for context, nakalmot po kasi ako ng pusang kalye last week, actually wala talaga akong plano dapat na magpaanti-rabies kasi maliit na kalmot lang naman sa legs, wala naman dugo na lumabas. malayo naman kako sa bituka, pero ramdam ko na mahapdi, kaya hinugasan ko lang ng sabon. kaso after few days, may napanood ako na balita na yung bata daw namatay a month after makalmot ng pusa. ako naman sa sobrang anxious eh kinabukasan nagpunta agad sa animal bite center para magpaturok ng anti-rabies. currently, naka 2nd visit na ako sa animal bite center (2 dose na naiturok sakin). nacurious lang kasi ako kung need ko pa ba kumpletuhin yung 4 dose ng vaccine? kasi nakagat na ko dati ng asong gala (10 years ago), alam ko nakumpleto ko na rin vaccine ko noon. may nabasa kasi ako na kapag nakagat o nakalmot daw ng pusa/aso, 2 booster shot na lang daw po ang kailangan kung previously naturukan na ng anti rabies? gusto ko lang po sana maconfirm. sobrang takot po kasi ako sa rabies dahil sa pagkaalam ko, kapag lumabas na daw po yung symptoms ng rabies eh sobrang fatal na raw po nito dahil di na raw yun kaya magamot at worst way to die daw po yun na mae-experience ng patient kapag kumalat na yung rabies. kaya ko rin po naitanong kasi medjo mabigat po kasi sa bulsa yung 650 per visit sa animal bite center since graduating student pa lang po kasi ako, no job at umaasa lang sa allowance ng magulang. nahihiya rin po ako manghingi sa parents ko kasi anti-vaxxed sila eh yung tipong pag may sakit ka sa albularyo ka pupunta tsaka tawas-tawas, dadalhin ka lang sa hospital kapag malala na sakit at nagaagaw buhay na, sayang daw kasi pera. ipon ko lang po kasi yung ibinayad ko sa center. although aware naman ako na libre sa public hospital, kaso sobrang haba ng pila, eh nagrereview po kasi ako for board exam kaya di po kaya ng time na pumila nang matagal.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/160yhcg/inquiry_about_antirabies_vaccination/,25 08 2023

"Sorry, but I think the internet is indeed a factor why many people are ""depressed"" right now, BUT that's not necessarily a bad thing.","so i saw this short clip on facebook. galing siya sa isang film featuring tony labrusca. tony told her mom he's depressed, and the mom went ballistic, saying shits like depression is just a trend online. while i don't believe that depression is a trend, i do think the internet is also a reason why more and more middle-class people claim they're depression. sa palagay ko, ito ay parehong panget at mabuti -- pero mas matimbang ang mabuti kesa panget. let's talk about why is it a bad thing first. simple lang: some people might misinterpret this validation, and rather than dealing with their pains, they became addicted to it and became their sort of comfort. kumbaga, the internet validation became a new form of addiction -- gaya ng kung bakit may mga nalululong sa online games, pagkain, at droga. i've observed this a lot in the west. halimbawa nga, some of them gets offended with the word ""fat"" or ""obese"". dapat daw plus-size or the new sexy ang tawag para di masakit sa pandinig. see? rather than dealing with their insecurity, they resorted to demonizing an adjective, and that's a bad thing. nagiging eggshell na ang mga tao, all for the sake of not offending someone who has issues. now, let's talk about the good thing. syempre, unang-una dyan ang validation ulit. gaya rin ng pagkain, online games, and even drugs, wala naman talagang masama sa validation *as long as* you know your limit. most of you probably already know sugar is addicting, and is probably more addicting than marijuana, but hey, we don't hear people asking to ban sugar. even nutritionists themselves aren't saying that. ang lagi lang nilang sinasabi ay hinay-hinay lang. if you consumed it moderately, sobrang helpful iyon sa katawan mo especially if you're physically active. ganoon din sa validation. maraming middle class/rich kid na lumaki sa toxic positivity mindset. because of this, their frustrations were forced to repress simply because someone had it worse. pinagdaanan ko rin ito, sa totoo lang. my grandma loves to tell me na swerte ako dahil marino si papa at malaki ang sahod kaya hindi ko naranasan maghirap noon. anong naging epekto sakin? i was forced to conceal my angsts. dahil hindi ko mailabas, naipon lang nang naipon sa dibdib ko. parang naging time bomb siya, and it exploded in 2019, after my break-up with my long-term boyfriend. i felt so miserable. i'm still dealing with numbness and suicidal ideation until now. mabuti na lang, i have a good support group. gusto ko sanang mag-therapy pero ayoko kasi ng epekto ng gamot sakin, so i chose not to seek it. what could have happened if iba ang upbringing ko? i probably would have a better coping mechanism. right now, my coping mechanism is being workaholic, since it helps me distract myself from pain, pero hindi rin maganda ito. dami ko ngang pera pero di naman ako masaya sa buhay ko. that's why right now, i'm learning to balance my social life and work. heck, pati sex life and fitness, i'm slowly incorporating it to my lifestyle. isa pang bagay na maganda sa awareness ng mental health online ay yung mapuputol na natin ang siklo. let's admit it, one of the reasons why the gen xers and the generation earlier romanticized hard work and abuses so much is because ganoon sila pinaniwala. kaya nga karamihan sa mga toxic boss at customer ay mga galing sa henerasyon na ito. karamihan sa kanila ay mayroong anger management issue. naalala ko nga sa first job ko, i was bullied by my workmates, who are mostly 40+ and older. natutuwa kasi boss namin sakin dahil mabilis ako magtrabaho, and these people saw me as a threat, so they're bullying me through cold treatment. tapos lagi pa akong pinagchichismisan, at hindi rin ako sinasabihan kapag may announcement. it’s affecting my job a lot. so iyon, umalis ako after six months. nagalit si tita ko sakin, saying i should just shrug it off. imagine, rather than saying ang toxic ng ka-work ko, ako pa ang mali? but then, iyon kasi ang kinagisnan nilang buhay. through the mh awareness, the younger generation can break this cycle. we learn to be kinder and be less tolerant to bullshit like this, and i think that’s the best part. after all, bukod sa mali naman talaga ang bullying, counterproductive din ito, lalo na sa office. halimbawa na nga lang itong experience ko sa first work ko. natutuwa si boss sakin because i’m efficient. that efficiency decreased because of the bullying. remember, from an economic perspective, productivity loss will also result in income loss, which sadly many insecure coworkers didn’t know. hindi lang ako ang apektado kundi ang kumpanyang pinagtratrabahuhan nila. in the long run, sila rin ang maapektuhan sa ganitong kultura. and speaking of efficiency, mh awareness also improves it. think about it: hindi ka makakapagtrabaho nang matino kung burnt out ka, hindi ba? and this is not just anecdotal evidence. years ago, microsoft japan conducted a study to know what would happen if they implement a 4-day work system. japan is notorious for their overworking culture, so this is frowned upon. and surprisingly, mas malaki pa ang income nila during the time 4-day work happens. mas productive ang mga tao dahil hindi sila masyadong pagod. hindi rin uso yung pinapabagal ang trabaho para lang mapagkasya ng eight hours ang pwede sanang gawin within 3-4 hour. and nakatipid pa sila sa operating expenses dahil tatlong araw na walang gumagamit ng office. see? efficient, and it all started because microsoft is trying to improve the mental health state of their employees. the verdict? the internet does play a factor on why more people are self-diagnosing. but if you think about it, the benefits outweigh the liability. hindi lang natin natutulungan ang mga tao, but it would also improve the economy. it’s a win-win suggestion. recommendation? normalize validating your pain, but don’t overdo it as it would lead to addiction in the long run.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/oco9gn/sorry_but_i_think_the_internet_is_indeed_a_factor/,3 07 2021
"Bakit sa Pilipinas 400cc na Motorcycle hindi ""beginner bike"" pero sa ibang bansa ang 400cc bike considered na starter bike","background: i've been driving 4 wheels for the past 7 years. i'm in good physical condition, and in the young side (24 years old). i know how to ride a bicycle. i've been looking to buy a a motorcycle para di na humiram ng kotse kay erpats kapag may gusto ako puntahan. pinag iisipan ko bumili ng motor dahil traffic sa atin, requirement ko na dapat makapasok sa expressway ung motor (sa south provinces ako nakatira, sa manila ang work, kailangan expressway access). i'm considering buying ""beginner"" 400cc big bikes (cfmoto nk400, ktm duke 390 etc). the majority of our users sa philippine fb groups and mc forums all say na: -sa scooter mag start -delikado 400cc -mabigat 400cc bike, dapat masanay ka muna sa small displacement bike and they all have valid points. i don't plan to buy a motorcycle without knowing how to ride it, so i enrolled at honda safety driving center sa bicutan sa beginner course, then advanced course after. then i'll buy the bike. is this a good decision? as much as i want to ride a motorcycle, i don't have a death wish. tldr; can someone who will have about 40-50 hours motorcycle experience, start on a 400cc motorcycle?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/hpmunz/bakit_sa_pilipinas_400cc_na_motorcycle_hindi/,12 07 2020

I have mixed emotions on my mother,"i (21) am a university student that is struggling financially and currently having conflicting thoughts about my mom. medyo lengthy itong story ko, lalo sa background ko. please bear with me from birth until today, i live in my grandparents' home. i only had my father acting as my parent when i was a child. i was raised by my grandparents' and a nanny. my lola passed away when i was 6 years old. my father died when i was 15. my lolo, a year later, passed away which i was 16 at the time. all my life, i didn't live with my mother which will be explained by the next paragraph. heto naman ang setup ng family-parents situation ko. my mother actually has her own first family before she had me. i had 3 siblings way older than i am. my father on the hand, ako lang anak niya. bata pa lang ako, ipinaalam na sa'kin ng papa ko about sa sitwasyon ko sa mama ko pati pamilya ng nanay ko. which i obediently accepted and shrugged off as a child. i had loving grandparents. may bahay na tinitirhan, hindi mayaman pero sumasakto lang kahit minsan nagigipit papa ko. yung mga gastusin naman noon sa bahay, naging sagot ng grandparents ko. kaya pagpapaaral lang halos at sariling gamit ko mga gastusin ng papa ko. so ayon, naging komportable ako. hindi ko na inisip pa manawagan sa nanay ko bilang magulang like call her obligation out sa'kin. saka bata pa ako, what would i know haha kainis sana namulat agad ako sa reyalidad. so okay naman ako sa nanay ko. pati rin sa tatay. hindi naman ako nagalit dahil sa sitwasyon. nung medyo nasa junior high school na ako, doon ko mas madalas nakikita nanay ko at nakakasamang lumabas for the day. siyempre for the day lang, tinatago ako sa pamilya niya eh. yung panganay lang na anak nakakakilala at alam sa sitwasyon sa'kin. asawa at yung 2 other na anak ng nanay ko, hindi. nag-aabot-abot naman noon nanay ko pero hindi sustento eh. abot lang to help kapag meron siya maiaabot. so namatay tatay ko (rip). naiwan pa rin ako sa bahay ng grandparents ko (hanggang today). naging obligasyon naman ako ng isang kapatid ng papa ko. hindi rin naman sila mayayaman pero mas angat siguro nang kaunti sa papa ko. laking pasalamat ko at kahit hindi nila ako anak, hindi nila ako pinabayaan at pinaalis sa bahay ng grandparents ko. sa panahon na yon, ako lang saka distant cousin (adult working age) lang residents ng bahay. yung distant cousin ko na yon is nakikishare sa bills sa bahay. from when i was 15 ganon at sitwasyon. until early 2023, nagmove out pinsan ko dahil sa eskandalo na ginawa niya but not relevant to my story. may pinsan (shs student age) din akong nagmove in sa bahay na isang anak ng tito ko na ka-share sa bills nung distant cousin ko. bakit dito nagmove in pinsan ko na 'yon? similar parent situation sa'kin (2 for 2 messed up members of my family). at dahil doon, naging mabigat na responsibilidad sa tito ko ang bahay na 'to ngayong 2023. electricity bill, water bill, internet bill, pagkain naming magpinsan na pang-araw-araw, tuition ng pinsan ko, at iba pang sensitibong info na hindi ko na is-share. dahil doon, nakiusap sa'kin ang tito ko na makihati ako sa bills ng bahay gamit yung pension na natirang perang naiwan sa'kin ng papa ko. bawat buwan, magbigay daw ako ng 1000 pesos para sa bills tapos siya na sa iba. sakit sa'kin financially no'n pero wala ako nagagawa. tapos kapag wala raw siyang pera para sa bills or ibang gastusin sa bahay, ako muna raw gumastos at ilista ko bilang utang. so kung gumastos ako para sa bahay ng 2000 for the month, 'yung 1000 doon ay bigay ko na talaga huhu tapos 'yung 1000 ay utang daw muna. financially pressured ako. buti na lang under free tuition ako sa pinapasukan ko ngayong college. gagastusan ko na lang other academic expenses ko. pero limited na lang talaga natitirang pension savings na hawak ko haha. expectancy is 2-3 years tapos strict budget pa 'yon. swerte pa kung abutin ng 3 years. jusko mga gastusin at nagmamahal pang cost of living. so ayon. sorry sa napakahabang background. eto na 'yung problema ko sa mama ko. mga last month, nagmessage ako sa mama ko. i kindly explained my situation sa mama ko. para ngang nagmamakaawa na ako. like ngayon lang talaga ako humingi ng sustento sa mama ko. hindi niya ako nireplyan ever, sineen lang message ko. sobrang financially frustrated ako, hindi ako nagfollow up sa nanay ko. dagdag pa yung realization ko na dapat ginagampanan ng magulang yung obligasyon niya sa anak kahit financially man lang para maka-get by yung anak kaso hindi ganun sitwasyon ko eh. normally kapag hihingi ako ng tulong sa nanay ko noon, it's either sasabihin na wait lang ako for a few days and padadalhan niya ako or kung wala siya pera, sasabihin naman niya na wala siyang pera that time at ieexplain yung gastusin niya sa mga medical fees at gamot niya. siyempre dahil maintindihin naman ako, tinatanggap ko yung sitwasyon. kapag nakakapagpadala naman siya, nagpapasalamat din naman ako nang maayos. hindi naman ako nagsasabi dun sa mga kapatid ko sa kaniya kasi hindi naman nila kagagawan kung bakit may kapatid sila sa labas eh. di naman nila ako obligasyon. kaya sa nanay ko lang ako nalapit. kaso ayun nga, i got neglected and ignored. sa tito ko naman, never naman ako binother na humingi ng tulong sa nanay ko. she's like considered as someone i can depend on for them. pero if i can get help, makakatulong 'yon sa tito ko and he won't mind. but he doesn't initiate anything about my mother. hindi ko na pino-problema 'yung emotional and mental nurturing ng magulang eh kahit dati pa. masustentuhan lang ako, i'm fine with it para lang maka-get by ako sa bawat araw pati for the long term na hindi pa ako fully independent. it's so frustrating being financially struggling while being an orphan and coming from a broken family. i posted this lang so i could let it out. ps. i have my own plans on getting opportunities to financially help myself na hindi related sa pamilya ko. wala pa nga lang kasiguraduhan 'yung mga 'yon kaya hindi ko kinwento at kaya pressured pa rin ako financially.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/161q3si/i_have_mixed_emotions_on_my_mother/,26 08 2023
Tagalized - Morgue.,"may nakita akong isang ad sa dyaryo, hindi man ako maka-paniwala at kinilabutan pero nakaka-anyaya ang sinasabi. ""gusto mo bang kumita ng 1000 pesos per night bilang security sa morge? apply na!"" medyo matagal na rin akong walang trabaho at makaka-bayad na rin ako ng upa at makapa-mamumuhay ng maginhawa kung magkataon. kaya naman nag-apply ako kahit medyo nag-dalawang-isip, inaasahan ko nang hindi ako makaka-kuha ng kahit anong sagot mula sa kumpanya. pero wala pang dalawang oras ay may natanggap akong email mula sa employer: ""maraming salamat sa ipinasa mong application form para sa posisyong night guard sa morge. masaya kong ibinabalita na ang mga skills na iyong binanggit ay tugma para sa hinahanap namin sa isang guard at gusto kitang offeran ng isang taong kontrata. kung ika'y sumasang-ayon sa mga kasunduan sa ibaba, maari lamang mag-iwan ka ng signature online via e-signature na naka-lista sa baba at pumunta ka sa (redacted) eksakto alas diyes ngayong gabi. makaka-tanggap ka ng 5000 linggo-linggo na direkta sa iyong bangko."" ngayong gabi? hindi ba masaydong mabilis ang mga pangyayari? pero hindi na ako nag-reklamo o tanong pa. hindi ko alam kung anong aasahan o kung sino ang madadatnan ko doon, kaya sinuot ko na 'yung damit at pantalon ko at agad nagtungo sa nasabing address nang mas maaga sa itinakdang oras. nandoon na ako ng mga alas nwebe kwarenta 'y singko ng gabi at may isang middle aged na lalaki na mukhang nag-tatrabaho sa morge ang bumati sa akin. ""hi, michael, tama? ako nga pala si james."" - doon ay nag-kamayan kami at nag-kangitian - ""alam ko na pinapunta ka dito sa kabila ng maikling abiso, pero sadyang nanganga-ilangan ng bagong gwardiya ang kumpanya na nag-hire sa atin dito agad-agad para ngayong gabi."" ""edi padala ako mula sa security company sa morge n'yo?"" - tanong ko. ""tama ka. nagta-trabaho ka sa isang outsourcing security company at sa alam ko, malaki sila mag-bayad. malay mo, mas maging mataas pa ang posisyon mo sa hinaharap."" - sabay kindat. ""ok. ano naman ang mga trabaho ko dito..."" pagsisimula ko. ""ahh, 'yun. wala naman gaano, siguraduhin mo lang na walang makakapasok."" - lumapit s'ya sa akin at sinabing - ""o labas."" isang maikling katahimikan at nagtinginan kaming dalawa, doon ay napa-ngiti ito at ang sabi: ""de, joke lang. so ayun, tapos na 'yung shift ko, kaya naman mauuna na ako. basta doon ka lang sa office at mag-relax hanggang alas sais ng umaga. doon darating na 'yung kahalili mo."" at doon nga ay umalis na s'ya. umupo ako sa upuan sa may office. akala ko siguro naman walang hindi magandang mangyayari. may papel sa harap ko at habang tinitignan ko ito ay doon ko lang napagtanto na ito ay listahan ng mga rules na specifically naka-asign sa akin. ito ang sabi: sa bagong gwardiya. welcome to the company. sa baba ay ang listahan ng mga rules para sa iyong trabaho: 1. ang una mong dapat gawin ay ang mag-conduct ng full sweep sa buong area para siguraduhin na walang kakaibang mga nangyayari liban sa ordinary (pati sa crypt). important note: kung may katawan man na naka-labas sa chambers sa loob ng crypt, itulak mo lamang ito pabalik. dapat manatili silang nasa-loob sa lahat ng pagkakataon. 2. matapos ang buong sweep, maari ka nang manatili sa loob ng office hanggang matapos ang shift mo. may iba pang mga rules na naka-lista sa baba, pero nag-desisyon akong libutin muna ang buong lugar. medyo may kaliitan ang morge, may isang malaking medical room na halos mapuno ng medical supplies ang loob. pero may sapat na espasyo para sa 2-3 lamesa na puwedeng pag-lagyan ng mga labi. sa loob ng crypt ay may palikuran. nag-desisyon akong unahin na ang pinaka-ayaw kong lugar - 'yung crypt. umalis na ako sa office at binuksan ang solid at napaka-bigat na pinto ng crypt, agad-agad ay sinalubong ako ng napaka-lamig na hangin. sa loob, may dalawang katawan sa gitna ng kwarto at mga chambers sa pader. lahat naman sila ay sarado kaya naman mabilis akong lumabas ng kwarto. habang pabalik ako mula sa bathroom, may nakita akong lalaki na naka lab coat na naka-tayo sa gitna ng medical room. parang may kinakalikot gamit ang mga medical tools malapit sa isang body bag. ""tang... tinakot mo naman ako boss."" - sabi ko. tinignan n'ya ako na parang wala lang at bumalik sa ginagawa nito. ""akala ko umuwi na ang lahat. ako nga pala si michael, bagong gwardiya."" - sabi ko, gaya ng nauna, hindi n'ya ako pinansin. kumaway na ako at umalis pabalik ng office. babasahin ko na sana ulit ang mga rules ng biglang may matinis na tunog akong narinig na para bang may bakal na kumi-kiskis sa isa pang bakal na nag-eecho sa buong building. medyo mahina na ito at parang nang-gagaling sa mga tubo. tumagal din iyon ng ilang segundo at huminto sa kaparehas na segundo. hindi ko na lang pinansin at i-idlip na lang, check ng cell phone. pero medyo tumatagal na ang tunog at habang mas kinikilabutan ako ay unti-unti nang nagbabago ang kanina'y parang bakal na kumi-kiskis sa isa't-isa ay naging... ungol. lumabas ako ng office at tatanungin ko sana 'yung kaninang naka lab coat pero mukhang naka-uwi na s'ya sa mga oras na 'yun. hindi ako sigurado kung saan mismo nang-gagaling ang tunog, pero parang sa may crypt, kaya naman pinuntahan ko ito. 'yung oras na binuksan ko ang pinto ay ang buong building ay nanahimik. huminga ako ng malalim at napansin ko na 'yung isang chambers ay naka-bukas na ng bahagya. tinulak ko ito pabalik at agad-agad na bumalik sa office. nawala na ng tuluyan ang matinis na na para bang ungol na iyon. nagpatuloy ako sa pagbabasa: 3. maari kang matulog sa office, pero dapat handa ka sa mga mangyayari. sleep at your own risk, ika nga nila. matapos nun ay isang napaka-lakas na tunog ang halos mag-patalon sa buong pagkatao ko. ""tulong! palabasin n'yo ako dito!"" - ang boses ay tila nang-gagaling sa mga tubo. tumayo ako habang sobra ang kalabog ng dibdib ko. ""palabasin n'yo ako, hindi ako maka-hinga!"" - paulit-ulit na pagmama-kaawa ng boses na ngayon ay may kasama ng kalabog. binuksan ko ang pintuan ng office at sa hindi malaman na dahilan sa crypt nang-gagaling ang boses. nanginginig, pero binuksan ko ang pinto. ""buhay pa ako, isa itong pagkakamali! tulong!"" - mas lalong lumakas ang boses nung oras na buksan ko ang napaka-bigat at solidong pinto. ""asan ka?!"" - nanginginig akong tumingin sa paligid, habang ang walang humpay na tumatawag ang boses na may kasamang malalakas na kalabog. lumapit ako at unti-unting inilapit ang tenga para maka-siguro na ang bubuksan ko ay ang tamang chamber. ""buhay pa ako! utang na loob! ple----"" ang boses at ang mga kalabog ay daglian na lamang nawala nang biglaan kong binuksan ang isa sa mga chambers at sinalubong ako ng malamig na bangkay ng isang middle-aged na lalaki. tumayo lang ako doon, nakatitig sa bangkay, halos tumigil sa pagtakbo ang isip ko sa kung ano ang mga nangyayari. malinaw na malinaw kong narinig at naramdaman ko ang bawat kalabog nung oras na hinawakan ko ang hawakan ng chamber at para bang may kung sino man na bigla-bigla na lang nagpatigil nito. pinaglalaruan lang ba ako ng aking isipan? tinulak ko ang chamber pabalik at mabilis na umalis doon, nilock ang pinto ng office. iniisip ko na ang pag-aaply sa trabahong 'to ay maaring isang malaking pagkakamali. pakiramdam ko na nababaliw na ako, pero agad ko ring kinumbinse ang sarili ko na nasa ulo ko lang lahat ng 'to. nagpatuloy ako sa pagbabasa ng mg rules: 4. puwede kang mag-patugtog para maibsan ang katahimikan basta't hindi ito makaka-kuha ng atensyon sa labas. 5. kung may marinig kang hindi mo maipaliwanag na ingay galing sa may crypt, 'wag mo na lamang ito pansinin. 6. kung ang mga ingay na 'yun ay naging sigaw ng pagpapanic, gawin ang mga sumusunod: • kung ang mga sigaw ay mula sa babae, 'wag mo pansinin hanggang sa tumigil ito. 'wag na 'wag kang papasok sa loob ng crypt sa mga oras na nangyayari ito sa kahit anong dahilan. • kung ang mga ingay ay mula sa lalaki, hanapin ang pinag-mumulan ng ingay at hatakin ang chamber. dapat huminto na ang ingay pagkatapos mong mabuksan ang chamber. doon na nagtatapos ang page. nilapag ko na ang papel at dahan-dahang inilapat ang likod ko sa upuan. ala una na noon at nag-sisimula na akong antukin. maya-maya pa ay nagsisimula ng pumikit ang aking mga mata ng kusa. nagsisimula na akong mahulog sa panaginip nang biglang may mahigpit akong hawak na naramdaman sa likod ng aking balikat. sa sobrang gulat ko ay agad-agad akong napatayo at sinipa ang upuan. walang tao o kahit ano noong mga oras na iyon. hindi na ako inaantok nung mga oras na 'yun. tahimik na ang buong kapaligiran noon at nagpunta ako sa palikuran. pagbalik ko ay alas tres na at halos handa na akong tapusin ang shift ko dito. napagisip-isip ko na hindi na rin masama para sa isang libo, hanggang tinalikod ko ang papel na may mga rules at napansin kong may naka-sulat pa sa likod: 7. lahat ng staff ay lalabas o dapat nasa labas na ng building bago mag alas diyes ng gabi, kaya kung may makita kang lalaki na naka lab coat during your shift, 'wag na 'wag sa kahit ano mang sitwasyon na subukan mong makipag-usap sa kanya. paulit-ulit-ulit kong binasa ang rule ng limang beses, pero wala pa ring nagbabago sa naka-sulat. may mahinang katok sa pinto ng office. tinignan ko ito at sa likod ng salamin ay nakita ko ang lalaking naka lab coat naka-ngiti sa akin. alas kwatro 'y media na at patuloy pa rin s'ya sa pagkatok. sa mga magta-tanong, hindi ko na ho alam kung saan ko ito nakuha dahil 2018 ko pa po ito tinagalog. nakita ko lang na naka-save pa rin sa note ng selpon ko. salamat and ang init. tangina.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/t8j464/tagalized_morgue/,7 03 2022
Tagalized Story.,"may story ako. ako lang ang nag-iisang babae sa pinag-tatrabahuhan kong kumpanya at alam ko na kung bakit. isa akong fresh graduate sa kolehiyo at gusto ko na talagang makapag-simula ng career agad-agad na walang kinalaman sa pagse-serve ng pagkain, pagpupunas ng mga gamit, o pag-dadala o timpla ng kape sa isang matandang negosyante. sa naka-sanayan nag-aapply ako sa trabaho na may anim na araw na trabaho at marami-rami na rin akong interview na napagdaanan. alam ko na ang tinapos kong hrm na kurso ay hindi gaanong makaka-kuha ng magandang oportunidad, pero naniniwala pa rin ako na may mas maganda pang trabaho na naghihintay sa akin. kaya naman nanatili akong positibo, matyaga, at nag-aapply lang sa mga office jobs na may magandang benipisyo. kahit halos wala na akong mapag-kunan ng makakain dahil sa magastos na mga interview, at least mapapag-tibay naman nito ang kakaunting pride na natitira sa akin. halos tatlong linggo na rin ang nakalipas, may isa akong phone interview sa isang internet security company. ang kumpanyang iyon ay maraming offices sa amin at naghahanap sila ng bagong customer support specialist para sa kanilang international department. ang mga requirements ay maganda o mahinahon na boses, good spoken and written grammar, kakaunting tech-knowledge, at may kakayahang mag-trabaho sa umaga at gabi. ang office ay dalawang sakay lang sa mula sa amin, at mayroon silang magandang offer sa health insurance. nag-aapply ako kahit lmitado lang din ang alam ko sa computer science. naging maayos naman ang phone interview at matapos ang dalawang meetings sa hr at sa management, binigyan nila ako ng isang napaka-gandang offer (kahit na wala pa talaga akong experience sa kahit anong trabaho). sa loob ng unang linggo ko, kailangan kong magtrabaho nang regular shift na 9-5 (am) para maging online ako kasabay ng manager ko, na nag-trabaho sa ibang branch ng kumpanya. pagkatapos noon ay kailangan kong magtrabaho para sa regular na schedule ko bilang support - ang schedule ko ay 6 na araw na pasok (09:00 am -05:00 pm (am) at may isang araw na night shift 09:00 pm - 05:00 am respectively). sa unang araw ko, ang suot ko ay isang loose na sweater at mahabang skirt. bilang sa kaalaman ko ay sa ganitong uri ng trabaho ay karamihan mga lalaki ang empleyado, ayaw ko naman mag-cause ng unnecessary attention dahil sa provocatively o inappropriately pag-susuot ng hindi naayon na attire. ang lalaki sa front desk ay mukha namang maayos na tao. pinakilala n'ya ang sarili n'ya bilang si andrew bago n'ya ako tulungang mag-fill out ng mga paperwork at sinamahan n'ya na ako sa aking mesa at sa isang open space na workspace. nakatitig lang ako sa tila walang katapusang mga desks habang naglalakad kami, napansin ko na halos hindi mo makikita ang mga mukha ng bawat taong nagta-trabaho na naka-upo sa bawat desks. wala man lang akong nakita o napansin na babae habang nag-lalakad kami sa tila baga'y walang katapusang workspace na iyon, na talaga namang hindi normal at nakaka-bahala. kahit ang kalmadong presensya ni andrew ay hindi kayang maiwaglit ang wari kakaibang pakiramdam na naka-tuon sa akin. halos maubusan ako ng hininga ng maramdaman ko ang mga presensya ng bagong kong co-workers na tila nagsasabi na ""hindi ka nababagay dito"". nagulat ako ng biglang huminto si andrew sa isang desk na napuno ng mga printed memes, floral stickers, at isang lumang keychain na naka-patong sa harap ng monitor. bukod pa doon ay natatakpan na rin ng makapal na alikabok ang keyboard, monitor at ang natitirang ispasyo ng desk. ""ahhh... anong nangyari..."" sabi ni andrew sa medyo upset na boses. ""pasensya ka na."" sabi nito habang nakatingin sa aking mga papeles. ""ah... aya. dapat matagal na 'tong nalinis. kailangan kong maka-usap ang custodian"". ""ok lang 'yun"", sagot ko. ""puwede ko namang punasan na lang 'yan, wala namang problema"". medyo asiwa na noon si andrew, pero habang ginagala ko ang aking paningin ay malinaw na wala ng ibang bakanteng desk maliban doon. mabilis na natapos ang araw na iyon. natutunan ko na ang mga dapat kung gawin na sumagot sa support related phone calls at gumawa ng bagong ticket para sa system. kailangan ko ring i-monitor ang lahat ng pumapasok na chats at written tickets at isaayos ito base sa level ng urgency at type nito. hindi naman ako required mag-bigay ng technical advice, pero dapat maging pamilyar ako sa aming product software. bilang wala pa namang mga tawag ay pinaki-alaman ko muna ang manual. halos wala akong maintindihan sa mga naroon kaya naman ginogle ko na lang ang karamihan na nasa manual. kinumusta ako noon ng manager ko at mukhang hindi s'ya masaya sa mga lapses ko sa mga materials. dahil pakiramdam ko wala akong matinong nagawa at gagawin sa mga oras na iyon ay panandalian akong nag-break para linisin ang mesa ko. tumayo ako para tanungin si andrew kung saan makaka-kuha ng basahan para sa mesa ko. agad-agad kong pinagsisihan ang desisyon kong iyon. ang bawat mata sa kwarto ay tila napako sa pagtayo ko sa aking kinauupuan. hindi ako sigurado pero maraming mga bulungan akong narinig habang papalayo ako sa aking mesa. ang kaninang maingay na mga keyboard ay pahina nang pahina na halos kainin na ako ng lupa sa sobrang hindi ko pagiging kumportable at self-conscious na rin at the same time. napansin ko na lang na halos halikan ko na ang dibdib ko sa pagyuko para lang hindi ako mapansin. bago ako maka-rating sa isang palikong daan patungo sa front desk ay buong-lakas kong tinignan ang isang tila walang hiyang lalaki na nakatitig sa akin. hindi ko alam kung ano ang inaasahan ko, pero 'yung overall appearance ng lalaking naka-hooding pang-asar na 'yun ay nagbigay ng matinding kilabot sa buong katawan ko. siguro mga ka-edad ko s'ya pero hindi man lang s'ya nahiya o natinag sa pagkaka-titig n'ya sa akin sa kabila ng pagtitig ko sa kanya na may halong pagka-bwisit at inis. isang kakila-kilabot na ngiti ang sumilaw sa mga labi nito habang naka-titig sa parteng bukong-bukong ng aking mga paa at dahan-dahan itong bumalik sa kanyang monitor. inisip ko kung anong magiging reaksyon n'ya kapag tinitigan ko rin ng kaparehong paraan ng pagtitig n'ya sa akin ang tinitigyawat n'yang leeg. parehong reaksyon pa rin ang nakuha ko habang naglalakad ako pabalik sa aking mesa kasama ang box ng computer wipes sa mga kamay ko. may maganda ring nangyari sa araw na iyon. habang nililinis ko ang mga drawer ng mesa ko ay may nakita akong half-used notebook mula sa nakaraang nagta-trabaho sa mesa ko. hindi n'ya nilagay ang first name n'ya, kundi initial lang at last name: j. espiritu. pero, base sa dekorasyon ng notebook, sigurado ako na babae rin s'ya kagaya ko. ang mga naiwan n'yang gamit ay nagbigay ng kapanatagan sa akin, pero 'yung notebook ang talagang pumukaw ng atensyon ko. doon ay sinabi nito ang pina-ikli at simpleng manual gamit ang easy-to-undertand terms at mga explenasyon sa nakaka-litong terminolohiya at komplikadong panuto sa manual. sa tulong n'ya ay nasurpresa ko ang aking manager sa aking product knowledge pagkatapos ng shift ko. matapos ang isang magandang araw ay buong tapang akong gumala sa office at nag-explore sa pantry. binenta ni andrew sa akin ang top-notch coffee machine at snacks sa nasabing pantry, tutal nagugutom na rin naman ako matapos ang isang emotionally, intellectually and productive na araw na 'yun. (ansabe). tsaka, medyo butas na rin 'yung bulsa at namumula na ang mga credit cards ko, kaya naman ayos na ako sa ilang pirasong masasarap na cookies. habang papalapit ako ay may narinig akong malakas na usapan at tawanan sa pantry. sa katangahan ko ay inisip ko na baka naman mas mainit, friendly o kahit maka-tao na sila sa akin. subalit ang maliit na pantry ay napuno ng katahimikan the moment na pumasok ako sa pantry. may limang lalaki doon na mag-kakaiba ang edad at lalaki na naka-upo sa palibot ng isang maliit na lamesa, at lahat sila ay naka-titig na direkta sa akin. ""panget na araw?"" - tugon ng isang pang-asar na boses. agad kong itinaas ang ulo ko mula sa pagkaka-titig sa sahig para hanapin ang pinag-mulan ng boses. hindi naging mahirap sa aking hanapin at malaman na mula iyon sa naka-hoodie na walang-hiyang tumitig sa akin nung nakaraan lang. ""siguro marami ka ng experience?"" - sambit pa nito sa nakaka-asar na tono at may-unting pag-taas ng kilay. ""para makakuha ng komportableng trabaho. siguro sikat ka?"". ""ano 'to, high-school?"" - sagot ko sa malakas na boses. hindi ko hilig kumompronta ng tao, pero sobra na 'to. hostility is one thing, social awkwardness is another, pero pakiramdam ko isa 'tong 80's na high-school drama na mga trenta anyos ang mga bida bilang mga teenagers. ""nandito lang ako para kumuha kape at kung may problema ka sa trabaho ko, puwede mong dalhin sa hr kung ano man ang issue mo"". nagpatuloy ako habang ine-enjoy ang namumutla at pahiyang mukha ng mga taong 'yun. mabuti naman, gusto kong maramdaman nila ang katiting na discomfort na buong araw kung kinakaharap. pinili kong lumayo sa aking mga co-workers, naglakad ako ng taas noo pabalik sa mesa ko na may hawak-hawak na tasa ng kape. bago pa ako maka-upo at enjoyin ang masarap na kape, napansin kong may isang mensahe galing sa hindi kilalang number: ""you have quite an attitude, don't you?"" nanigas ako habang hawak ang cell phone sa isa kong kamay at kape sa kabila. habang prino-proseso ko ang tila breach sa personal security ko, naka-tanggap ulit ako ng dalawa pang mensahe. isa ay ang hubo't-hubad kong katawan na sinend ko sa una kong serious college boyfriend. ang pangalawa: ""bakit hindi mo ngayon ibigay 'yang picture sa hr?"" sa totoo lang, sobrang naapektuhan ako sa invasion ng privacy ko. pumasok ang kahihiyan sa akin at sobrang naiinis ako for drawing so much unwanted attention sa sarili ko. kasalanan ko lahat 'to. pumasok ako sa isang office na puno ng ethical hackers na may pare-parehong pangalan ng aso bilang password. walang duda na ang litratong iyon ay umiikot na sa buong office at lahat ng iyon ay salamat sa walang hiyang ka-trabaho ko, at isa na akong kakatuwang tao sa loob ng office. hindi ko na ginalaw ang kape ko at umuwi na lang, habang pinipigilan ko ang bawat emosyon na bumuhos hanggang makarating ako sa safety ng bahay. halos hindi ako matigil sa kaiiyak nung gabing 'yun, iniisip ko na ang mga mukha ng mga ka-trabaho ko habang tigang na tigang na nakatitig sa hubad kong katawan. mga alas tres na ng madaling araw, doon ko lang na-realize na wala ng kwenta para pa magpaka-lunod ako sa kahihiyan. kailangan kong gumawa ng plano para maka-survive sa ganitong uri ng workplace. quitting is not an option kasi masyadong malaki ang pasweldo nila para tumigil ako. tsaka, halos tinapay na lang ang kaya kong bilhin sa araw-araw. ang pangalawa kong option ay pumunta sa hr, but there's no way i was going to open that can of worms. hindi ko mapapatunayan kong sino talaga ang nag-send ng mga mensahe na iyon. last option? stick with it, keep my head down, gawin ang trabaho na pinasukan ko at 'wag pansinin ang iba pang mga harassment na gagawin nila. 'yun nga ang ginawa ko. sa kabuuan ng isang linggong training ko ay pumapasok ako on time, hindi ako umaalis sa desk ko liban na lang kung pupunta sa palikuran. iniwasan ko rin ang kahit anong contact kanino man at pinanatili ko lang ang aking mga mata sa mga inanimate objects. salamat kay j. espiritu, palagi akong on top ng training ko. sa bawat bagong task na galing sa manager ko, laging may katumbas na entry sa kanyang notebook. wala ng nakaka-gagong texts at face-to-face na kumprontasyon, pero mayroong kakatuwang pakiramdam na panibagong sisira sa kalagayan ko. sa darating na biyernes na ang huling training ko, na nagdala sa akin sa huling entry sa notebook. night shift survival guide: - matulog sa buong umaga bago ang shift at 'wag na 'wag kang matutulog. - walang sino man ang dapat maka-pasok. - panatilihing may pepper spray na dala. (sa kahit anong sitwasyon). - i-check ang bawat aisle, meeting rooms. huwag kalimutang i-check ang ilalim ng lamesa, balkonahe, kitchen tables at kahit likod ng cooler. - laging mag-open ng skype na naka-ready sa emergency in case na hindi gumana ang mobile services. - panatilihing updated sa kaibigan/pamilya/lover kada oras. ang nasabing listahan ay medyo may kahulugan. una, sabi ng hr puwede naman akong matulog sa pagitan ng 2-5 am, basta malapit palagi sa akin ang office smartphone. mayroon nga silang pull out couch sa isang conference room para lang talaga sa ganitong sitwasyon. pangalawa, ang buong shift ay phone calls, kaya palaging may paraan para maka-tawag mula sa office phone, tama? lastly, ang mga naka-outlined sa ""guide"" ay parang o.a at paranoid. siguro 'yung listahan ay satirical? (ewan ko). siguro si espiritu parehas kami ng pakiramdam tungkol sa mga tila patay gutom na mga asong cold-blooded na co-workers? pero 'yung isip ko nag-tatrabaho ng sobra-sobra para makita ang logic sa likod ng mga pag-iingat na ito. may kakatuwa akong pakiramdam na may importanteng impormasyon akong hindi nalalaman. lahat 'yun iniisip ko habang paalis ako ng bahay nung biyernes na 'yun, last day ng training ko. ""andrew"", - dahan-dahan akong lumapit sa kanya. ""puwede ba mag-tanong?"" ""sure thing"", - sagot n'ya na may maaliwalas na ngiti sa kanyang mga labi. ""nagtataka lang ako, bakit wala akong nakikitang ibang support agents. i mean, 'di ba dapat merong at least lima pang tao para ma-cover 'yung six-day rotation cycle?"" ""kailangan mong tanungin ang manager mo tungkol d'yan. most likely naka-kalat sila sa iba pang branch sa syudad. normal lang naman 'yun sa ganoong kaso"", - sagot n'ya. pakiramdam ko tapos na kami sa diskusyon na 'yun matapos s'yang bumalik sa final tasks n'ya para sa linggong iyon. ""meron bang ibang agent na nag-trabaho dito liban sa akin?"" - pagpapatuloy ko, dahil ganun na lamang ang kagustuhan kong malaman ang iba pang detalye sa babaeng nag-fill out ng notebook na s'ya namang ginagamit ko sa buong linggong iyon. ""oo, may isang babae na humawak sa posisyon mo ng panandalian"", - ani ni andrew, habang naka-titig pa rin sa screen ng kanyang screen. pero napansin kong tumigil na s'ya sa pag-tatype o pag-galaw ng mouse. wari ko ay naka-titig lang s'ya sa iisang spot sa monitor n'ya. ""andrew"", - nag-salubong ang mga kilay ko. ""sino 'yung nag-trabaho malapit sa main working space na talagang nakaka-inis? maputla, medyo payat, maitim at kulot na buhok?"" - tanong ko, habang nagpapaikot ng daliri sa bandang ulunan ko para i-describe ang pagkaka-kulot ng nasabing lalake. ""ah... si michael"", - sagot nito, napansin nito ang pagiging iritable ng boses ko. ""may problema ba? ginugulo ka ba n'ya?"" ""hindi"" - sagot ko, pero sa isip-isip ko ay nagtatalo na ang emosyon at sarili ko. ""have a good weekend, andrew"" ""ikaw din"", - sagot nito, halata na may pagtataka sa boses nito habang papaalis ako. sa buong weekend na 'yun ay binabalik-balikan ko ang mga nangyari sa akin sa unang linggo ko. pakiramdam ko may hindi sinasabi si andrew sa akin na importante. wala namang rason para maging iretable s'ya nung nabanggit ko 'yung babaeng nag-trabaho bago ako. may nag-reklamo na kaya kay michael dati? pu-puwede kayang si j. espiritu? si michael ba ang dahilan ng survival guide sa notebook? bakit s'ya umalis? napaka-daming teorya ang bumagabag sa buong weekend ko. bago ko pa nalaman, oras na para bumalik sa trabaho. ito ang araw na talagang sobrang daming trabaho. kahapon ay lunes, ang unang regular day shift. mabilis lang dumaan ang nasabing araw, habang aligaga ako sa pag-sagot ng tawag, recording, sorting at assigning ng dose-dosenang customer complaints sa system namin. hindi sapat ang salitang nasanay na ako at pagkatapos ng araw na 'yun ay sobrang pagod at ubos na ako. saktong maglo-logout na ako, naka-tanggap na naman ako ng mensahe mula sa hindi kilalang number. ""ang sipag mo naman. hindi na ako makapag-hintay na mag night shift ka"" seryoso?! ito ang kauna-unahang mensahe na bumalot sa buong pagkatao ko ng takot. agad-agad kong ginala ang paningin ko kung nasa paligid ba si michael para kumprontahin ko s'ya sa pagse-send ng mensahe, pero kanina pa pala s'ya umalis. matapos kong pakalmahin ang sarili ko, umuwi na ako at sinusubukan kong hanapin si j. espiritu online. ang pinaka best bet ko noon ay sa linkedin, at doon nga ay sinusubukan kong galugarin ang buong listahan ng mga babae na may kinalaman sa proficient technologies na naka-lagay sa profile nila (halos kakaunti lang talaga sila). nung wala akong makita ay pumunta ako kay andrew at doon nga sa friend list n'ya ay sa wakas nakita ko na ang hinahanap ko. may babae na pangalan ay jennah espiritu at unemployed ang status. nag-send ako ng friend request na may mensahe na nag-papakilala at tinanong ko s'ya kung hinarass ba s'ya ng isa n'yang ka-trabaho. sa wakas, pakiramdam ko may patutunguhan na ako, natulog ako at inihanda ang sarili para sa bukas na event. naisip ko na baka may kakaibang mangyayari dahil sa pagbabago ng schedule nung natulog ako ng miyerkules. nag-check ako ng linkedin halos pagka-gising ko mga ala una. walang kahit anong sign kay jennah, kaya naman natulog ulit ako para makapag-handa sa night shift. medyo kinakabahan ako at excited at the same time kasi puwede ko ng mas malibot ang buong place of work ko intimately. dahil walang day crowd, malaya akong makaka-gala at ma-eenjoy ang cookies, dumura sa baso ni michael, kahit ano! may mga iilan pa ring mga nag-tatrabaho nung dumating ako para sa shift ko, pero hindi ko naman iyon pinansin at dahil sa nag-uumapaw na mga tawag at chats na aasikasuhin. makalipas ang dalawang oras, ang bugso ng mga tawag at chats pati mga tickets ay unti-unting bumagal hanggang tuluyan na nga itong tumigil ng sabay-sabay halos alas onse na ng gabi noon. sumandal ako sa kinauupuan ko at ginala-gala ang mga paningin sa aking workspace. wala ng tao noon sa office at least sa nakikita ko. naka-bukas ang lahat ng ilaw pero nung tinanggal ko ang headphones ko, may narinig akong mahinang jingling melody sa hindi kalayuan. para s'yang christmas carol, pero hirap akong tukuyin kong saan ito nangga-galing. wala namang dahilan para matakot ako sa pangyayari, pero pakiramdam ko ang mga nagtayuang balahibo sa mga kamay ko ay nagsilbing alarm. nang tumayo ako sa aking kinauupuan, nawala 'yung melody. well, naging paranoid na ako dati. minsan ko ng inisip na na may lalaking sumusunod sa akin isang gabi hanggang nilagpasan n'ya ako at nagtungo sa kalapit na tindahan sa 'di kalayuan. kahit mag-isa lang ako, lagi kong dino-double at triple check ang mga lock ng bahay bago matulog. aaminin ko na ang mga takot ko ay wala naman talagang basehan. mayroong naka-iwan ng headphones na konektado pa rin sa computer nito at naka-on ang music. o siguro may office party sa ibang kumpanya sa baba ng building. ang makarinig ng kanta ay nakaka-takot lamang sa mga kakatuwang horror movies, 'di ba? 'di ba?! para maka-siguro, hinalughog ko ang office para maka-siguro na mag-isa na nga lang ako. habang naglalakad sa gitna ng mga magkaka-dikit na desks, naisip ko kung gaano ako ka-swerte na mayroon akong sariling corner spot. hindi ko siguro kakayanin na mapalapit sa kahit sinong mga hindi kaaya-aya kong mga co-workers. matapos ko ma-check ang bawat rows ay dumiretcho ako sa front desk area at nagmamasid sa mga kagamitan ni andrew sa paghahanap ng clues. nung wala akong makitang clues ay bumalik ako sa main room ng pantry. unti-unti ng mas nagiging relaxed ang mga senses ko at tsaka ko lang napag-tanto na napasarap ata ang taste-testing ko sa mga cookies sa halip na mag-hanap ng mga kahina-hinalang mga bagay. kailangan ko ng tumigil sa kaka-kain ng cookies, pero dahil bumalik na naman ang kaninang tunog na naririnig ko, mas malakas s'ya ngayon. at the same time, ang work smartphone ko (na kinakailangan dala-dala namin kung aalis kami sa aming work station) tumunog at may mensahe mula sa hindi na namang kilalang number. so, nag-eenjoy ka ba sa cookies, ha? nanigas ang buong katawan ko habang prino-proseso ng utak ko ang mga pangyayari. siguro hindi talaga umalis ng office si michael at ngayon tinatakot ako. kinalikot ko ang tenga ko noon at nakinig ng maigi. walang kahit sino sa pantry as least sa nakikita at naririnig ko. tsaka, kung si michael ay nasa main workspace, hindi naman ganun kahirap na hulaan o sabihin na kumakain ako ng cookies. habang dahan-dahan akong humihinga, hindi ko muna pinansin ang tunog at nakinig ako ng maigi kung may iba pa akong tunog na maririnig. wala. dahan-dahan, naglakad ako sa may pantry drawers at doon may nakita akong malaking kutsilyo. alam ko bang gumamit ng kutsilyo? hindi. kaya ko kayang paalisin kung sino man ang unarmed na kalaban? syempre. papunta na sana ako pabalik sa aking work station ng biglang may tawag na pumasok mula sa work phone. ipinosisyon ko ang sarili ko ng kumportable sa pader ng pantry, kutsilyo sa kanang kamay, cell phone sa kabila, bago pa ako maka-sagot with the standard customer support greeting. nag static na sa kabilang linya at iba pang ingay sunod ang tuluyang pagka-putol ng linya at katahimikan. nung tinignan ko ang cell phone, nakita kong naka-patay na ito. sinubukan kong buksan ulit ito, pero hindi na ito gumagana. ok, ngayon kailangan ko ng bumalik sa computer ko in case na may pumasok pang mga tawag. naalala ko bigla ang isa sa mga guide na galing kay jennah habang isinusuksok ko ang walang kwentang cell phone sa bulsa ko. - laging mag-open ng skype na naka-ready sa emergency in case na hindi gumana ang mobile services. nangyari rin kaya 'to sa kanya? ang mga instructions sa notebook ay unti-unti ng nagkaroon ng kahulugan, at minumura ko ang sarili ko dahil sa pagiging tanga. sa oras na lumabas ang mga salita sa bibig ko ay may isa na namang mensahe ang dumating sa cell phone. kinuha ko iyon at sinubukang i-unlock, pero 'yung regular home screen ay hindi lumalabas. ang lumabas lang ay isang white screen na may maikling text. putang ina. ang mga babae dapat hindi ginagamit ng ganung mga uri ng salita. matapos kong mabasa 'yun ay nawala na ito sa screen at may panibagong text ang lumabas. bakit hindi ka lumabas at makipag-laro? huwag mo ng isiping bitbitin pa 'yang kutsilyong hawak mo. wala ring magagawa 'yan sa hawak kong baril. tinapon ko ang cell phone ko sa lapag at agad-agad ay nagtungo ako sa aking computer. ang tunog ay mas lalong lumakas habang papalapit ako sa aking lamesa, doon ay nakita kong may isang baboy na stuffed toy. may fabric button ito sa bandang paanan at music note na kasama. dito nagmumula ang tunog at nagpapatunay lamang na hindi ako mag-isa at may kung sino akong kasama. ang malala pa, pinapanood nila ang bawat galaw ko at sinusubukang takutin gamit ang mga laruang pambata. unti-unti ng dumadaloy ang pagpapanic sa aking buong katawan at naghahanda na sa fight or flight scenario. huminga ako ng malalim, sinusubukan kong pakalmahin ang buong katawan ko. so far wala pa naman akong naririnig ng kahit anong palatandaan na may ibang tao sa loob ng office. may mga background noises galing sa syudad sa labas at ang mga ingay mula sa naka-limutang patayin na computer ng isang employee. kung sino man ang gumagawa nito sa akin, kailangan kong malaman ang kanilang eksaktong lokasyon para maplano ko ng maayos ang pag-takas ko. isa pa, kailangan kong maka-kuha ng tulong sa lalong mas madaling panahon. habang iginigilid ko ang laruan ay umupo na ako sa aking upuan at pinull-up ang skype for business application. mabilis akong nag-dial ng 911, habang naka-loudspeaker ang telepono. tumunog na nga ang dial tone at agad-agad ay may live operator na sa kabilang linya. ibibigay ko na sana ang mga hindi kanais-nais na pangyayari sa akin ng mga oras na iyon ng may biglang humawak sa bukong-bukong ko mula sa ilalim ng lamesa. halos maubos ang buong lakas ko sa pagsigaw habang nagpu-pumiglas ang mga paa at mabilis na tumakbo sa abot ng aking makakaya sa bilis na hindi ko akaling kaya ko. may narinig akong kung anong kumusyon sa aking likuran habang tumakbo, kasunod ng isang malakas ng putok, na inisip ko na lamang na galing sa kung ano o sino man ang humahabol sa akin. bago ko pa malaman ay halos nasa ground floor na ako papunta sa pinto lagpas sa gwardiya na halatang nagulat sa mga nangyayari. ang malamig na hangin ay mabilis na pumasok sa manipis kong sweater habang papalapit ako sa isang malapit na pedestrian para humingi ng tulong. tumawag sila ng 911 at ang mga pulis ay agad namang dumating wala pang sampung minuto. habang naghihintay ako kasama ang gwardiya para sa kanilang pag-dating, hindi maalis sa isip ko ang sinulat ni jennah na warning, at kung gaano ako ka-tanga para ipagsa walang bahala ang mga ito. - i-check ang ang bawat aisle, meeting room. huwag kalimutang i-check ang ilalim ng lamesa, balkonahe, kitchen tables at kahit likod ng cooler. agad-agad namang sinulat ng pulis ang mga nangyari sa akin at iniwan ako kasama ang isang pulis officer, umakyat s'ya para i-check ang office. wala namang naka-labas-masok sa building mula nung tumakbo ako palabas, kaya malaki ang posibilidad na naroroon pa rin ang salarin at nagtatago sa loob. sa pag-iisip ay halos bumaliktad ang buong sikmura ko at mas lalo akong lumapit sa may armas kong kasama. maya-maya pa matapos kaming iwanan ng mga pulis, ang kasama kong pulis ay nag-radyo at isa-isa may mga boses na nagpapa-palit-palit sa radyo na humingi ng backup at nga mga codes na hindi ko maintindihan. mabilis na nag-escalate ang mga sumunod na pangyayari. imbis na pauwi ay dinala nila ako sa police station at doon ay nanatili ako sa isang interrogation room ng halos 2 oras bago pa sa wakas may dalawang pulis officer ang kumausap sa akin. pagod na ako noon, miserable ang kalagayan at higit sa lahat litong-lito sa kung papaano naganap ang mga pangyayari. gusto ko ng umuwi pero nanatili pa ako ng ilang oras para i-kuwento ang mga pangyayari sa dalawang pulis officer. 'ahh... meron kang kutsilyong hawak habang tumakbo ka galing sa pantry papunta sa lamesa mo? sigurado ka ba?' tanong ng isang nakaka-tandang officer na nagpakilala bilang senior investigator manlapig. 'ah. ah... oo.' pautal-utal kong sagot sa kanya. 'naniniwala akong meron. nag-papanic na ako noon, kaya mahirap sabihin. tapos may baboy na stuffed toy, ' sabi ko, habang tila baga'y nawawalan ako ng abilidad na mag-isip ng tama. 'at naniniwala ka na ang taong humaharass sa'yo ay si michael villareal?' sabi ng isa pang officer, hindi ko maalala 'yung pangalan n'ya. wala s'yang badge. 'hindi ko alam buong pangalan n'ya, pero wala na akong ibang kilala na iba pang responsable.' 'at sa huling pagkakataon, just for the record, anong nangyari matapos mong mag-dial ng 911?' tanong ni manlapig sa ika-apat na pagkakataon sa gabing 'yun. 'may kung sino ang humawak sa binti ko. bukong-bukong, actually. nangyari 'yun bago pa ako magkaroon ng pagkakataong ipaliwanag ang sitwasyon sa operator. nagsusumigaw at piglas ang mga paa ko tapos tumakbo hanggang may makita akong tao sa labas na pina-tawag ako sa 911 para sa tulong.' sagot ko, habang pagod na pagod sa paulit-ulit at paikot-ikot na pagtatanong. 'si michael villareal ay natagpuang patay sa hindi kalayuan ng iyong lamesa nung pumunta ang officer namin sa pinang-yarihan ng insidente. nakita mo ba ang kanyang katawan nung tumakbo ka palabas ng office?' tanong ng isang officer. halos malaglag ang panga ko sa mga narinig ko at tumitig sa dalawang pulis habang balisa at nanginginig sa takot. 'hi.. hi.. hindi,' pabulong akong nag-salita, 'hindi ko maintindihan,' 'sinaksak s'ya hanggang sa mamatay gamit ang malaking kutsilyo. ang katawan n'ya ay balot ng dalawampu't-tatlong saksak,' paliwanag ni manlapig. 'at nakita namin ang kutsilyo ay nakabaon sa bibig nito, dahilan para dumikit ito sa sahig diretcho sa lalamunan,' 'may rason kami para pagsuspetyahan na ito rin ang sinasabi mong kutsilyo,' dagdag pa ng pangalawang officer. nakatitig ako sa dalawang pulis officer ng tahimik, hirap akong intindihin ang mga pangyayari lalo na't ang utak ko ay halos mawala na sa ulirat. 'ang mga sinabi mo ay nagpapatunay lamang sa mga natagpuaan namin sa cell phone ni michael villareal. nalaman namin na may roon siyang hacking apps,' pagpapatuloy ng senior officer. 'natagpuan din naman ang ilan mo pang mga hubong larawan at ang mga mensahe na iyong nabanggit. mayroon s'yang baril at nakita rin naman ang basyo ng bala nung binaril ka n'ya habang papatakas ka.' 'ang hindi namin maintindihan ay kung papaano s'ya namatay.' dagdag pa ng pangalawang officer, halatang hindi s'ya naniniwala sa aking reaksyon. 'ok lang kung napatay mo s'ya dahil sa self-defense, aya. may balak s'yang masama sa'yo.' 'hindi,' pautal-utal kong sagot. 'pangako, wala akong ideya... oh, oh my god.' naiyak na ako dahil sa mga nangyayari. 'ibig kong sabihin, nung nakaraang buwan lang may nag-report sa kanya galing sa isa n'yang co-worker,' sabi ni manlapig. 'jennah,' bulong ko. 'kilala mo si miss espiritu?' tanong ng pangalawang officer, at ng suspetya sa kanyang mga mats. 'hindi,' ako ang pumalit sa lamesa n'ya at nakuha ko ang notebook n'ya. dapat sinabi ko na 'to kanina pa. anong sabi sa report? doon nga ay nagtitigan ang dalawang pulis at maka-lipas ang ilang sandali ay inilatag at ipinaliwanag ni manlapig ang mga hindi magandang nangyari kay jennah na halos mangyari na sa akin. si jennah espiritu ay dumiretcho sa pinaka-malapit na hospital mula sa kanyang unang night shift tatlong buwan na ang nakakaraan. sobrang bugbog ng katawan n'ya at sugatan, at gustong mag-file ng anonymous rape kit. ang natanong damage n'ya sa kanyang puwerta ay sobrang severe na kinailangan n'yang sumailalim sa operasyon at magpatahi. nag-file s'ya ng police report makalipas ang dalawang buwan matapos s'yang hindi pumasa sa probationary period sa inyong kumpanya, ng nawala s'ya sa trabaho (ang nagiisang paraan para mabayaran ang kanyang utang sa hospital). ang nangyari ay ang kanyang aligasyon kontra kay michael villareal, na gumastos s'ya ng malaki sama mo pa ang hindi mabilang na kanyang mga co-workers na kumontra sa kanya laban sa magalang at kaaya-ayang katangian ni michael. 'pero kahapon lang ay iniurong na n'ya lahat ng mga isinampa n'yang kaso kay michael,' sabi ng walang badge na pulis. 'kasalukuyan naming inaalam ang kinaroroonan ni espiritu para ma-interview namin s'ya. sigurado ako na ngayon malinaw na kung bakit may suspetya kami sa iyo bilang nakikilala mo espiritu.' nagpatuloy ang mga tanong ng dalawang pulis hanggang may isang lalaki na nag-abot sa kanya ng isang sobre. natukoy na ng forensics ang fingerprint na nakita sa kutsilyo at ang blood-spatter patterns. kinailangan ko ring mag-submit ng dna samples para maka-tulong sa imbestigasyon at sa wakas ay pina-uwi na nila ako. sa bahay, dahil sa sobrang pagod, hindi ako maka-tulog. wala akong gamit na naiuwi. bag, cell phone at kahit ang jacket ko ay kinailangan i-submit bilang ebidensya. kaya naman napilitan akong gamitin ang luma kong laptop, umaasa na malibang sa internet. ang browser ko ay naka-login pa rin sa linkedin account ko mula sa nakaraang login, at nirefreshed ko ang page bilang naka-sanayan. isang maliit na red icon ang lumitaw na mayroon akong bagong mensahe. jennah. nagre-reply na s'ya sa akin. don't worry, sis. i took care of it. ❤️",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/t77k69/tagalized_story/,5 03 2022
Life Without A Gallbladder,"sa mga natanggalan or posibleng tanggalan ng gallbladder, let me share my journey. in 2020 to mid-2021 i weighed around 110kg (230lb roughly). last week of october 2022: i felt funny after waking up. kulay tsaa/cobra energy drink yung pee ko, and my poops was bubbly and watery. akala ko wala lang. i returned to my normal routine which is eat breakfast > exercise > rest > eat snack > play video games > log in to work > sleep. my stomach felt a little pain but hindi naman sobrang sakit. i didn't mind if pero i knew something was wrong with me. november 1st to 4th 2022: my brother asked me kung may hepatitis ako. lo and behold, looking at the mirror mukha akong character sa the simpsons. we drank coffee at home first and we headed to the hospital. after a series of tests, the doctors saw i had a gallstone blockage in my common bile duct and my gallbladder has minor swelling. i had to undergo two procedures: ercp (endoscopy) and laparoscopic cholecystectomy aka lap chole. later that day i underwent ercp and the following day i had my gallbladder removed. the next day i was discharged of the hospital with flying colors. one of the causes of this was naipon yung mga mamantikang pagkain that i ate back then, also the bile solidified in the gallbladder because of my sudden halt of eating such fatty food so the bile had no reason to leave the gallbladder and they turned into stones. a stent was put in my common bile duct to widen bile passage to my intestines. my surgeon and gastro doctor told me to lessen my intake of fatty and salty foods, pasalamat daw ako my cholesterol levels, blood sugar, and blood pressure are all normal. november 1st half: was adviced by my surgeon to go into a low-salt and low fat diet. felt minor heartburns while drinking coffee so i can only consume half a sachet of a 3-in-1 instant coffee. i weighed around 84kg this time (before operation i was 92kg). a day after discharge i can already walk to the store to buy stuff. 3 days later i'm able to drive and go to the grocery store but had to ask help from my nephew to carry the stuff from the car to the kitchen kasi bawal pa magbuhat ng mabigat. laughing, breathing deeply, and yawning hurt the abdominal area. took some proton inhibitors and antacids to teach my digestive system how to process food without the gallbladder. november 2nd half: it's been a month without drinking. was invited to a childhood friend's wedding. vikings ginanap. konti konti lang din ang kinain. i cannot consume alcohol yet so i just had juice and water while my friends drank tons of beer. this is also where i narrowed down what i can and can't eat. hindi naman sa mamamatay ako or something, but the wrong stuff can trigger your stomach and can make you poop. for example lots of oily food and drinking coffee without eating beforehand. softdrinks doesn't have much of an effect. december 1st half: i drank my first glass of alcohol for the first time after a month (kulafu with iced tea mixed with water and ice). i didn't feel any effect on my stomach besides getting tipsy. i discovered that i still had my somewhat strong alcohol tolerance, but this time ayoko na sagarin yung kalasingan ko like i did in the olden days of my prime. i also tried eating mini stop fried chicken which i was dying to eat again, it was good but then i had to go to the bathroom 15 minutes later. my diet now primarily consists of sinabawang isda/chicken and vegetables, 1 cup of rice. december 2nd half: this is the challenging part since it was the holidays. saktong kain at inom lang and as much as possible, space out drinking sessions a day or two apart. may mga friends din kasi na umuwi from overseas and nakakahiya naman tanggihan. pacing lang din. ended the year grateful that i got over my lap chole. january (present): right now i still play around 85-87kg because i like to drink a lot of water everyday. ngayon i'm trying to cleanse up all that unhealthy shit during the holidays. i'm feeling good, feeling light, feeling healthy, and alive. i still eat bad shit and drink alcohol every now and then, but it's all in moderation now kumbaga ""matikman lang"". life is good. i still continue walking my dog for 30m-1hr every day so she can poop and pee outside, as well as get exercise for both of us. i still have an upcoming ercp procedure to remove the said stent from my common bile duct. but all in all again, i feel good. cheers to a healthier 2023! my current meals per day: * oatmeal with milk, banana, and peanut butter / tuna-skyflakes with a lightly fried egg * boiled saba / kamote / kamoteng ube * sinabawang isda / chicken with tons of veggies, 1 cup of rice mixed with vegetables. stay healthy, people! if there are any doctors in the house feel free to contribute.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/10dixq3/life_without_a_gallbladder/,16 01 2023
Moving out/running away from my emotionally abusive father who was away for 10 years,"tl;dr: emotionally abusive ofw father recently came home after 10 years and we had a huge fight which made me too uncomfortable too stay in this house. already planned to move out even before he came home but he might think i'm moving out because of him (tho it's also true). i don't know how to tell him that i'm moving out knowing his tendencies hello, i’m 23 years old and my father was an ofw for 10 years. i won't go into details sa history ng pagiging emotionally abusive/manipulative niya before and during the time na nasa abroad siya since that would be too long considering na mahaba din yung story. anyways, umuwi siya last month and since di sila okay ng mother ko, umalis na yung mother ko sa bahay so natira kami ng kuya ko. nung first two days ang bait niya so naisip ko parang ang judgemental ko na inisip ko mga masasamang bagay sa kanya dati but then i was immediately proved wrong. on the second night pumasok siya sa kwarto ko nang lasing at 1 am and patulog na ako since may work pa the next day. verbatimly sabi niya “lasing tatay mo” and then proceed to ask some questions, catching up ganun and at the same time ilang beses niya inuulit na na tabi daw kami matulog and despite me saying no multiple times, lumapit pa rin siya at tumabi. at first wala akong ginawa since tatabi lang naman but then sumiksik siya nang sumiksik and that’s when i got uncomfortable so tumayo ako at lumabas ng kwarto para sana uminom ng tubig pero sumunod siya sa baba so tumakbo ako pabalik ng kwarto and nilock yung pinto. he kept on knocking and calling for my name pero ang sagot ko lang ay “matulog ka na pa bukas na tayo mag usap pag di ka na lasing” but of course he kept on denying na lasing siya. eventually he said “sisirain ko ‘tong pinto mo” and started banging on the door loudly tapos may ginagawa pa siyang di ko alam sa doorknob so i started shouting saying na ipapabarangay ko siya pag di siya tumigil but he didn’t stop and confidently said “oh sige” until he finally opened the door without a key. that alone was scary plus may expression pa sa mukha niya na di ko maexplain basta nakakatakot so tumakbo ako malapit sa kwarto ng kuya ko just in case na may gawin siya. sumunod siya then he started his manipulative sad boi session saying na 10 years siya nagsakripisyo para samin tapos ganun lang turing ko sa kanya, how he always wanted to go to college dati pero hindi kaya ng parents niya so nag ofw siya para hindi namin maexperience yun. hindi daw siya nanunumbat but kept on saying na hindi ako makakapag aral sa ganitong school kung di dahil sa kanya which is factually wrong since yung nanay ko yung nababaon sa utang para lang makabayad sa tuition namin dahil bihira siya magpadala. sinisigawan niya ko the whole time habang dinuduro duro ako. nakipag sigawan din ako asking questioning his actions that night then i made mention of the other traumatizing things he did and how he never realized that he's wrong but he kept on mentioning the 10 years/gusto niya magcollege. i ended it by saying na hindi ko naman ginusto mabuhay bakit siya nag anak tapos isusumbat niya lang lahat. days after that he started acting nice again cooking my favorite foods, other acts of service, etc but there was no apology, he’s acting like nothing happened and that we’re ok. i mean gets naman na ganun yung karamihan ng parents but the experience was not the same for me. until now i’m still anxious whenever we’re in the same room so i’m trying my best para umiwas magtatanong nga lang kung kumain na ako kumakabog na dibdib ko. di siya kumakatok sa pinto bago pumasok so iniiwan ko nalang na bukas para marinig ko and maready ko sarili ko pag papasok siya. and lastly tuwing iinom siya (around 3 times a week) kailangan ko i-barricade yung pinto sa takot. basta this home is no longer a safe place for me and gusto ko na lumipat plus kami rin naman ng kuya ko yung nagbabayad sa lahat ng gastusin. may nakita na akong lilipatan na malapit dun sa area kung saan nagsstay nanay ko tho dito pa rin sa barangay yung place. pinapalipat na ko next week and i don't know kung pano ako magpapaalam without any drama knowing na may sadboi tendencies nga yung tatay ko. tbh plan ko na talaga lumipat ng bahay by the end of the year bago pa umuwi yung tatay ko, baka kasi isipin niya na lilipat ako ng bahay dahil sa kanya tho it's true, hindi naman yun yung sole reason. i don't know what reactions i will get since the last time na nagpost ako dito about him natawag akong ""entitled brat"" for not appreciating his sacrifice despite showing evidence of him being an asshole but i just wanted to share my experience and maybe get some advice on how to tell him that i'm moving out",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/r6d7on/moving_outrunning_away_from_my_emotionally/,1 12 2021

My proposal is penalized individuals na lumabas na meron symptoms as a priority vs unvaccinated,"nanoticed ko na our government is now starting to punish individuals who are unvaccinated pero hindi ba ang unvaccinated ang dehado? they have the biggest risk right now if they go out, giving them more chances to get severe case of covid. pero tayong vaccinated, less chances of severe type of covid. not zero chance of covid. and everyone is still a potential carrier of the disease. pero i can see a lot of people working right now sa labas na may sipon at ubo. eto ung nakakaspread ng sakit pero no one is telling them sa bahay po muna kayo magquarantine kasi baka covid yan at nakakahawa. hindi ba mas dapat ipriority ito vs unvaccinated. or do a proper marketing sa pinas, if may sipon or ubo or trankaso, ok lang na di muna pumasok or wag ka na lumabas muna. ang sipon at ubo at pedeng makahawa ng iba, blah blah. alam ko turo ng mga magulang or prof natin dati, ubo sipon lang yan, kung sila nga mamatay na kayod parin para lang mabuhay or pumasok sa school etc. pero it's not the mentality na you are weak for not working or going to school but because you can be a carrier that can infect more people. edit: best explanation why we are encouraging vaccination to the unvax: https://www.reddit.com/r/philippines/comments/s3lvv3/my_proposal_is_penalized_individuals_na_lumabas/hslons9/ why providing sick leave is important and the current situation sa country natin why di mabigyan basta basta: https://www.reddit.com/r/philippines/comments/s3lvv3/my_proposal_is_penalized_individuals_na_lumabas/hsloul0/ also i want to clarify that i didn't post this to discourage people from getting vaccinated. get vaccinated if hindi ka pa vaccinated. this will prevent you from getting too sick or die from covid. magastos magkasakit. but the increase in numbers in covid right now isn't caused by the unvaccinated people but people who go out with symptoms (whether vaccinated or not vaccinated sila). we started to become too lenient and confident na basta bakunado ok na. it takes everyone to be considerate to not go out or not go to work physically if you are sick or has symptoms to prevent possible transmission of any type of viruses (whether if it's the regular flu or covid). yun ang gusto ko ipoint out dito.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/s3lvv3/my_proposal_is_penalized_individuals_na_lumabas/,14 01 2022

Is it a Good Business Idea?,so here it is. meron kasi akong nadadaanan na pandesalan on my way home from work. mga 5am sila nagsisimulang magtinda and mga 9am or 10am sarado na dahil ubos na ang pandesal. masarap talaga sya lalo na ung original pati ung may pahid ng margarin pag bagong luto. so it's 8km from our village at tuwing umaga ay may naglalako ng pandesal for 3 pesos na medyo malaki nmn at tingin ko mas better ung nadadaanan ko na pandesal kesa dun sa naglalako sa amin. ang balak ko gawin ay mag pa free taste muna sa bawat bahay at after that kung may mga gustong omorder mag papapre-order ako everyday for 3 pesos each so may tubo akong 1 peso per pandesal. i know it's not sustainable dahil parang magresell lang ako but i just want to try this as this is a low risk low reward idea since pre orders nga sya. help guys hehe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/10fb6l3/is_it_a_good_business_idea/,18 01 2023
Nag jogging ako at namigay ng Leni-Kiko merch sa mga tricyle driver at kwento ko kung ano nangyari,"wala na akong chance maka sama sa h2h dahil sa personal commitments so i dedicated my jogging to campaign effort. i decided my target group would be the tricycle station malapit sa amin, marami kasing nagparinig sa akin doon noong naka leni shirt ako. **good/neutral experience:** nagmeryenda ako ng pansit sa tindahan doon tapos yung dalawang nakasabay na kumain interested kung bakit ako nangangampanya. nagtawag sila ng ibang driver na nahihiyang lumapit para makakuha ng merch (face masks). since highschool kasi ako sumasakay ako sa station nakilala nila ako. mga remarks: - ang sipag mo naman - idol mo talaga si leni - kaninong grupa ka? (kasi i learned may iba nang volunteers na pumunta doon dati) - saan saan ka na nakapunta? (rallies) emphasis on ""idol"" when speaking about leni. they are in a mindset i'm doing this because i idolize a person. tapos curious sila aa merch ko sabi ko binili ko walang bayad ginagawa ko kampanya lang. sabi ko sa pasay lang ako umattend (so it's clear to them i'm not a rally hopper). i also said wala akong partida or grupo, sarili ko lang. i managed to steer the conversation to sumilao farmers. i told them i used to be apathetic/walang pake kung sinong pangulo dati (partly true, i was undecided until march just not bbm), tapos nagbago isip ko kasi sa story ng farmers. **not so good experience** one driver ask my age, if i'm married, and if i have a manliligaw then when he learned i'm single he's like ""sabi na nga"". i don't entirely consider this negative in a sense ganito talaga matatanda that they couldn't comprehend why some women marry late, pero i'm 80% sure they wouldn't ask the same question to a man. tapos yung mga nag ubos ng merch ko, paglayo nila nang-aasar ng ""wala kaming paki sa pangulo mo"" nq parinig saka i can overhear na ""bayad na 300 pesos umattend sa rally ni leni,"" at ""next week pag natalo kakabahan lahat yan."" when i walked near them they were suddenly silent. puro sila parinig pag malayo ako but they couldn't say it to my face. i chose not to engage na since i'm a lone woman saka it's like their baiting me with pang-aasar. **all in all** may iilang nakinig, kahit sexist pakikitungo sa akin, at least narinig nila yung kwento ng sumilao farmers. abonado merch, abonado oras, no regrets. hindi to for leni, para sa prinsipyo.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/uezuju/nag_jogging_ako_at_namigay_ng_lenikiko_merch_sa/,30 04 2022

ANNOYING THINGS RELIGIOUS PEOPLE/GROUPS DO. (TLDR if you're not interested),"i'm atheist and naturally, i find religion pointless and a load of self-indulgent egotistical nonsense but i mostly keep it to myself unless otherwise provoked. i don't go out into the streets and shove atheism down other people's throats - and for the record bwiset din ako sa mga atheists na sobrang outspoken na akala mo ikamamatay nila kapag di nila napatunayan na walang mga diyos. i don't give two fucks if friends and fam alike subscribe to a religion that promotes and encourages bigotry, homophobia, etc. as long as they don't break the law or interfere with my life so i won't go there. instead, i'll focus on the things that they do na nakakaabala sa mga nakapaligid sa kanila (in particular order). and don't even get me started dun sa mga nageendorse ng mga kandidato kapag eleksyon tapos may drama pang laying of the hands sa ulo habang nakapikit yung mga hudas na pulitiko. **1. jehovah's witnesses** ***-*** *the most annoying of the lot. the fact that they turn up during the most inconvenient hours on weekends (esp. while you're busy doing housework) makes me even want to smash them on the head with a really heavy leatherbound bible with decorative brass edges and an enormous medallion embossed in the center. afaik sila rin ang dahilan kung bakit nag-ooverflow ang basurahan ko dahil sa mga nyetang flyers na pinagsisisingit nila sa mga gilid-gilid ng gate. and lastly, kung ubos na ang slots para sa mga maliligtas ay makakapasok sa langit e bakit pa sila nag-eeffort magkayag ng mga bagong miyembro? saan mapupunta yung mga new recruits? house seats, fifth row center in the great theater in the sky? jesus wept.* **2. born again christians** (and pretty much any other christian denomination) *- at least they don't go knocking on people's doors on weekends but they have the resilience of a cockroach. they keep harping on and on and on about ""the lord"" and they'll drag you to join them na magsimba sa church nila if they could. tila di ata sila makabuo ng isang sentence na hindi nasisingit yung phrase na ""si/ni/kay lord"" to the point na naiirita nako every time na marinig ko na banggitin nila yang ""si lord"" nila. i find that rude kase in my case, those people were fully aware na atheist ako. lalo na kapag humirit na sila ng ""diba kapag may napanood kang magandang movie ang tendency mo is ikuwento mo?"" i told them na okay given that's the case, kaya lang kapag paulit ulit mo nang ineendorse yang lecheng movie na yan pero hanggang ngayon hindi parin interesado yung kausap mo it's time to give it a rest na diba? and guess what? not everyone fucking digs harry potter, game of thrones, lord of the rings, etc. and that's perfectly fine. you don't have to get so worked up about it.* **3. roman catholics** *- my major beef with this religion i grew up with is when the powers-that-be interfere with politics. although naiintindihan ko kse may vested interest yung mga higher-ups sa pagpapatakbo ng bansa. roman catholicism is not the most financially-literate religious group in the world for nothing. not to mention we practice catholicism of the most outdated and antiquated sort dito kaya ayun, naging hindrance kase may mga progressive laws sa western world na dapat noon pa naipatupad dito (e.g. abortion, divorce, etc.) kaya lang hinahadlangan ng mga powerful at nagtatabaang mga bishops. unfortunately, it appears secularization is nothing but a pipe dream dito sa pilipinas.* **4. iglesia ni cristo** *- eto pa isa pa to. in due time magdedemand narin to ng mga sangkatutak na holidays na dapat irecognize ng buong sambayanan. but at least they stick to their own kind kaya i find them tolerable most of the time naman. not sure kung may nagbabahay-bahay sa kanila kase wala pa naman akong naencounter. pero once na magsimulang magdemand to na ipagbawal ang mga kung anu-anong bagay-bagay dahil against sa belief system nila ay p\*t\*n\*i\*a there will be blood!* **5. mormons (church of jesus of latter-day saints)** *- paminsan minsan may naeencounter ako nito pero kahit nagbabahay-bahay din sila so far wala namang nagpainit ng ulo ko. i just told them politely i'm an atheist and i don't (and won't ever) subscribe to any organized religion and that's it, they just said their goodbyes sans fanfare. nakakaaliw pa nga yung mga kano na sobrang fluent magtagalog e. minsan nga kino-coach ko pa e kse may mga ginagamit silang tagalog words na sobrang quaint na at baka mapagtawanan pa sila.* **6. muslims** *- the ones i find the most tolerable. they stick to their own kind like all the time. and contrary to popular belief, they're mostly peaceful and they tend to leave others well alone as long as you don't try to offend them on purpose. may mga muslim friends nga ako nung college na kaharap ko pa kpg kumakain ako ng barbecue wala lang sa kanila dedma lang and di namin dinidiscuss it in the first place. they rarely engage in pointless religious debates with non-muslims. yung suki ko nga dati nung uso pa ang pirated dvds nagbebenta pa ng mga religious movies kpg malapit na ang holy week e. as an animal rights advocate i'm not in favor of some jalal practices though...* the rest tulad ng mga buddhists, hindus at jewish bihira ako maka-encounter ng mga members nila kaya wala ako ma-criticize sa mga gawain nila. nung bata ako may naalala pa nga akong grupo ng mga hindus na once in a while nagpaparada sa kalsada tapos namimigay ng popcorn na nakabalot sa papel de hapon kaya may extra brownie points pa sila sakin. minsan nga 2 pa ang nahihingi ko e. :p &#x200b; end of rant.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/xr4ir5/annoying_things_religious_peoplegroups_do_tldr_if/,29 09 2022
Nakakapagod Mabuhay,"hello. last year, my mom was diagnosed with cancer. simula nung mag start yung treatment nawalan kami ng stable income kasi walang trabaho si mama at si papa dahil sya ang laging kasama ni mama sa pagpunta sa hospital. i struggled sa pag aaral halos araw-araw madaling araw na ako natutulog kasi need ko gumawa ng mga problem sets, and plates. fortunately, naka survive ako ng 1st year as a president's lister so i'm really grateful kasi kinaya ko. ngayon update lang kay mama, she was diagnosed with cervical cancer stage 3b and nag start na sya mag treatment pero nahihirapan yung katawan nya mag keep up sa mga gamot kaya sobra yung pinayat nya and yung lab nya ngayon is bagsak kaya need nya magpasalin ng dugo. sobrang hirap nung process sa pagsalin ng dugo kasi yung mga kamag-anak namin tinalikuran kami walang willing tumulong sa amin kaya hirap na hirap kami maghanap ng pera. grabe lang kasi noon kapag may kailangan sila, isang sabi lang nagbibigay agad ng tulong sila mama pero ngayon na kami yung may kailangan ni hindi man lang nila makamusta si mama. one time nga nung nanghingi kami ng dugo gusto nila pabayaran, alam ko naman na wala ng libre ngayon pero kasi kamag-anak mo na yun bakit ayaw mo tulungan. naubos na yung ipon ni mama at papa pambili ng gamot walang wala na kami. ako umaasa ako sa scholarship para mag aral yung kalahati pa nung nakukuha ko sa scholarship pinambabayad namin sa bahay. naiinggit ako sa ibang students na sinusuportahan ng magulang yung tipong walang iisipin kung hindi mag-aral. sobrang napapagod na talaga ako lalo na naririnig ko minsan si papa na nagsasabi na gusto na daw nya mawala kasi napapagod na sya tapos maririnig ko na umiiyak si mama kasi sobrang sakit daw ng katawan nya. yung philhealth hindi kami makakuha kasi hindi naghulog sila mama noon. sobrang nakakapagod. if anyone wants to help kahit piso pandagdag lang pambili sa gamot ni mama, please message me. ayoko po manghingi pero kasi walang wala na kami. hindi ko na alam gagawin ko. pagod na pagod na po ako. update: ngayon lang po ako nakapag online ulit. kauuwi ko lang po galing school. nagpunta po si papa kanina sa emergency para kumuha ng dugo pero ubos na raw po yung dugo kaya maghahanap pa lang po kami sa ibang hospital. bukas rin po pupunta sila mama sa pgh kasi nahihirapan po si mama kumain ng solid foods kaya need nya magpa dextrose. magpapa confine po sila ng mga ilang araw para po medyo maging maayos pakiramdam ni mama para matuloy ang radiation and chemo nya.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/17aejfi/nakakapagod_mabuhay/,18 10 2023
Animal Shelters and Online 'Limos',"naglipana na ang mga iba't ibang animal shelters online, and i think it's a good thing since it's a worthy cause. they post pictures of their beloved rescues, may it be dogs or cats. some even make memes out of them, but sometimes i can't help but notice that some are using them to their advantage. magpopost sila ng picture ng rescue nila na mukhang nakakakaawa tas magcacaption na ""mag-donate na kayo, ubos na yung cat food ko - rescue."" pwede rin yung picture kung saan kita halos lahat na rescues na pinapakain tas ang caption ""ito na ang huling araw na may pagkain sila, baka pwede kayo magdonate para makabili at makakain sila bukas."" or simply, ""wala nang pagkain ang mga rescues namin, pwede kayo magdonate ng ₱200 para sa isang can ng cat food or pwede niyo rin ipadala sa aming bahay (insert address)."" para bagang responsibilidad ng kanilang followers or donators na buhayin yung mga rescues nila. i get it, mahal magpakain at bumuhay ng mga rescues, pero sana magrescue lang sila hangga't sa makakaya ng kanilang bulsa. paano na laamang kung bumaba ang engagements at donations nila to the point na hindi na sustainable yung pagpapatakbo ng shelter? hindi rin imposible na magsara yung shelter at yung mga rescues nila ay mapunta lang sa city pound to be killed. buti man lang kung maraming nagaadopt eh kakaunti na nga lang tas dadagdagan pa nila yung mga rescues para makapaglimos na naman sila ulit sa mga followers nila. hindi ba animal cruelty rin yung paggamit sa kanila para magkaroon ng awa 'effect' sa mga followers nila and minsan 'lowkey' guilt-tripping para magdonate sa mga rescues nila? i'm not saying na bawal na mag-solicit ng donations yung mga shelters kaso yung iba hindi na rin sumasapat yung donations bukod doon sa nilalabas na pera ng mga rescuers. yung ibang shelters nga personal account nila ang ginagamit para sa mga donations kaya mahirap din magkaroon ng transparency and accountability kasi sa bank secrecy laws ng ating bansa, in contrast, sa mga ngo (e.g. paws) or foundations na may sariling bank account nila. hindi ko naman sinasabi na lahat sila ay ill-intentioned but i think every donator intends to know if their donations are really going to the rescues and hindi sila naneneglect because it's going to rescuers instead. what's your take on this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/yo4exw/animal_shelters_and_online_limos/,6 11 2022

DepEd?,"mga bata ngayon takot magkasakit simply because may mga mamimiss silang activities, and i know some people na pumapasok parin even though masama pakiramdam nila. actually sa classroom namin ang dami na nagkakahawaan pero pinupursigi nalang nila pumasok without thinking of the others' health man lang, just because madaming long quiz sa araw na iyon. yung iba nag sisinungaling din sa health declarations nila kasi iniisip nila baka pauwiin sila. pano naman ako magiging kampante sa school na onti lang yung risk sa classroom namin kung hindi naman sumusunod sa protocols mga kaklase ko, tapos hindi pa sila mag mamask. anong klaseng sistema to? pakisama, anyone? alam ko naman na since in the middle tayo ng pandemic ngayon wala talagang kasiguraduhan na safe tayo sa sakit, and sino ba naman may gugustong pumasok sa klase na madaming may sakit diba? edi if covid nga, naka hawa ka pa sa family mo pag uwi mo from classes. so ano na? tapos ung teachers hindi ba alam ung protocol? as far as i know, ang protocol is kapag may symptom hindi na dapat pinapapasok. bat sa amin, pasok daw pag kaya, so sinasabi niyo po ba na kahit may sakit, as long as kaya ng katawan, papasok parin? issue din sa canteen namin. siksikan tuwing recess. alam ko naman na normal lang yan pero, hindi manlang naka mask ung iba... tapos minsan may maririnig ka pag uubo ubo tas sisinghot sa pilahan, like tf? san na napunta ung health protocols na sinasabi niyo?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/zc6za8/hello_deped/,4 12 2022
H2H kwento: my groupmate today is a former DDS-BBM supporter,"my h2h experience today was very encouraging overall. may mga lumapit at nanghingi ng tarps at stickers. may mga undecided na nakinig sa aming kwento. meron pa kaming nadaanang tindahan na binigyan kami ng tarps kasi marami silang stock. sakto kasi ubos na ang collats namin. but the most moving part for me was after our h2h, nung nagkukwentuhan na kami. the most enthusiastic member of our group, who was always the first one to approach and talk to people, turned out to be a former dds-bbm die-hard. as in tipong online defender sya nina marcos at duterte noon. but he changed his mind after leaving facebook and joining twitter. dun sya namulat na fake news pala ang mga pinaniwalaan nya dati. gusto niyang bumawi ngayon kaya ang sipag mangampanya. i've been asked a few times today about vp leni's chances of winning. sa totoo lang, wala akong maibigay na diretsong sagot kasi hindi ko rin alam. basta ang alam ko, marami na tayong naipanalo sa kampanyang ito. maraming namulat, maraming naging mas involved sa ating laban. so let's not lose hope. the odds may not be in our favor (if the surveys are to be believed), pero si han solo nga nalagpasan ang asteroid field with the odds of 3,720 to 1, so why not take a chance diba 😁",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/uhj0s9/h2h_kwento_my_groupmate_today_is_a_former_ddsbbm/,3 05 2022
[Rant] Informal Settler Community Getting Worse,"you know, wala naman akong problema about informal settlers in general. i mean there were a lot of those who lived in metro manila grew up from one then umasenso na lang over the course of time and a lot of them are respectable naman. we grew in peace with our community surroundings in the past with them. kaso things are starting to get worse in our community surroundings: 1. they don't follow government ordinances anymore (bawal mag-videoke at mag-loudspeaker pag may online work/class hours but still, trigger happy sila sa mic and loudspeaker, tapos ang hilig pa nila mag-siga ng plastic at rubber) and the barangay unit or lgu doesn't even bat an eyelash towards them. heck, sila rin ang nagpapaputok nung new year despite the ordinance telling all of us not to do so. kami na mismo ang nakiusap na hinaan nila yung videoke at loudspeaker nila pag class hours pero aabot lang talaga ng isang araw o dalawa, then trigger happy ulit sila sa volume ng loudspeaker nila. 2. basta may space, lalagyan nila ng tambayan, extension ng sala set/dining area, karinderya, tindahan, billards place, or worse, videoke place. yung sapa sa likuran namin, supposedly catch basin yan ng baha in case of torrential rains pero ngayon tinatayuan na nila ng bahay. and nobody bats an eyelash. i warned my relatives that if that would continue, lalala ang baha sa amin but they only said i'm worrying too much. 3. in the past 2 years 3x na sila nasunugan (and 3x na rin kami muntik masunugan) dahil halos lahat (kung hindi lahat) sa kanila, naka-jumper connection lang tapos wagas nga kung mag-videoke at loudspeaker. madami nang linemen ang nag-inspect but... probably dahil naaawa lang sila wala rin sila ginagawa. we also had an agreement with the barangay that they should not build their houses within a considerable space around our subdivision's perimeter pero dahil di nga sinusunod, we had no choice but to build a stronger firewall. 4. so the pandemic happened -- dahil sila ang may ayuda, kahit nawalan sila ng trabaho sila din ang naghahappy-happy ngayon sa inuman. i can hear them na hindi na sila makainom dahil ubos na ayuda nila. 5. in a lot of roads with these communities around, wala rin silang pakialam when vehicles pass through -- basta tatambay sila and ikaw pa ang mahihiyang dumaan. i'm really trying to understand their predicament as hard as i can -- oo, laki sila sa hirap kaya yan lang ang nagpapasaya sa kanila or that's their only way for them to forget their poverty, or maybe because the government is getting more inept in managing poverty levels (we do all know that the government is making use of them for votes and, erm... more funds) -- i'm really trying to make peace that this is becoming the new normal dahil di naman na lahat nakakalabas pag may trabaho or pasok sa eskwela and we have to coexist like that -- kaso... is it just really me or things are starting to get worse with them?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/kvq7yc/rant_informal_settler_community_getting_worse/,12 01 2021
Converge Customer Service Problems,one of the worst customer service ever. here is what i have experienced: 1. bastos mga customer call agents nila hold daw for 2-3 mins then drop nila call mo at mapupunta ka survey 2. drop ang call mo pag di nila gusto tono pananlita mo ( hello! frustrated customer nga kasi service nyo pumapanget na) 3. they will not call you back kahit anong oras mo sabihn n tatawagan nila ( unprofessional) 4. landline ung number ng customer service nila so pag cp lng meron ka patay na ubos load yan 5. waiting time to talk to an agent for my experience 1 hr and 30 mins so dyan pa lng mauubos n patience mo 6. problems with connections? wala k maasahan! just be careful dito sa converge pag okay net nyo good pag may problem mas lalo k lng mafrufrustrate ps: to converge i say ausin nyo customer service nyo!,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/iy5my2/converge_customer_service_problems/,23 09 2020

Konti lang ang nag share ng experience ng bagyong rolly dito sa Catanduanes. Ito ang sa akin and sana mabasa niyo ang mahahabang experience ko.,"basically yung bagyo pwede na iconsider na f4 tornado sa us kung gagawin tornado shape ang bagyong rolly. saturday evening wala pa kaming naramdam, literal na calm before the storm. nakapag internet pa ko ng konti hanggang midnight. 3am sunday na nagsisimula ang lakas ng hangin. kahit naka typhoon guard, ramdam pa din ang hampas ng hangin sa gilid ng bintana. 4am na considered na landfall sa catanduanes. ito kaya ang pinakamalakas na bagyo sa buhay ni lolo ko. at tama nga, kasi zero visibility ang sa paligid namin kahit nakikitang umaga na. baha na ang first floor namin. at believe or not pero dahil sa change in air pressure naka bingi yung bilis ng hangin. parang kung lalong bibilis pa, puputok na ata ang ear drums ko. 7am sunday humina na ang bagyo sa catanduanes. nakikita na ang tabing bundok sa amin at unsurprisingly wala ng dahon dun na may landslides na padagdag. yung backyard namin na dating may dahon at puno ngayon ubos na. bagsak na ang mga niyog, at kung di binagong lugar ang mga aso namin patay sila sa na bagsak na niyog sa doghouse nila (ironically ang hindi gaano kasira ay ang bahay kubo namin). sa mga kapitbahay namin halatang nawala yung parte ng bubong nila. nagikot ako sa barangay namin na lahat ng poste either bagsak na or nakasabit sa puno. yung simbahan namin malaki wala na yung bubong, parang lalagyan palang eh. pero mabilis mag linis ang mga tao sa kalye, kailangan lang iaayos at least yung mga poste na baka matumba at matamaan ang mga tao. maraming stories na madaming nalunod or meron namatay pero wala naman kaming maayos na kommunikasyon so di pa gaano ka legit ang mga sabi sabi. pero ang alam kong totoo ay hindi pa kami magkakatubig for around 3 months since galing yan sa bundok na tamaan ng bagyo. then yung kuryente, kung di pa pupunta ang outside help di ko alam kailan pa yan makaayos, meaning extend pa lalo ang online class namin. pero yung nakakatakot ay yung isang barangay sa may bundok na converge ang tubig ng ilog sa tubig galing sa bundok kasama ng malakas na bagyo. isipin niyo yung usual public high school sa manila, baha hanggang kisame ng 1st floor at naabot na din sa 2nd floor. puro basag at putik sa classroom. at mga nara bagsak sa classroom. wala na dun pwedeng isalvage. meron din akong nabasa kanina lang na kinalimutan kami ng goberyno? i mean sure salty ako at sobrang laki ng disrespeto sa amin pero ganyan naman talaga dati. kung nagtanong ka tungkol sa catanduanes, ang masasabi nila sa visayas yan (mali sa luzon pa kami), or the usual wala sila alam. kung hindi malakas ang tourism ng catanduanes in the recent years, parehas lang ang sagot ng karamihan. sinabi na ng gob ng catanduanes pero uulitin ko, sa kultura namin ang bagyo. before and after agad agad na kami nagaayos. hindi na kami na expect ng outside help galing sa goberyno o ano man yan. kahit walang maabot ng tulong inprogress na kami para maayos ang lahat. pero di masasabi na konting damage lang sa amin. dami ko nang narinig na depressing stories dito and hopefully stories lang maabot niyan. dito muna ako, reserve pa din akong load and battery as long as possible. baka next year na kami magkakakuryente.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/joc5vx/konti_lang_ang_nag_share_ng_experience_ng_bagyong/,5 11 2020
Panic buying of mask?,"call me oa or anything you want pero nakakabahala ang pagka ubos ng masks sa bambang. i went there yesterday hoping na meron mask dahil kahit saang botika ako mag punta soldout na. inisa isa ko na lahat ng tindahan from jose reyes hospital to bambang area kaso lahat wala na surgical mask or n95. meron nagbebenta dust mask, kaso hindi niya kaya ifilter and virus kaya useless lang ang pagbili nito. hanggang sa nasaktuhan ko may nagpark na delivery van sa isang store doon at naglabas agad ng n95 boxes. dinumog agad ng mga tao at kapansin pansin na panay ""chinaman"" (term na ginagamit ng mga fil-chinese sa mga galing mainland). bumili na ako ng isang box (20pcs). pero ang mga chinaman bultuhan, ang gusto nila yung mismong brown carton box ang bilhin nila at kawawa ang mga pinoy na tingi tingi lang kung bumili. nagtataka ako, bakit nagpapanic buying ang mga chinaman? meron ba silang alam na hindi natin alam? sabi naman sa balita no need to panic dahil mas malakas pa ang sars compare dito, no need to buy mask kung wala kang sakit para hindi maubos ang supply, at unti lang daw ang naapektuhan ng corona virus sa china. my cousins who are fil-chinese dapat may flight sila sa friday sa japan. kaso nag cancel na sila. kagabi nagkausap kami at tinanong ko kung bakit sila nag cancel. ung kameeting nila chinaman ayaw na rin lumabas ng bahay sa china dahil malubha na ang mga sitwasyon ng mga tao doon lalo na ang mga naapektuhan na ng coron virus. iba ang numbers na cases sa news (siguro para hindi magpanic ang mga tao) at iba ang totoong bilang ng tinamaan na ng virus. kaya ang iba sa takot ang umaalis na nga china at pumupunta sa ibang bansa at dahil welcome na welcome ng govt natin ang mga chinese nationals, dito sila pumupunta. kaya nagpapanic buying ang mga chinaman ng masks dahil alam nila ang totoong ngyayari.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ew2w5t/panic_buying_of_mask/,30 01 2020

[sa mga sumunod na dekada nag-riot ang mga manggagawa nila sa mga iba't ibang lugar para iparating na hindi sila papayag sa pananakal sa kanila ng mapanglamang na sistema. ](https://www.loc.gov/item/today-in-history/august-20/#:~:text=to%20this%20page-,8%2dhour%20work%20day,congress%20to%20enact%20labor%20reforms)salamat sa pagiging maprinsipyo nila, sa kasalukuyan medyo malakas ang union culture sa mga industriya nila at meron silang potensyal na ipakausap na iaangat ang mga sahod nila. 2. sa russian sfsr simula 1917 ([at naulit ulit noong 1922](https://dc.etsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2667&context=etd) noong soviet union na ang tawag sa kanila), itinaguyod nila ang 8 hours maximum work day (siyempre di counted ang lunch at breaks) para sa lahat ng propesyon. ito'y noong pinapatalsik palang nila ang mga panginoon ng lupain at hindi pa nanunumbalik ang pamumuno ng kunseto ng diktaturya dahil sa mga duterte nila. ^(stalin \*ubo\* \*ubo\*) bago ang 1917 revolutions, kahit inabolish na ang moral na responsibilidad nila na pagsilbihan ang isang panginoon sa isang lupain habang buhay, [nagbayad parin ang mga magsasaka ng 30-50% ng kita nila](https://books.openedition.org/ceup/506?lang=en) sa dating-panginoon-ngayon-""landlord"" nila bilang upa. kung tutuusin, parang buhay ng kasalukuyang pilipino rin ang buhay nila sa ilalim ng russian empire dati - agricultural at walang pakialam ang gobyerno sa mga hampaslupa. 3. sa brazil naman noong dekada '80, sa mga huling taon ng diktadurya na sinuportahan ng simbahang katoliko, hindi sana sila magkakaroon ng welfare-oriented reforms, malakas na progressive social movement, malagong industrialized economy kung saan nakikinabang din ang taong bayan (kahit papaano), at di sana bibigay ng concessions ang mga sociopolitical elite nila kung hindi nagkaroon ng [matibay na kampanya ang mga grupo ng manggagawa kahit marahas at brutal ang pagkontra sa kanila](https://fds.duke.edu/db/attachment/73) \- isa na nga sa kanila si lula de silva at ang worker's party nila. meron pang examples mula sa ibang regions pero next time na. anyway, ano ang komon sa mga pro-equality movements na nabanggit? 1. base sa prinsipyong demokratiko na may twist ng local na kultura at malalim na pag-iisip. bakit, wala ba to sa atin? kung titignan mo ang kasaysayan, [galit ang mga manlulupig sa mga mahilig mag-aral ng mga bagay-bagay](https://youtu.be/3zq5e6a7g34). sa pilipinas, pinulis ang kaisipan natin simula nung dinedesenyo palang tayo bilang english-speaking neocolony, [ikinulong at pinatahimik ang mga magpupunla sana](http://smpnatow.org.ph/history_union.html) ng kamalayan at intelektwalidad pati na ang mga ginustong magtaguyod ng hustisya para sa mga kumakayod, [kahit pa nung lumaya tayo](https://www.esquiremag.ph/long-reads/features/the-dark-side-of-manuel-quezon-a2416-20191012-lfrm). tapos ang malala pa diyan, merong notion na hindi na kailangan ng pilipino na mag-isip bago kumilos, may mga propaganda na indigenous character daw natin ang pagiging marahas at dismissive sa kapwa. 2. kusa silang umarangkada sa organikong paraan. sa observation ko, ang pilipino masyadong sunod sa kung anong trendy, especially yung mga ideas na galing sa ibang lugar. hindi tayo mahilig magrefine ng sarili natin (connected sa nauna - hindi talaga natin naipasok to sa mga institusyong panlipunan natin dahil narepress nga), kaya hindi rin natin ma-apply yung mga bagong ideas. pag may refined naman na ibibigay sa atin, tinatanggap nalang natin at hindi na masyadong ineevaluate kung gaano ba katotoo (yung mga tipong ""pansariling pananaw""), at mas pinaniniwalaan natin ang tao based sa mga katawa-tawang qualities tulad ng ""tapang"", yaman, kapangyarihan (na mang-api ng kapwa), kasikatan, etc. so, ang bottomline sa lahat ng ito ay hindi natin nakumpleto yung liberalization stage ng isang napalayang demokratikong lipunan. hindi natin nabawi yung ninakaw sa atin noong unang panahon eh, hindi natin naidefine para sa sarili natin ultimo ang mga precondition ng sarili nating sistema ng demokrasya. pinabayaan nalang, so medyo nahuli tayo at papalabas palang sa feudal stage... kung meron pa tayong panahon. eto, ipapakita ko: &#x200b; ngayon naman gamitan natin ng inductive reasoning ang nangyayari sa atin sa pilipinas. anong meron tayo at ano ang wala tayo? * few families control most land * malamang sa malamang ang interes nila ay panatilihin ang ganitong status * either occupied nila ang mga high level public offices or sila ang mga primary backers and clients ng mga taong nakaupo (alongside financial moguls at malalaking companies- sila-sila lang naman ang trinity na gumagabay sa ekonomiya ng pilipinas, no such thing as socialized industry and fair bargaining dito) * siyempre ang mga agri-lords natin hindi mag-iintroduce ng land reform na gagawin silang kapantay na lamang ng mga mabababang uri in a real material sense * ""negotiate"" (stronghand) nila na panatilihing mababa ang mga sahod ng mga agriworkers, oldest trick in da buk * mabagal ang pag-industrialize ng agricultural sector sa bansa kasi hindi afford ng pangkaraniwang magsasaka ang sarili nilang production necessities * magdodonate ng farming equipments ang mga may ari ng farming land, pero paunti-unti lang, hindi exponential o trend-setting * hindi masyadong tumataas ang yields kaya kaylangan talaga mag import ng foreign agricultural products * sabayan mo pa ng inflation at mas tumataas na pagtangkilik sa imports, pangkain lang ang kinikita ng mga magsasaka lalo pang pumapailalim at nadudurog * dahil walang industrialization drive, at puro mahihirap din ang lower middle class sa provinces at maging sa mga metropolitan area, kahit sa labas ng gobyerno walang makakapag-fund sa mga efforts na i-incentivize ang transformation ng agricultural sector sa pinas (di tulad sa ibang bansa na nakakapag-raise sila ng many millions para sa mga funds at causes) * walang pumapasok na pera para sa causes ng pagbabago, kaya mahina ang kapangyarihan ng mga peasants kung subukan man nilang mag-organize, yung mga advocacy nila nananatiling tahimik, at minsan iniislander pa at nireredtag kasi totoo naman na taliwas sa pagpapanatili ng mga ""fundamental social, economic and political structures"" ang solusyong hinihingi nila * same thing din sa negligible na industrial economy natin, hindi talaga mainanationalize o maisosocialize kasi merong mga may social at political status na matatamaan pag iniangat ng estado ang kapangyarihan ng mga manggagawa upang mamili ng economic projects na pabor sa nakararami * ang dominant na financial sector (mga bangko, etc) sa pilipinas, mas lalo namang dependent sa mga bulsa ng mga ubod ng yaman * gagamitin pa ng mga superior players ang retorika ng eco-friendly policies para idistract ang mga medyo may malay na pilipino mula sa mga kinakailangang makatao na socioeconomic changes (ang irony ay patuloy parin namang bulok ang public transportation natin kaya ang mga pinoy bili ng bili ng fossil fuel automobiles at dagdag congestion, patuloy ang pag-tangkilik sa emissions na siyang wawasak din sa kanila, et cetera) magiging endless cycle to hanggang may violent social rupture talaga na mangyari kapag hindi na nakayanan, at magpatuloy na ang pag-abante ng kasaysayan sa isinumpang bansa natin na ito. at mark my words, hindi tayo makakasabay sa pagworsen ng climate disasters. yung mga innovations na kakailanganin we will not be able to fund from our own pockets as a society habang tuyong-tuyo tayo dahil sa mga bampirang humihigop sa bunga ng pawis ng lipunan natin. kung ikaw ay may anak o plano magkaroon, pag-isipan mo kung meron kang etikal na responsibilidad na ipaalam sa kanila kung ano ang naging takbo ng mundo mula noong simula palang, kung saan ito sana nagtungo at dapat patungo. hindi dapat sila maging ""kontento na"" at sunud-sunuran. kailangan mainstill sa mga susunod na henerasyon kung ano ang posibleng maaccomplish gamit ang mga resources sa panahon na ginagalawan nila. tulad ng mga slogans ng mga call center companies, kailangan maging disruptive at contrarian para makapag-adapt. kung kinakailangang ihatid sa huling hantungan ang mga nakagawiang pananaw at pagpapahalagang pilipino-katoliko, so be it. yan lang muna. salamat.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/zc2dtl/ano_ba_talaga_ang_kalagayan_ng_pilipinas_ganto/,4 12 2022
Story time: Uninformed News Edition,"a friend showed me a tiktok video of a supposed influencer sharing his thoughts on covid. the video (with embedded texts) went like this: ""storytime: covid 19 edition and then dinala sa hospital, dead on arrival. then sabi nung doctor sa mga kamag anak. kung papayag yung family na ang ilagay sa death cert nung namatay ay covid instead of heart attack 😱😱. so yun lang, idk what to do with that information kaya skl."" let me answer you, what you should do with that information is ask someone who is knowledgeable on the topic or at least someone who knows more than you do, cause you definitely don't know a lot. what you should not do though is post a video putting the hospital and medical professionals in a malicious light. for those of you who wants to be educated on the topic: anyone who is symptomatic, we can't mix with those who do not have the symptoms. ubo, sipon, lagnat, hirap sa paghinga, pananakit ng kasukasuan, pagsusuka, pagtatae or pagkawala ng pang-amoy at panlasa. you might be wondering, eh ang daming sakit with the same symptoms. yes, kaya nga po puno ang emergency rooms and covid floors. unless proven na negative ka sa covid (with rt-pcr), it is prudent that we don't place you with those without the symptoms. hospital protocols also dictates that anyone who arrives dead will be tagged as covid suspect (relating to the tiktok vid, paano nasabing heart attack? may ckmb ka? may trop i ka? may ecg ka ba???). covid also complicates underlying conditions like heart, brain problems which might have led to the demise of the patient. did the patient die of a heart problem? possible. did the patient die of covid? possible. hindi sya exclusive, and unless we do post-mortem swab, we will not know. the government ideally should fund more research centers and laboratories, to make testing more available kahit sa maralita. sayang yung mga inutang. hindi lahat ng tao afford ang 2-5k na rt-pcr swab na may 7 days validity lang. pag may rt-pcr ka na timely ang collection, you need not be tagged as suspect and can be treated sa covid negative area, therefore decongesting the covid suspect area, therefore freeing some resources that can be used for those in critical conditions. i am all for freedom of expression, but i also believe in responsible posting. supposed ~influencers~ should help us eradicate misinformation, use their platform for greater good. you also address your audience well. isang taon na tayong lockdown, ang dami nang dinagdag na letra sa cq. baka naman po? if you have any questions, if in any way i can explain things in simpler terms. i also urge people in the medical field to answer people the simplest way possible, to be ""patola"" na. our job extends way outside the corners of the hospital. di na lang covid ang kalaban, bad governance, ignorance and misinformation too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/mgihgq/story_time_uninformed_news_edition/,30 03 2021
Tagalized Story.,"may story ako. ako lang ang nag-iisang babae sa pinag-tatrabahuhan kong kumpanya at alam ko na kung bakit. isa akong fresh graduate sa kolehiyo at gusto ko na talagang makapag-simula ng career agad-agad na walang kinalaman sa pagse-serve ng pagkain, pagpupunas ng mga gamit, o pag-dadala o timpla ng kape sa isang matandang negosyante. sa naka-sanayan nag-aapply ako sa trabaho na may anim na araw na trabaho at marami-rami na rin akong interview na napagdaanan. alam ko na ang tinapos kong hrm na kurso ay hindi gaanong makaka-kuha ng magandang oportunidad, pero naniniwala pa rin ako na may mas maganda pang trabaho na naghihintay sa akin. kaya naman nanatili akong positibo, matyaga, at nag-aapply lang sa mga office jobs na may magandang benipisyo. kahit halos wala na akong mapag-kunan ng makakain dahil sa magastos na mga interview, at least mapapag-tibay naman nito ang kakaunting pride na natitira sa akin. halos tatlong linggo na rin ang nakalipas, may isa akong phone interview sa isang internet security company. ang kumpanyang iyon ay maraming offices sa amin at naghahanap sila ng bagong customer support specialist para sa kanilang international department. ang mga requirements ay maganda o mahinahon na boses, good spoken and written grammar, kakaunting tech-knowledge, at may kakayahang mag-trabaho sa umaga at gabi. ang office ay dalawang sakay lang sa mula sa amin, at mayroon silang magandang offer sa health insurance. nag-aapply ako kahit lmitado lang din ang alam ko sa computer science. naging maayos naman ang phone interview at matapos ang dalawang meetings sa hr at sa management, binigyan nila ako ng isang napaka-gandang offer (kahit na wala pa talaga akong experience sa kahit anong trabaho). sa loob ng unang linggo ko, kailangan kong magtrabaho nang regular shift na 9-5 (am) para maging online ako kasabay ng manager ko, na nag-trabaho sa ibang branch ng kumpanya. pagkatapos noon ay kailangan kong magtrabaho para sa regular na schedule ko bilang support - ang schedule ko ay 6 na araw na pasok (09:00 am -05:00 pm (am) at may isang araw na night shift 09:00 pm - 05:00 am respectively). sa unang araw ko, ang suot ko ay isang loose na sweater at mahabang skirt. bilang sa kaalaman ko ay sa ganitong uri ng trabaho ay karamihan mga lalaki ang empleyado, ayaw ko naman mag-cause ng unnecessary attention dahil sa provocatively o inappropriately pag-susuot ng hindi naayon na attire. ang lalaki sa front desk ay mukha namang maayos na tao. pinakilala n'ya ang sarili n'ya bilang si andrew bago n'ya ako tulungang mag-fill out ng mga paperwork at sinamahan n'ya na ako sa aking mesa at sa isang open space na workspace. nakatitig lang ako sa tila walang katapusang mga desks habang naglalakad kami, napansin ko na halos hindi mo makikita ang mga mukha ng bawat taong nagta-trabaho na naka-upo sa bawat desks. wala man lang akong nakita o napansin na babae habang nag-lalakad kami sa tila baga'y walang katapusang workspace na iyon, na talaga namang hindi normal at nakaka-bahala. kahit ang kalmadong presensya ni andrew ay hindi kayang maiwaglit ang wari kakaibang pakiramdam na naka-tuon sa akin. halos maubusan ako ng hininga ng maramdaman ko ang mga presensya ng bagong kong co-workers na tila nagsasabi na ""hindi ka nababagay dito"". nagulat ako ng biglang huminto si andrew sa isang desk na napuno ng mga printed memes, floral stickers, at isang lumang keychain na naka-patong sa harap ng monitor. bukod pa doon ay natatakpan na rin ng makapal na alikabok ang keyboard, monitor at ang natitirang ispasyo ng desk. ""ahhh... anong nangyari..."" sabi ni andrew sa medyo upset na boses. ""pasensya ka na."" sabi nito habang nakatingin sa aking mga papeles. ""ah... aya. dapat matagal na 'tong nalinis. kailangan kong maka-usap ang custodian"". ""ok lang 'yun"", sagot ko. ""puwede ko namang punasan na lang 'yan, wala namang problema"". medyo asiwa na noon si andrew, pero habang ginagala ko ang aking paningin ay malinaw na wala ng ibang bakanteng desk maliban doon. mabilis na natapos ang araw na iyon. natutunan ko na ang mga dapat kung gawin na sumagot sa support related phone calls at gumawa ng bagong ticket para sa system. kailangan ko ring i-monitor ang lahat ng pumapasok na chats at written tickets at isaayos ito base sa level ng urgency at type nito. hindi naman ako required mag-bigay ng technical advice, pero dapat maging pamilyar ako sa aming product software. bilang wala pa namang mga tawag ay pinaki-alaman ko muna ang manual. halos wala akong maintindihan sa mga naroon kaya naman ginogle ko na lang ang karamihan na nasa manual. kinumusta ako noon ng manager ko at mukhang hindi s'ya masaya sa mga lapses ko sa mga materials. dahil pakiramdam ko wala akong matinong nagawa at gagawin sa mga oras na iyon ay panandalian akong nag-break para linisin ang mesa ko. tumayo ako para tanungin si andrew kung saan makaka-kuha ng basahan para sa mesa ko. agad-agad kong pinagsisihan ang desisyon kong iyon. ang bawat mata sa kwarto ay tila napako sa pagtayo ko sa aking kinauupuan. hindi ako sigurado pero maraming mga bulungan akong narinig habang papalayo ako sa aking mesa. ang kaninang maingay na mga keyboard ay pahina nang pahina na halos kainin na ako ng lupa sa sobrang hindi ko pagiging kumportable at self-conscious na rin at the same time. napansin ko na lang na halos halikan ko na ang dibdib ko sa pagyuko para lang hindi ako mapansin. bago ako maka-rating sa isang palikong daan patungo sa front desk ay buong-lakas kong tinignan ang isang tila walang hiyang lalaki na nakatitig sa akin. hindi ko alam kung ano ang inaasahan ko, pero 'yung overall appearance ng lalaking naka-hooding pang-asar na 'yun ay nagbigay ng matinding kilabot sa buong katawan ko. siguro mga ka-edad ko s'ya pero hindi man lang s'ya nahiya o natinag sa pagkaka-titig n'ya sa akin sa kabila ng pagtitig ko sa kanya na may halong pagka-bwisit at inis. isang kakila-kilabot na ngiti ang sumilaw sa mga labi nito habang naka-titig sa parteng bukong-bukong ng aking mga paa at dahan-dahan itong bumalik sa kanyang monitor. inisip ko kung anong magiging reaksyon n'ya kapag tinitigan ko rin ng kaparehong paraan ng pagtitig n'ya sa akin ang tinitigyawat n'yang leeg. parehong reaksyon pa rin ang nakuha ko habang naglalakad ako pabalik sa aking mesa kasama ang box ng computer wipes sa mga kamay ko. may maganda ring nangyari sa araw na iyon. habang nililinis ko ang mga drawer ng mesa ko ay may nakita akong half-used notebook mula sa nakaraang nagta-trabaho sa mesa ko. hindi n'ya nilagay ang first name n'ya, kundi initial lang at last name: j. espiritu. pero, base sa dekorasyon ng notebook, sigurado ako na babae rin s'ya kagaya ko. ang mga naiwan n'yang gamit ay nagbigay ng kapanatagan sa akin, pero 'yung notebook ang talagang pumukaw ng atensyon ko. doon ay sinabi nito ang pina-ikli at simpleng manual gamit ang easy-to-undertand terms at mga explenasyon sa nakaka-litong terminolohiya at komplikadong panuto sa manual. sa tulong n'ya ay nasurpresa ko ang aking manager sa aking product knowledge pagkatapos ng shift ko. matapos ang isang magandang araw ay buong tapang akong gumala sa office at nag-explore sa pantry. binenta ni andrew sa akin ang top-notch coffee machine at snacks sa nasabing pantry, tutal nagugutom na rin naman ako matapos ang isang emotionally, intellectually and productive na araw na 'yun. (ansabe). tsaka, medyo butas na rin 'yung bulsa at namumula na ang mga credit cards ko, kaya naman ayos na ako sa ilang pirasong masasarap na cookies. habang papalapit ako ay may narinig akong malakas na usapan at tawanan sa pantry. sa katangahan ko ay inisip ko na baka naman mas mainit, friendly o kahit maka-tao na sila sa akin. subalit ang maliit na pantry ay napuno ng katahimikan the moment na pumasok ako sa pantry. may limang lalaki doon na mag-kakaiba ang edad at lalaki na naka-upo sa palibot ng isang maliit na lamesa, at lahat sila ay naka-titig na direkta sa akin. ""panget na araw?"" - tugon ng isang pang-asar na boses. agad kong itinaas ang ulo ko mula sa pagkaka-titig sa sahig para hanapin ang pinag-mulan ng boses. hindi naging mahirap sa aking hanapin at malaman na mula iyon sa naka-hoodie na walang-hiyang tumitig sa akin nung nakaraan lang. ""siguro marami ka ng experience?"" - sambit pa nito sa nakaka-asar na tono at may-unting pag-taas ng kilay. ""para makakuha ng komportableng trabaho. siguro sikat ka?"". ""ano 'to, high-school?"" - sagot ko sa malakas na boses. hindi ko hilig kumompronta ng tao, pero sobra na 'to. hostility is one thing, social awkwardness is another, pero pakiramdam ko isa 'tong 80's na high-school drama na mga trenta anyos ang mga bida bilang mga teenagers. ""nandito lang ako para kumuha kape at kung may problema ka sa trabaho ko, puwede mong dalhin sa hr kung ano man ang issue mo"". nagpatuloy ako habang ine-enjoy ang namumutla at pahiyang mukha ng mga taong 'yun. mabuti naman, gusto kong maramdaman nila ang katiting na discomfort na buong araw kung kinakaharap. pinili kong lumayo sa aking mga co-workers, naglakad ako ng taas noo pabalik sa mesa ko na may hawak-hawak na tasa ng kape. bago pa ako maka-upo at enjoyin ang masarap na kape, napansin kong may isang mensahe galing sa hindi kilalang number: ""you have quite an attitude, don't you?"" nanigas ako habang hawak ang cell phone sa isa kong kamay at kape sa kabila. habang prino-proseso ko ang tila breach sa personal security ko, naka-tanggap ulit ako ng dalawa pang mensahe. isa ay ang hubo't-hubad kong katawan na sinend ko sa una kong serious college boyfriend. ang pangalawa: ""bakit hindi mo ngayon ibigay 'yang picture sa hr?"" sa totoo lang, sobrang naapektuhan ako sa invasion ng privacy ko. pumasok ang kahihiyan sa akin at sobrang naiinis ako for drawing so much unwanted attention sa sarili ko. kasalanan ko lahat 'to. pumasok ako sa isang office na puno ng ethical hackers na may pare-parehong pangalan ng aso bilang password. walang duda na ang litratong iyon ay umiikot na sa buong office at lahat ng iyon ay salamat sa walang hiyang ka-trabaho ko, at isa na akong kakatuwang tao sa loob ng office. hindi ko na ginalaw ang kape ko at umuwi na lang, habang pinipigilan ko ang bawat emosyon na bumuhos hanggang makarating ako sa safety ng bahay. halos hindi ako matigil sa kaiiyak nung gabing 'yun, iniisip ko na ang mga mukha ng mga ka-trabaho ko habang tigang na tigang na nakatitig sa hubad kong katawan. mga alas tres na ng madaling araw, doon ko lang na-realize na wala ng kwenta para pa magpaka-lunod ako sa kahihiyan. kailangan kong gumawa ng plano para maka-survive sa ganitong uri ng workplace. quitting is not an option kasi masyadong malaki ang pasweldo nila para tumigil ako. tsaka, halos tinapay na lang ang kaya kong bilhin sa araw-araw. ang pangalawa kong option ay pumunta sa hr, but there's no way i was going to open that can of worms. hindi ko mapapatunayan kong sino talaga ang nag-send ng mga mensahe na iyon. last option? stick with it, keep my head down, gawin ang trabaho na pinasukan ko at 'wag pansinin ang iba pang mga harassment na gagawin nila. 'yun nga ang ginawa ko. sa kabuuan ng isang linggong training ko ay pumapasok ako on time, hindi ako umaalis sa desk ko liban na lang kung pupunta sa palikuran. iniwasan ko rin ang kahit anong contact kanino man at pinanatili ko lang ang aking mga mata sa mga inanimate objects. salamat kay j. espiritu, palagi akong on top ng training ko. sa bawat bagong task na galing sa manager ko, laging may katumbas na entry sa kanyang notebook. wala ng nakaka-gagong texts at face-to-face na kumprontasyon, pero mayroong kakatuwang pakiramdam na panibagong sisira sa kalagayan ko. sa darating na biyernes na ang huling training ko, na nagdala sa akin sa huling entry sa notebook. night shift survival guide: - matulog sa buong umaga bago ang shift at 'wag na 'wag kang matutulog. - walang sino man ang dapat maka-pasok. - panatilihing may pepper spray na dala. (sa kahit anong sitwasyon). - i-check ang bawat aisle, meeting rooms. huwag kalimutang i-check ang ilalim ng lamesa, balkonahe, kitchen tables at kahit likod ng cooler. - laging mag-open ng skype na naka-ready sa emergency in case na hindi gumana ang mobile services. - panatilihing updated sa kaibigan/pamilya/lover kada oras. ang nasabing listahan ay medyo may kahulugan. una, sabi ng hr puwede naman akong matulog sa pagitan ng 2-5 am, basta malapit palagi sa akin ang office smartphone. mayroon nga silang pull out couch sa isang conference room para lang talaga sa ganitong sitwasyon. pangalawa, ang buong shift ay phone calls, kaya palaging may paraan para maka-tawag mula sa office phone, tama? lastly, ang mga naka-outlined sa ""guide"" ay parang o.a at paranoid. siguro 'yung listahan ay satirical? (ewan ko). siguro si espiritu parehas kami ng pakiramdam tungkol sa mga tila patay gutom na mga asong cold-blooded na co-workers? pero 'yung isip ko nag-tatrabaho ng sobra-sobra para makita ang logic sa likod ng mga pag-iingat na ito. may kakatuwa akong pakiramdam na may importanteng impormasyon akong hindi nalalaman. lahat 'yun iniisip ko habang paalis ako ng bahay nung biyernes na 'yun, last day ng training ko. ""andrew"", - dahan-dahan akong lumapit sa kanya. ""puwede ba mag-tanong?"" ""sure thing"", - sagot n'ya na may maaliwalas na ngiti sa kanyang mga labi. ""nagtataka lang ako, bakit wala akong nakikitang ibang support agents. i mean, 'di ba dapat merong at least lima pang tao para ma-cover 'yung six-day rotation cycle?"" ""kailangan mong tanungin ang manager mo tungkol d'yan. most likely naka-kalat sila sa iba pang branch sa syudad. normal lang naman 'yun sa ganoong kaso"", - sagot n'ya. pakiramdam ko tapos na kami sa diskusyon na 'yun matapos s'yang bumalik sa final tasks n'ya para sa linggong iyon. ""meron bang ibang agent na nag-trabaho dito liban sa akin?"" - pagpapatuloy ko, dahil ganun na lamang ang kagustuhan kong malaman ang iba pang detalye sa babaeng nag-fill out ng notebook na s'ya namang ginagamit ko sa buong linggong iyon. ""oo, may isang babae na humawak sa posisyon mo ng panandalian"", - ani ni andrew, habang naka-titig pa rin sa screen ng kanyang screen. pero napansin kong tumigil na s'ya sa pag-tatype o pag-galaw ng mouse. wari ko ay naka-titig lang s'ya sa iisang spot sa monitor n'ya. ""andrew"", - nag-salubong ang mga kilay ko. ""sino 'yung nag-trabaho malapit sa main working space na talagang nakaka-inis? maputla, medyo payat, maitim at kulot na buhok?"" - tanong ko, habang nagpapaikot ng daliri sa bandang ulunan ko para i-describe ang pagkaka-kulot ng nasabing lalake. ""ah... si michael"", - sagot nito, napansin nito ang pagiging iritable ng boses ko. ""may problema ba? ginugulo ka ba n'ya?"" ""hindi"" - sagot ko, pero sa isip-isip ko ay nagtatalo na ang emosyon at sarili ko. ""have a good weekend, andrew"" ""ikaw din"", - sagot nito, halata na may pagtataka sa boses nito habang papaalis ako. sa buong weekend na 'yun ay binabalik-balikan ko ang mga nangyari sa akin sa unang linggo ko. pakiramdam ko may hindi sinasabi si andrew sa akin na importante. wala namang rason para maging iretable s'ya nung nabanggit ko 'yung babaeng nag-trabaho bago ako. may nag-reklamo na kaya kay michael dati? pu-puwede kayang si j. espiritu? si michael ba ang dahilan ng survival guide sa notebook? bakit s'ya umalis? napaka-daming teorya ang bumagabag sa buong weekend ko. bago ko pa nalaman, oras na para bumalik sa trabaho. ito ang araw na talagang sobrang daming trabaho. kahapon ay lunes, ang unang regular day shift. mabilis lang dumaan ang nasabing araw, habang aligaga ako sa pag-sagot ng tawag, recording, sorting at assigning ng dose-dosenang customer complaints sa system namin. hindi sapat ang salitang nasanay na ako at pagkatapos ng araw na 'yun ay sobrang pagod at ubos na ako. saktong maglo-logout na ako, naka-tanggap na naman ako ng mensahe mula sa hindi kilalang number. ""ang sipag mo naman. hindi na ako makapag-hintay na mag night shift ka"" seryoso?! ito ang kauna-unahang mensahe na bumalot sa buong pagkatao ko ng takot. agad-agad kong ginala ang paningin ko kung nasa paligid ba si michael para kumprontahin ko s'ya sa pagse-send ng mensahe, pero kanina pa pala s'ya umalis. matapos kong pakalmahin ang sarili ko, umuwi na ako at sinusubukan kong hanapin si j. espiritu online. ang pinaka best bet ko noon ay sa linkedin, at doon nga ay sinusubukan kong galugarin ang buong listahan ng mga babae na may kinalaman sa proficient technologies na naka-lagay sa profile nila (halos kakaunti lang talaga sila). nung wala akong makita ay pumunta ako kay andrew at doon nga sa friend list n'ya ay sa wakas nakita ko na ang hinahanap ko. may babae na pangalan ay jennah espiritu at unemployed ang status. nag-send ako ng friend request na may mensahe na nag-papakilala at tinanong ko s'ya kung hinarass ba s'ya ng isa n'yang ka-trabaho. sa wakas, pakiramdam ko may patutunguhan na ako, natulog ako at inihanda ang sarili para sa bukas na event. naisip ko na baka may kakaibang mangyayari dahil sa pagbabago ng schedule nung natulog ako ng miyerkules. nag-check ako ng linkedin halos pagka-gising ko mga ala una. walang kahit anong sign kay jennah, kaya naman natulog ulit ako para makapag-handa sa night shift. medyo kinakabahan ako at excited at the same time kasi puwede ko ng mas malibot ang buong place of work ko intimately. dahil walang day crowd, malaya akong makaka-gala at ma-eenjoy ang cookies, dumura sa baso ni michael, kahit ano! may mga iilan pa ring mga nag-tatrabaho nung dumating ako para sa shift ko, pero hindi ko naman iyon pinansin at dahil sa nag-uumapaw na mga tawag at chats na aasikasuhin. makalipas ang dalawang oras, ang bugso ng mga tawag at chats pati mga tickets ay unti-unting bumagal hanggang tuluyan na nga itong tumigil ng sabay-sabay halos alas onse na ng gabi noon. sumandal ako sa kinauupuan ko at ginala-gala ang mga paningin sa aking workspace. wala ng tao noon sa office at least sa nakikita ko. naka-bukas ang lahat ng ilaw pero nung tinanggal ko ang headphones ko, may narinig akong mahinang jingling melody sa hindi kalayuan. para s'yang christmas carol, pero hirap akong tukuyin kong saan ito nangga-galing. wala namang dahilan para matakot ako sa pangyayari, pero pakiramdam ko ang mga nagtayuang balahibo sa mga kamay ko ay nagsilbing alarm. nang tumayo ako sa aking kinauupuan, nawala 'yung melody. well, naging paranoid na ako dati. minsan ko ng inisip na na may lalaking sumusunod sa akin isang gabi hanggang nilagpasan n'ya ako at nagtungo sa kalapit na tindahan sa 'di kalayuan. kahit mag-isa lang ako, lagi kong dino-double at triple check ang mga lock ng bahay bago matulog. aaminin ko na ang mga takot ko ay wala naman talagang basehan. mayroong naka-iwan ng headphones na konektado pa rin sa computer nito at naka-on ang music. o siguro may office party sa ibang kumpanya sa baba ng building. ang makarinig ng kanta ay nakaka-takot lamang sa mga kakatuwang horror movies, 'di ba? 'di ba?! para maka-siguro, hinalughog ko ang office para maka-siguro na mag-isa na nga lang ako. habang naglalakad sa gitna ng mga magkaka-dikit na desks, naisip ko kung gaano ako ka-swerte na mayroon akong sariling corner spot. hindi ko siguro kakayanin na mapalapit sa kahit sinong mga hindi kaaya-aya kong mga co-workers. matapos ko ma-check ang bawat rows ay dumiretcho ako sa front desk area at nagmamasid sa mga kagamitan ni andrew sa paghahanap ng clues. nung wala akong makitang clues ay bumalik ako sa main room ng pantry. unti-unti ng mas nagiging relaxed ang mga senses ko at tsaka ko lang napag-tanto na napasarap ata ang taste-testing ko sa mga cookies sa halip na mag-hanap ng mga kahina-hinalang mga bagay. kailangan ko ng tumigil sa kaka-kain ng cookies, pero dahil bumalik na naman ang kaninang tunog na naririnig ko, mas malakas s'ya ngayon. at the same time, ang work smartphone ko (na kinakailangan dala-dala namin kung aalis kami sa aming work station) tumunog at may mensahe mula sa hindi na namang kilalang number. so, nag-eenjoy ka ba sa cookies, ha? nanigas ang buong katawan ko habang prino-proseso ng utak ko ang mga pangyayari. siguro hindi talaga umalis ng office si michael at ngayon tinatakot ako. kinalikot ko ang tenga ko noon at nakinig ng maigi. walang kahit sino sa pantry as least sa nakikita at naririnig ko. tsaka, kung si michael ay nasa main workspace, hindi naman ganun kahirap na hulaan o sabihin na kumakain ako ng cookies. habang dahan-dahan akong humihinga, hindi ko muna pinansin ang tunog at nakinig ako ng maigi kung may iba pa akong tunog na maririnig. wala. dahan-dahan, naglakad ako sa may pantry drawers at doon may nakita akong malaking kutsilyo. alam ko bang gumamit ng kutsilyo? hindi. kaya ko kayang paalisin kung sino man ang unarmed na kalaban? syempre. papunta na sana ako pabalik sa aking work station ng biglang may tawag na pumasok mula sa work phone. ipinosisyon ko ang sarili ko ng kumportable sa pader ng pantry, kutsilyo sa kanang kamay, cell phone sa kabila, bago pa ako maka-sagot with the standard customer support greeting. nag static na sa kabilang linya at iba pang ingay sunod ang tuluyang pagka-putol ng linya at katahimikan. nung tinignan ko ang cell phone, nakita kong naka-patay na ito. sinubukan kong buksan ulit ito, pero hindi na ito gumagana. ok, ngayon kailangan ko ng bumalik sa computer ko in case na may pumasok pang mga tawag. naalala ko bigla ang isa sa mga guide na galing kay jennah habang isinusuksok ko ang walang kwentang cell phone sa bulsa ko. - laging mag-open ng skype na naka-ready sa emergency in case na hindi gumana ang mobile services. nangyari rin kaya 'to sa kanya? ang mga instructions sa notebook ay unti-unti ng nagkaroon ng kahulugan, at minumura ko ang sarili ko dahil sa pagiging tanga. sa oras na lumabas ang mga salita sa bibig ko ay may isa na namang mensahe ang dumating sa cell phone. kinuha ko iyon at sinubukang i-unlock, pero 'yung regular home screen ay hindi lumalabas. ang lumabas lang ay isang white screen na may maikling text. putang ina. ang mga babae dapat hindi ginagamit ng ganung mga uri ng salita. matapos kong mabasa 'yun ay nawala na ito sa screen at may panibagong text ang lumabas. bakit hindi ka lumabas at makipag-laro? huwag mo ng isiping bitbitin pa 'yang kutsilyong hawak mo. wala ring magagawa 'yan sa hawak kong baril. tinapon ko ang cell phone ko sa lapag at agad-agad ay nagtungo ako sa aking computer. ang tunog ay mas lalong lumakas habang papalapit ako sa aking lamesa, doon ay nakita kong may isang baboy na stuffed toy. may fabric button ito sa bandang paanan at music note na kasama. dito nagmumula ang tunog at nagpapatunay lamang na hindi ako mag-isa at may kung sino akong kasama. ang malala pa, pinapanood nila ang bawat galaw ko at sinusubukang takutin gamit ang mga laruang pambata. unti-unti ng dumadaloy ang pagpapanic sa aking buong katawan at naghahanda na sa fight or flight scenario. huminga ako ng malalim, sinusubukan kong pakalmahin ang buong katawan ko. so far wala pa naman akong naririnig ng kahit anong palatandaan na may ibang tao sa loob ng office. may mga background noises galing sa syudad sa labas at ang mga ingay mula sa naka-limutang patayin na computer ng isang employee. kung sino man ang gumagawa nito sa akin, kailangan kong malaman ang kanilang eksaktong lokasyon para maplano ko ng maayos ang pag-takas ko. isa pa, kailangan kong maka-kuha ng tulong sa lalong mas madaling panahon. habang iginigilid ko ang laruan ay umupo na ako sa aking upuan at pinull-up ang skype for business application. mabilis akong nag-dial ng 911, habang naka-loudspeaker ang telepono. tumunog na nga ang dial tone at agad-agad ay may live operator na sa kabilang linya. ibibigay ko na sana ang mga hindi kanais-nais na pangyayari sa akin ng mga oras na iyon ng may biglang humawak sa bukong-bukong ko mula sa ilalim ng lamesa. halos maubos ang buong lakas ko sa pagsigaw habang nagpu-pumiglas ang mga paa at mabilis na tumakbo sa abot ng aking makakaya sa bilis na hindi ko akaling kaya ko. may narinig akong kung anong kumusyon sa aking likuran habang tumakbo, kasunod ng isang malakas ng putok, na inisip ko na lamang na galing sa kung ano o sino man ang humahabol sa akin. bago ko pa malaman ay halos nasa ground floor na ako papunta sa pinto lagpas sa gwardiya na halatang nagulat sa mga nangyayari. ang malamig na hangin ay mabilis na pumasok sa manipis kong sweater habang papalapit ako sa isang malapit na pedestrian para humingi ng tulong. tumawag sila ng 911 at ang mga pulis ay agad namang dumating wala pang sampung minuto. habang naghihintay ako kasama ang gwardiya para sa kanilang pag-dating, hindi maalis sa isip ko ang sinulat ni jennah na warning, at kung gaano ako ka-tanga para ipagsa walang bahala ang mga ito. - i-check ang ang bawat aisle, meeting room. huwag kalimutang i-check ang ilalim ng lamesa, balkonahe, kitchen tables at kahit likod ng cooler. agad-agad namang sinulat ng pulis ang mga nangyari sa akin at iniwan ako kasama ang isang pulis officer, umakyat s'ya para i-check ang office. wala namang naka-labas-masok sa building mula nung tumakbo ako palabas, kaya malaki ang posibilidad na naroroon pa rin ang salarin at nagtatago sa loob. sa pag-iisip ay halos bumaliktad ang buong sikmura ko at mas lalo akong lumapit sa may armas kong kasama. maya-maya pa matapos kaming iwanan ng mga pulis, ang kasama kong pulis ay nag-radyo at isa-isa may mga boses na nagpapa-palit-palit sa radyo na humingi ng backup at nga mga codes na hindi ko maintindihan. mabilis na nag-escalate ang mga sumunod na pangyayari. imbis na pauwi ay dinala nila ako sa police station at doon ay nanatili ako sa isang interrogation room ng halos 2 oras bago pa sa wakas may dalawang pulis officer ang kumausap sa akin. pagod na ako noon, miserable ang kalagayan at higit sa lahat litong-lito sa kung papaano naganap ang mga pangyayari. gusto ko ng umuwi pero nanatili pa ako ng ilang oras para i-kuwento ang mga pangyayari sa dalawang pulis officer. 'ahh... meron kang kutsilyong hawak habang tumakbo ka galing sa pantry papunta sa lamesa mo? sigurado ka ba?' tanong ng isang nakaka-tandang officer na nagpakilala bilang senior investigator manlapig. 'ah. ah... oo.' pautal-utal kong sagot sa kanya. 'naniniwala akong meron. nag-papanic na ako noon, kaya mahirap sabihin. tapos may baboy na stuffed toy, ' sabi ko, habang tila baga'y nawawalan ako ng abilidad na mag-isip ng tama. 'at naniniwala ka na ang taong humaharass sa'yo ay si michael villareal?' sabi ng isa pang officer, hindi ko maalala 'yung pangalan n'ya. wala s'yang badge. 'hindi ko alam buong pangalan n'ya, pero wala na akong ibang kilala na iba pang responsable.' 'at sa huling pagkakataon, just for the record, anong nangyari matapos mong mag-dial ng 911?' tanong ni manlapig sa ika-apat na pagkakataon sa gabing 'yun. 'may kung sino ang humawak sa binti ko. bukong-bukong, actually. nangyari 'yun bago pa ako magkaroon ng pagkakataong ipaliwanag ang sitwasyon sa operator. nagsusumigaw at piglas ang mga paa ko tapos tumakbo hanggang may makita akong tao sa labas na pina-tawag ako sa 911 para sa tulong.' sagot ko, habang pagod na pagod sa paulit-ulit at paikot-ikot na pagtatanong. 'si michael villareal ay natagpuang patay sa hindi kalayuan ng iyong lamesa nung pumunta ang officer namin sa pinang-yarihan ng insidente. nakita mo ba ang kanyang katawan nung tumakbo ka palabas ng office?' tanong ng isang officer. halos malaglag ang panga ko sa mga narinig ko at tumitig sa dalawang pulis habang balisa at nanginginig sa takot. 'hi.. hi.. hindi,' pabulong akong nag-salita, 'hindi ko maintindihan,' 'sinaksak s'ya hanggang sa mamatay gamit ang malaking kutsilyo. ang katawan n'ya ay balot ng dalawampu't-tatlong saksak,' paliwanag ni manlapig. 'at nakita namin ang kutsilyo ay nakabaon sa bibig nito, dahilan para dumikit ito sa sahig diretcho sa lalamunan,' 'may rason kami para pagsuspetyahan na ito rin ang sinasabi mong kutsilyo,' dagdag pa ng pangalawang officer. nakatitig ako sa dalawang pulis officer ng tahimik, hirap akong intindihin ang mga pangyayari lalo na't ang utak ko ay halos mawala na sa ulirat. 'ang mga sinabi mo ay nagpapatunay lamang sa mga natagpuaan namin sa cell phone ni michael villareal. nalaman namin na may roon siyang hacking apps,' pagpapatuloy ng senior officer. 'natagpuan din naman ang ilan mo pang mga hubong larawan at ang mga mensahe na iyong nabanggit. mayroon s'yang baril at nakita rin naman ang basyo ng bala nung binaril ka n'ya habang papatakas ka.' 'ang hindi namin maintindihan ay kung papaano s'ya namatay.' dagdag pa ng pangalawang officer, halatang hindi s'ya naniniwala sa aking reaksyon. 'ok lang kung napatay mo s'ya dahil sa self-defense, aya. may balak s'yang masama sa'yo.' 'hindi,' pautal-utal kong sagot. 'pangako, wala akong ideya... oh, oh my god.' naiyak na ako dahil sa mga nangyayari. 'ibig kong sabihin, nung nakaraang buwan lang may nag-report sa kanya galing sa isa n'yang co-worker,' sabi ni manlapig. 'jennah,' bulong ko. 'kilala mo si miss espiritu?' tanong ng pangalawang officer, at ng suspetya sa kanyang mga mats. 'hindi,' ako ang pumalit sa lamesa n'ya at nakuha ko ang notebook n'ya. dapat sinabi ko na 'to kanina pa. anong sabi sa report? doon nga ay nagtitigan ang dalawang pulis at maka-lipas ang ilang sandali ay inilatag at ipinaliwanag ni manlapig ang mga hindi magandang nangyari kay jennah na halos mangyari na sa akin. si jennah espiritu ay dumiretcho sa pinaka-malapit na hospital mula sa kanyang unang night shift tatlong buwan na ang nakakaraan. sobrang bugbog ng katawan n'ya at sugatan, at gustong mag-file ng anonymous rape kit. ang natanong damage n'ya sa kanyang puwerta ay sobrang severe na kinailangan n'yang sumailalim sa operasyon at magpatahi. nag-file s'ya ng police report makalipas ang dalawang buwan matapos s'yang hindi pumasa sa probationary period sa inyong kumpanya, ng nawala s'ya sa trabaho (ang nagiisang paraan para mabayaran ang kanyang utang sa hospital). ang nangyari ay ang kanyang aligasyon kontra kay michael villareal, na gumastos s'ya ng malaki sama mo pa ang hindi mabilang na kanyang mga co-workers na kumontra sa kanya laban sa magalang at kaaya-ayang katangian ni michael. 'pero kahapon lang ay iniurong na n'ya lahat ng mga isinampa n'yang kaso kay michael,' sabi ng walang badge na pulis. 'kasalukuyan naming inaalam ang kinaroroonan ni espiritu para ma-interview namin s'ya. sigurado ako na ngayon malinaw na kung bakit may suspetya kami sa iyo bilang nakikilala mo espiritu.' nagpatuloy ang mga tanong ng dalawang pulis hanggang may isang lalaki na nag-abot sa kanya ng isang sobre. natukoy na ng forensics ang fingerprint na nakita sa kutsilyo at ang blood-spatter patterns. kinailangan ko ring mag-submit ng dna samples para maka-tulong sa imbestigasyon at sa wakas ay pina-uwi na nila ako. sa bahay, dahil sa sobrang pagod, hindi ako maka-tulog. wala akong gamit na naiuwi. bag, cell phone at kahit ang jacket ko ay kinailangan i-submit bilang ebidensya. kaya naman napilitan akong gamitin ang luma kong laptop, umaasa na malibang sa internet. ang browser ko ay naka-login pa rin sa linkedin account ko mula sa nakaraang login, at nirefreshed ko ang page bilang naka-sanayan. isang maliit na red icon ang lumitaw na mayroon akong bagong mensahe. jennah. nagre-reply na s'ya sa akin. don't worry, sis. i took care of it. ❤️",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/t77k69/tagalized_story/,5 03 2022

I painted my own classroom today,"i'm a deped teacher and we are having our brigada eskwela. part of it is the so-called oplan baklas (sigurado ako na narinig niyo na ito). at dahil nagtanggal kami ng mga decorations, kailangan irepaint lahat ng classrooms. ichecheck ng principal at supervisor kung presentable ba ang classroom bago ang pasukan. kanina, nagpintura kami ng kasama kong teacher at nagulat kami kase wala palang budget yung paint galing sa school. kami yung bumili ng pintura tsaka mga materials (2k out of our own pockets). nakakalungkot lang kase ang dami ng nakukuhang donations ng school at di rin biro ang budget na nakuha ng deped (na malaking part ang dinala confidential fund) pero sa kung saan saan lang napapadpad yung budget imbes na pumunta sa dapat puntahan. kami din pala nag aayos ng mga upuan at lamesa na nasisira. at yung mga electric fan na laging pinapadonate every year, wag na kayo magtaka, 3 months lang ata tinatagal sa amin bago masira. same with televisions. di naman magpoprovide si deped. either magtitiis sa init or may maglalabas ng pera mula sa sariling bulsa. i've never personally asked my students to donate these things pero nakakalungkot kase minsan ramdam ko pinag iisipan ng parents na inuuwi namin sa bahay yung mga gamit pero di naman. sira lang talaga. nakakalungkot din na yung mga bwakanang pulpolitiko, ang laki ng pera na nakukuha pang world tour pero kami pampaayos lang ng upuan at lamesa pinagdadamutan pa. sorry if i'm venting here. nalulungkot lang talaga ako because it keeps getting worse every year.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/15x97m2/i_painted_my_own_classroom_today/,21 08 2023
Some jeepney drivers don’t deserve their license.,"meron talagang mga jeepney drivers na mae-encounter ka na mapapaisip ka nalang, “paano kaya nakakuha ng lisensya to?”. sunod-sunod na traffic violations, mainit ang ulo na idadamay pa yung mga inosenteng pasahero, di nagbibigay ng sukli, etc. i don’t want this post na maging anti-poor. i know all of them just want to make a living and provide for their families but that doesn’t mean naman na they can just be reckless sa road, right? when you’re driving, especially a public vehicle, hindi lang life mo ang at risk, mga pasahero mo rin. last friday i encountered this extremely rude jeepney driver along alabang-zapote road. just to be clear hindi ako yung sinungitan nya but other pasahero pero i feel really bad for them because isipin mo sobrang init na ng panahon and pagod ka from work or school tapos ganyan pa ugali ng jeepney driver na masasakyan mo. like this one guy said “sa tabi lang po” and i’m guessing he assumed that the driver didn’t hear what he said so the pasahero said “para po” ng 2 times pa ulit. the driver got mad and shouted “sa susunod nga na nagmamadali kayo bumili kayo ng sarili nyong sasakyan ha”. nasa tabi ng driver ako nakaupo nun so rinig na rinig ko talaga and i was shookt. then meron pa na may nakasabay sya sa kabilang lane na friend nyang jeepney driver din and nag kwentuhan sila habang nag d-drive ng sobrang bagal it was causing traffic na sa likod, one driver behind him talagang nag b-beep na sa kanila and this caused him to explode again and shouted “putang ina mo kanina ka pa busina nang busina ha”. tapos one person said “para po” pero this time di talaga narinig ng driver kaya napahinto sya sa may bandang intersection and he got pissed again and shouted about how filipinos are pasaway daw and stuff na bakit ngayon lang daw bababa. gosh, the amount of times i rolled my eyes during the byahe talaga. then the driver stopped suddenly and said sa lahat ng pasahero “wala bang bababa dyan?” then no one responded but i noticed this one student slightly leaning forward to get a clear view of the road ahead, obvious naman na bababa sya malapit na. the driver ignored this and exclaimed “wala na bababa dyan ng alanganin ha” sabay harurot ng sobrang bilis, completely ignoring the poor student saying “para po” and di tumigil hanggang di nakarating sa next stop light. after that thing talaga i realized di ko na kaya tagalan yung driver na yun, bumababa nalang ako nung medyo malapit na sa destination ko. when i looked back pa nga i saw na he parked his jeepney na sa side ng road and got off, habang meron pang pasahero sa loob. he just decided that’s the end of his byahe and wala na magagawa yung ibang pasahero but bumaba nalang kahit malayo pa ang destination nila. buong byahe rin bigla bigla syang sumisingit sa ibang lane, nag overflow, di nag si-signal, etc. i was scared for my life. sorry for the long rant. this really just pissed me off. there’s so many things i wish i’ve done like take a picture of his plate number and file a report to ltfrb pero di ko rin nagawa because i was also slightly bothered by the thought na baka magalit sya sa akin if i even dare take a picture of his jeepney.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/17deymr/some_jeepney_drivers_dont_deserve_their_license/,21 10 2023
One Ayala appreciation post,"my mother consistently gives rave reviews about how convenient one ayala is. we’re from the south and she works in qc. since naging senior citizen siya, tinatamad na siyang mag-drive. she takes the mrt from magallanes station and gets off at quezon ave because her office is a mere five minutes walk from centris. pauwi, sa one ayala na siya sumasakay ng bus or uv express. tunay nga, ang laki ng one ayala and sobrang convenient. i had the opportunity to experience it for myself with a 14-month old in tow. i had stuff to take care of in makati last thursday so my husband dropped us off at salcedo before he headed off work. wala kaming yaya for baby, kaming tatlo lang talaga ang team mates kaya lagi kaming magkakasama and we usually drive. last week was an exception because my husband had a meeting he can’t miss, and my makati appointment was likewise immovable. after my thing at salcedo, our baby (who’s in a stroller) and i walked to ayala triangle, and then greenbelt, passing through landmark and glorietta, to sm makati. hindi kami nag-underpass, efficient for us ‘yung connecting bridges so hindi hassle. when we got to one ayala from sm makati, i completely understood my mom’s rave reviews. malamig ang ac, marami-rami nang restaurants and shops (although mas marami pa rin ang vacant/ under construction), maluwag ang lalakaran, maluwag ang cr, and malinis! nakapagpalit ako ng diaper ni baby without breaking a sweat. i initially planned sumakay ng uv express pauwi—i rarely take the bus home back when i still commute because my experience has always been horrible—but 4pm pa ang first trip and it was only 1:30pm. gusto na rin umuwi ni baby kasi napagod kakatakbo sa loob ng one ayala mall. nag-enjoy siya sa luwag haha. nasa gitna ‘yung bus bay ng route namin but hindi hassle tumawid kahit may tinutulak akong stroller. there were pedestrian lanes and may nagma-manage ng traffic flow. walang tumatalon into a moving bus para lang makasakay, and hindi mapanghi. a far cry from the previous bus lane sa likod ng dusit! when we got to our route, nakasakay kami agad ng bus and umalis din kaagad kahit walo lang kaming sakay. hindi siksikan, walang nakatayo! next time we’ll try pumila sa uv terminal. ang lamig din doon, maliwanag, maluwag, may seats, malapit ang malinis na banyo. ibang-iba sa pagpila sa parksquare na sobrang init lalo na ‘pag rush hour. may iwata fans nga pero mas nakakalagkit ng feeling. plus, nakatayo sa pila and hindi mo na makita nasaan ang dulo haha. i believe people here have mixed feelings about one ayala, but for moms like me na bitbit ang baby ‘pag umaalis, i’m sure they’ll appreciate the comfort and convenience. sana ma-maintain ang one ayala, and ganitong convenience sana ang abutan ng anak ko ‘pag nag-college na siya para hindi siya tamarin umuwi. and sana ma-replicate din sa iba pang areas, and ma-develop to make them walkable kahit may kasamang baby, with or without a stroller.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/174cqmb/one_ayala_appreciation_post/,10 10 2023

My FlipTop Ahon 13 - Day 2 Experience,"just woke up late in the afternoon due to the exhaustion i had experienced and i just want to share this. let me preface this by saying i don’t mean to offend or disrespect the fliptop staff, emcees, and especially anygma with the some of the things that i’ll say in this long post. this is the 4th event that i have attended alongside with my partner, and we both have a great time whenever we go to their events. with that being said, ahon 13 - day 2 was memorable in the worst way possible for both of us. the way that the event should play out is that there 10 battles and the flow of the event should be like this: 3 battles -> short break -> 3 battles -> short break -> 2 battles -> short break -> 2 battles. note that the rap battles averaged around 30 mins. each. the last 2 battles are the match between sinio vs apekz that fans have been eagerly waiting for almost 5 years to happen, and the isabuhay 2022 finals between pistolero vs luxuria. specifically, the sinio vs apekz match is the single reason that most fans are attending this event. okay, so the first battle was between g-clown vs jr-zero (great battle btw). when the battle was about to start, electricity went out in the venue. may bumigay ata sa circuit breaker. anygma told us that to wait for about 40 mins to fix the situation. after waiting for about an hour, electricity came back and the first battle was able to start with no further issues. then the second battle started, which is the royal rumble match between sur henyo vs kregga vs batang rebelde vs lil strocks vs bagsik. this is when another problem of the venue has started to rise. the venue by the way is asuncion badminton court in san juan, manila. it has a narrow entryway which is not really a problem for a badminton court. around second battle ay napansin ko na dumami na mga tao sa venue, kahit yung entryway para sa gen ad at vip section ay mapupuno na pati na rin yung 2nd at 3rd floor. halos siksikan na kami sa vip section, at yung partner ko ay umalis na kasi di na raw siya makahinga dahil sa init, hindi siya ganun katangkad compared sa mga ibang tao sa section namin kaya mas ramdam niya ang init. sa case ko naman medyo di na kinaya yung init at nag-alala na sa partner ko ay di ko mabigyan ng full attention ang battle, kaya umalis na rin ako sa vip section at napansin ko na ang dami rin palang gustong umalis dahil sa init. nung nakalabas na ako sa vip section ay sinamahan ko na partner ko sa isang section ng venue na may hangin pa na pumapasok. after matapos yung 2nd battle ay nagkaruon ng mahabang break, may narinig na rin kami sa iba na may nahimatay na rin ibang tao sa crowd. natawa ako sa partner ko nung nag cr siya sa 3rd floor, sabi niya parang nasa bilibid siya dahil sa nakikita niya sa upper floors, mga lalaki nakahubad na mga shirts nila habang naka upo sa railings dahil sa sobrang init. almost 1 hr kami naghintay bago nag announce si anygma na dahil sa critical na sitwasyon namin sa venue ay uunahin na nila yung 3 main event level battles para mabawasan ang mga tao sa venue. the 3 battles are m zhayt vs cripli, pistoleto vs luxuria, and sinio vs apekz. nag stay parin kami ng partner ko sa same section na may hangin pa since rinig naman namin yung mga laban sa speakers. after nung 3 battles ay andami yung nagsi-alisan sa venue, halos 1/4 ng crowd na lang ang natira. around 2 am naka-alis na yung ibang tao sa venue ay kumain muna kami ng partner ko sa food stalls nila, this is also when i used the cr in the 2nd floor for the first time during the event. sabi ng partner ko walang flush yung cr nila sa 3rd floor, sa 2nd floor ganun din pero bruh, may natirang explosion pa sa inidoro tapos ang lawak ng brown puddle ay ma no-choice ka na tumapak dun para maka ihi ka lang. malala rin yung sa 3rd floor nung sinamahan ko partner ko, nasa labas ka palang pero ang tapang ng amoy. i-mention ko na rin na andaming basura sa venue, kulang yung designated trash bags sa venue. sa 2nd at 3rd floor naman wala kang makikita trash bags dun pero daming plastic bottles at beer cans sa tabi tabi. nung nag start na 6th battle between invictus vs fukuda, napansin ko na inaantok na partner ko sa pagod. decided kami na quits na sa event kahit sa gusto naming panuorin yung remaining battles pero halos 10 hrs na kami naka tayo dun sa venue eh hindi na talaga kinaya ng katawan namin ang pagod. tumambay muna kami sa mcdo na malapit sa venue para kumain ulit at maka-idlip saglit ang partner ko bago kami umuwi. so ayun, our fliptop ahon 13 – day 2 experience, aka san juan city jail experience. baka di lang talaga kaya katawan namin na magtagal sa mga ganung events. i feel bad lang sa mga iba na first time nila maka-attend ng fliptop event tapos ganito ang naranasan nila. hopefully anygma and fliptop staff will learn from this. thank you for having the time to read my long post. edit: i thought that half ng crowd ang nawala after the sinio vs apekz battle, but turns out halos 1/4 na lang ang natira upon seeing a pic of the whole venue comparing the crowd before and after their battle.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/zozzn0/my_fliptop_ahon_13_day_2_experience/,18 12 2022

Bakit May ang elections tapos June 30 nag uumpisa ang terms?,"kung kamg anak ka ng isa sa framers ng 1987 constitution, gusto ko sana malaman mula sa ninuno mo ang rationale behind starting a term on june 30? imo, kapag may ang elections, technically summer pa din yun at sobrang init sa mga public schools na pinagdadausan ng elections. lalo pa sa automated elections, gat maari ang mga makina ay hindi naiinitan lalo pa't hindi naman airconditioned ang mga classrooms. ganun din pag inauguration day. pag outdoor event siya, mainit din. buti nga si du30, sa malacañang ginawa ang inauguration. baka pwede natin isuggest na amendment, january ang elections tapos march 1 ang start ng term. pag january kasi, panahon ng amihan. hindi mainit. kahit hindi airconditioned ang classroom, gagana ng maayos ang makina. caveat nga lang, sasabay sa christmas season ang campaign period. pero ganun din naman. pwedeng gumawa ng ruling na bawal mangampanya ng christmas and new year. just like bawal mangampanya pag biyernes santo. palagay ko, the way how we time the start of the terms need a review na. imo, hindi talaga akma na summer season ang election season. thoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/vn4rav/bakit_may_ang_elections_tapos_june_30_nag_uumpisa/,29 06 2022

"After two years, I visited EDSA and Makati again.","hi i am a probinsyano from central luzon 👋. i was based in mm before covid happened and never came back after. at ngayon na free na, i decided to travel again to visit dahil namiss ko (hehe) at to prepare if pababalikin na kami sa office. as i always practically take the buses, here is my commuting experience: 1. nabago na pala bus routes ng mga galing north provinces. hindi na pumapasok sa may cloverleaf to edsa, pero sa same station pa din naman ang babaan. sa mga baranggay na siya dumadaan. 2. may designated na babaan na sa edsa, barricaded, and most is sa tabi ng mrt stations. i found it organized pero grabe ang layo pala ng lakaran dagdag pagod pag sumabay sa init. kawawa ka pala kapag wala kang kotse sa edsa ngayon at hindi malapit sa station ang pupuntahan mo.for example sa boni, wala ng babaan so either ortigas or guada kana bababa. then lakad ka. 3. some roads were re-routed for example papasok ng makati, instead of 1 aircon bus to buendia lrt, you need to take 2 jeepneys na. hassle at pagod, lalo na sa mga papasok sa work. pero ang kagandahan one way na siya. dati kasi traffic doon lagi pag rush hour. 4. lastly pauwi sa province, sa edsa carousel, instead sa may footbridge, sa may q mart na ang babaan. grabe ang layo pala hahaha. di ko sure if magkadistansya sila ng mrt to provincial bus stations (victory, genesis, five star etc.). in conclusion, ang hirap pala bumyahe as a probinsyano ngayon na walang kotse. kung ako nahirapan, naisip ko lang what more sa mga araw araw na nagttrabaho na sa public transpo umaasa at senior citizens na naglalakad lng. ang tataas pa ng footbridge ng iba. though i am not sure if this has more advantages para ma ease ang traffic, pero in my opinion, siguro may other options pa to meet in the middle. iconsider ang mga normal na mamamayan at maimprove pa ang quality ng buhay sa maynila. feel free to correct me baka may schedules pala or mas convenient na paraan bumyahe po ngayon. friday to sunday kasi ako bumyahe. thank you for reading! 😊",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/t8fkp0/after_two_years_i_visited_edsa_and_makati_again/,7 03 2022

On-Going Troll Post Being Shared Around Social Media,"so, a relative shared this to me today. i'm pretty sure it's a troll post meant to spread panic and disruption for whatever reason, but do please stay aware (and intelligent) of posts like these! unfortunately, someone out there is going to believe this (someone not american). ================================================================================ a l e r t !! !! !! please read now !! !! !! attention everyone!!! \[must read!\] step 1: wag kayong papayag na mag swabtest kasi magiging positive kayo sa covid at madadamay lahat ng taong lumapit sa inyo. step 2: wag na wag niyong papabayaan ang mga anak niyo lalo na ang mga bata. step 3: read carefully kasi 500 million na tao ang target sa pandemic na ito. step 4: if masama ang pakiramdam mo or nilalagnat ka, best na gawin ay mag init ng tubig or magsuob ka gamit ang kumot para dun lumabas init mo. very important notice: sinusuhulan na ngayon ang mga companies at sa media para maisagawa na ang pang kalahata!ng bakuna. may dalawang component itong future vaccine na hnd pa tinutukoy, secret pa. pero ang pangatlo ay ang "" squalene "". covid = certificate of vaccination identity 1= a for artificial 9= i for intelligence hindi pala ito pangalan ng virus, kung hindi ito'y international plan para makontrol at hindi dumami ang population. nadevelop na ito more than 10 years ago. nailunsad na ito last january 2020 during the last davos. dont get tracked (wag tau sumunod) pagkatapos ng 70 days, ang virus na ito ay hindi na active, kaya nalalampasan natin ito. kaya naman nagreactivate ang virus na ito, kasi humina ang immune natin sa bakuna. ang plano talaga nila i inject sa atin (7 more terrible vaccines) totoong itutulak tayo papuntang impierno. ang target nila, madaming mababawas na tao, mahigit 80% ang mapapasama. ito namang 5g na na install sa mga cities sa buong mundo ay para pahinain ang ating immune system. kaya wag talaga magpa test dahil hindi ito makabubuti. ang mga manufacturer ng tester na ito ay nag sasabi na hindi madetect ang sras\_cov\_2 virus na ito. kung hindi ang walang katapusan na maliliit na virus o wastes cell lamang na nasa microbiata natin, kaya ang result na lumalabas, madami ang positibo pero hnd nila matukoy ang covid virus mismo. kaya ito ang objective nila: una ilabas ang mga bata, kasi hindi nila ma impose ang test sa mga matatanda. sa kabila nito, last may 11 sa france, nag conduct ng mass screening sa lahat ng schools (700k/per week). kaya naman bawat school director ay may pahintulot galing sa rectorate para sa ganun maimpose ang test sa mga bata kahit walang pahintulot sa magulang o wala manlang pasabi. once na ang bata ay nascreen na, saka lang tatawagin ang immediate family para mag pa screen din. obligado ka tanggapin ang screening. kasi kung ayaw mo, ang anak mo ay aalisin sa naturang school. yan ang mangyayari at itoy ay order ng school. tayong walang sakit ay healthy carriers o carriers lang tayo sa little viruses lamang, yan ang laging lumalabas sa mga test....as positive. lahat sila kailangan ganito: paniwalain na ang buong mundo ay may sakit. "" make the whole world believe that the world is sick"". kapag naging positive ka sa test ay matutukoy na isa kang panganib, tulad ng mga hudyo. ang pagtanggi sa screening ay siyang susi para mas maiwasan natin ang pag tatalaga ng bakuna sa atin (wave 2), kapag hindi tumaas ang bilang, ay mas hindi sila papayagan na italaga ang bakuna sa 7 bilyon katao.... sa oras na nabakunahan, lahat tayo ay magkakasakit at manghihina.....at alam nyo na ang kasunod... sa france, ang mga tao doon ay tumatanggi sa screening. ang mensahe ay naiintindihan ng mga mamamayan doon. hindi nila pababalikin ang mga bata sa school. ayaw nila na may mass screening at hindi sila pumapayag sa second wave vaccination. ang mahalagang solution, iligtas ang sangkatauhan. make people understand that they should not allow themselves to be tested. 1. huwag ka magpapahuli 2. huwag ka magpapa test 3. huwag ka mag papabakuna we must fill the walls of facebook, videos, all media spaces with this message. more clear panels! their point of attacks: our children. their strategy: \_ a screening \_ do not give what they lack \_ at least you cannot say that you have not been warned ipakalat ito sa lahat sa lalong madaling panahon kasi ang prosesong ito ay parating na. \[kung alam niyo man kung ano ang illuminati maiintindihan niyo po ng mas maayos. kumikilos na sila at unti unti ng nangyayari ang nakasulat sa bibliya. keep safe every one! god bless y'all. don't forget to pray t hingin ang guidance ni lord.\] ps: sinasagawa na po ang hakbang na ito sa ibang bansa pero hindi sila nagtagumpay kasi hindi pumayag ang mga taong magpaturok. \[share this to everyone!\]",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/htdgbx/ongoing_troll_post_being_shared_around_social/,18 07 2020

Do Youtubers in country get Taxed?,"if they dont, unpopular opinion: i agree with the notion to tax them. 1. ""the government is taking from their creativity"" correct me if i'm wrong but freelancers pay taxes, right? that's mostly creative work - website design, image and video editing, artworks, etc. i work for a company and i am not actually sure how it operates, so let me know. but being a youtuber is equivalent to being a freelancer. if the freelancers are actually paying taxes, i think content creators should not be exempted. 2. ""the government just doesnt use it for good."" while this is true, any person who pays taxes could argue that. it's basically an obligation as a citizen. i'm one of those who advocate for small government with as less tax as possible but given the system we have, i think it's just fair that they also pay taxes just the same as any filipino worker in the country. i think it's just the timing + the pogo issue. ang init ng mata natin sa funds dahil di mo naman talaga maramdaman sa dami ng inutang. but aside from that, i think it's actually time to put this forward. tons of content creators get hundreds and thousands and even millions from youtube and escapes from a 'wage tax' pero ung typical pinoy na nagtatrabaho din naman gets taxed to death. if may mali akong intindi or concept, please let me know.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/hd8duf/do_youtubers_in_country_get_taxed/,21 06 2020

sobrang iniit,"hi im planning to get an ac in my room dahil sobrang iniiit but wondering baka magastusan lang ako due to my room's setup. may ceiling naman but walang heat insulation for sure. i live in a single floored apartment which is directly above the ceiling is roofing na and not even sort of shades like puno or another building kaya ang init talaga kahit makulimlim. nasa 12sqm yung room and it has 2 large glass jaloussie windows at hindi crowded yung area since may sarili xang compound. planning to get an inverter window type or split type since may sariling electric meter naman yung tinitirhan ko. saturday to wednesday: im in an office usually from 6:30am to 3:30pm thursday&friday: rest days ko and usually sa bahay lang ako kaya naiisip ko nang mag aircon haha. thinking of using ac from 4pm up to 4am ( if may pasok). then siguro 18 hours a day with 6hrs off pag rest days ko. isa lang ako nakatira then rice cooker, efan at mobile phone lang gamit ko. ask lang if magiging mataas kaya additional bill ko sa electric consumption given yung setup ng room at planning usage ko? yung 1hp ba na aircon is sapat na sa room especially in split type since 1 hp lang talaga pinakamababa. im thinking of getting a mitsubishi or panasonic split type or lg sa window type. any insight is greatly appreciated especially sa gumagamit na ng inverter aircon na may setup tulad sa akin. still 🤔",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/uev7qo/sobrang_iniit/,29 04 2022
Tagalized - Morgue.,"may nakita akong isang ad sa dyaryo, hindi man ako maka-paniwala at kinilabutan pero nakaka-anyaya ang sinasabi. ""gusto mo bang kumita ng 1000 pesos per night bilang security sa morge? apply na!"" medyo matagal na rin akong walang trabaho at makaka-bayad na rin ako ng upa at makapa-mamumuhay ng maginhawa kung magkataon. kaya naman nag-apply ako kahit medyo nag-dalawang-isip, inaasahan ko nang hindi ako makaka-kuha ng kahit anong sagot mula sa kumpanya. pero wala pang dalawang oras ay may natanggap akong email mula sa employer: ""maraming salamat sa ipinasa mong application form para sa posisyong night guard sa morge. masaya kong ibinabalita na ang mga skills na iyong binanggit ay tugma para sa hinahanap namin sa isang guard at gusto kitang offeran ng isang taong kontrata. kung ika'y sumasang-ayon sa mga kasunduan sa ibaba, maari lamang mag-iwan ka ng signature online via e-signature na naka-lista sa baba at pumunta ka sa (redacted) eksakto alas diyes ngayong gabi. makaka-tanggap ka ng 5000 linggo-linggo na direkta sa iyong bangko."" ngayong gabi? hindi ba masaydong mabilis ang mga pangyayari? pero hindi na ako nag-reklamo o tanong pa. hindi ko alam kung anong aasahan o kung sino ang madadatnan ko doon, kaya sinuot ko na 'yung damit at pantalon ko at agad nagtungo sa nasabing address nang mas maaga sa itinakdang oras. nandoon na ako ng mga alas nwebe kwarenta 'y singko ng gabi at may isang middle aged na lalaki na mukhang nag-tatrabaho sa morge ang bumati sa akin. ""hi, michael, tama? ako nga pala si james."" - doon ay nag-kamayan kami at nag-kangitian - ""alam ko na pinapunta ka dito sa kabila ng maikling abiso, pero sadyang nanganga-ilangan ng bagong gwardiya ang kumpanya na nag-hire sa atin dito agad-agad para ngayong gabi."" ""edi padala ako mula sa security company sa morge n'yo?"" - tanong ko. ""tama ka. nagta-trabaho ka sa isang outsourcing security company at sa alam ko, malaki sila mag-bayad. malay mo, mas maging mataas pa ang posisyon mo sa hinaharap."" - sabay kindat. ""ok. ano naman ang mga trabaho ko dito..."" pagsisimula ko. ""ahh, 'yun. wala naman gaano, siguraduhin mo lang na walang makakapasok."" - lumapit s'ya sa akin at sinabing - ""o labas."" isang maikling katahimikan at nagtinginan kaming dalawa, doon ay napa-ngiti ito at ang sabi: ""de, joke lang. so ayun, tapos na 'yung shift ko, kaya naman mauuna na ako. basta doon ka lang sa office at mag-relax hanggang alas sais ng umaga. doon darating na 'yung kahalili mo."" at doon nga ay umalis na s'ya. umupo ako sa upuan sa may office. akala ko siguro naman walang hindi magandang mangyayari. may papel sa harap ko at habang tinitignan ko ito ay doon ko lang napagtanto na ito ay listahan ng mga rules na specifically naka-asign sa akin. ito ang sabi: sa bagong gwardiya. welcome to the company. sa baba ay ang listahan ng mga rules para sa iyong trabaho: 1. ang una mong dapat gawin ay ang mag-conduct ng full sweep sa buong area para siguraduhin na walang kakaibang mga nangyayari liban sa ordinary (pati sa crypt). important note: kung may katawan man na naka-labas sa chambers sa loob ng crypt, itulak mo lamang ito pabalik. dapat manatili silang nasa-loob sa lahat ng pagkakataon. 2. matapos ang buong sweep, maari ka nang manatili sa loob ng office hanggang matapos ang shift mo. may iba pang mga rules na naka-lista sa baba, pero nag-desisyon akong libutin muna ang buong lugar. medyo may kaliitan ang morge, may isang malaking medical room na halos mapuno ng medical supplies ang loob. pero may sapat na espasyo para sa 2-3 lamesa na puwedeng pag-lagyan ng mga labi. sa loob ng crypt ay may palikuran. nag-desisyon akong unahin na ang pinaka-ayaw kong lugar - 'yung crypt. umalis na ako sa office at binuksan ang solid at napaka-bigat na pinto ng crypt, agad-agad ay sinalubong ako ng napaka-lamig na hangin. sa loob, may dalawang katawan sa gitna ng kwarto at mga chambers sa pader. lahat naman sila ay sarado kaya naman mabilis akong lumabas ng kwarto. habang pabalik ako mula sa bathroom, may nakita akong lalaki na naka lab coat na naka-tayo sa gitna ng medical room. parang may kinakalikot gamit ang mga medical tools malapit sa isang body bag. ""tang... tinakot mo naman ako boss."" - sabi ko. tinignan n'ya ako na parang wala lang at bumalik sa ginagawa nito. ""akala ko umuwi na ang lahat. ako nga pala si michael, bagong gwardiya."" - sabi ko, gaya ng nauna, hindi n'ya ako pinansin. kumaway na ako at umalis pabalik ng office. babasahin ko na sana ulit ang mga rules ng biglang may matinis na tunog akong narinig na para bang may bakal na kumi-kiskis sa isa pang bakal na nag-eecho sa buong building. medyo mahina na ito at parang nang-gagaling sa mga tubo. tumagal din iyon ng ilang segundo at huminto sa kaparehas na segundo. hindi ko na lang pinansin at i-idlip na lang, check ng cell phone. pero medyo tumatagal na ang tunog at habang mas kinikilabutan ako ay unti-unti nang nagbabago ang kanina'y parang bakal na kumi-kiskis sa isa't-isa ay naging... ungol. lumabas ako ng office at tatanungin ko sana 'yung kaninang naka lab coat pero mukhang naka-uwi na s'ya sa mga oras na 'yun. hindi ako sigurado kung saan mismo nang-gagaling ang tunog, pero parang sa may crypt, kaya naman pinuntahan ko ito. 'yung oras na binuksan ko ang pinto ay ang buong building ay nanahimik. huminga ako ng malalim at napansin ko na 'yung isang chambers ay naka-bukas na ng bahagya. tinulak ko ito pabalik at agad-agad na bumalik sa office. nawala na ng tuluyan ang matinis na na para bang ungol na iyon. nagpatuloy ako sa pagbabasa: 3. maari kang matulog sa office, pero dapat handa ka sa mga mangyayari. sleep at your own risk, ika nga nila. matapos nun ay isang napaka-lakas na tunog ang halos mag-patalon sa buong pagkatao ko. ""tulong! palabasin n'yo ako dito!"" - ang boses ay tila nang-gagaling sa mga tubo. tumayo ako habang sobra ang kalabog ng dibdib ko. ""palabasin n'yo ako, hindi ako maka-hinga!"" - paulit-ulit na pagmama-kaawa ng boses na ngayon ay may kasama ng kalabog. binuksan ko ang pintuan ng office at sa hindi malaman na dahilan sa crypt nang-gagaling ang boses. nanginginig, pero binuksan ko ang pinto. ""buhay pa ako, isa itong pagkakamali! tulong!"" - mas lalong lumakas ang boses nung oras na buksan ko ang napaka-bigat at solidong pinto. ""asan ka?!"" - nanginginig akong tumingin sa paligid, habang ang walang humpay na tumatawag ang boses na may kasamang malalakas na kalabog. lumapit ako at unti-unting inilapit ang tenga para maka-siguro na ang bubuksan ko ay ang tamang chamber. ""buhay pa ako! utang na loob! ple----"" ang boses at ang mga kalabog ay daglian na lamang nawala nang biglaan kong binuksan ang isa sa mga chambers at sinalubong ako ng malamig na bangkay ng isang middle-aged na lalaki. tumayo lang ako doon, nakatitig sa bangkay, halos tumigil sa pagtakbo ang isip ko sa kung ano ang mga nangyayari. malinaw na malinaw kong narinig at naramdaman ko ang bawat kalabog nung oras na hinawakan ko ang hawakan ng chamber at para bang may kung sino man na bigla-bigla na lang nagpatigil nito. pinaglalaruan lang ba ako ng aking isipan? tinulak ko ang chamber pabalik at mabilis na umalis doon, nilock ang pinto ng office. iniisip ko na ang pag-aaply sa trabahong 'to ay maaring isang malaking pagkakamali. pakiramdam ko na nababaliw na ako, pero agad ko ring kinumbinse ang sarili ko na nasa ulo ko lang lahat ng 'to. nagpatuloy ako sa pagbabasa ng mg rules: 4. puwede kang mag-patugtog para maibsan ang katahimikan basta't hindi ito makaka-kuha ng atensyon sa labas. 5. kung may marinig kang hindi mo maipaliwanag na ingay galing sa may crypt, 'wag mo na lamang ito pansinin. 6. kung ang mga ingay na 'yun ay naging sigaw ng pagpapanic, gawin ang mga sumusunod: • kung ang mga sigaw ay mula sa babae, 'wag mo pansinin hanggang sa tumigil ito. 'wag na 'wag kang papasok sa loob ng crypt sa mga oras na nangyayari ito sa kahit anong dahilan. • kung ang mga ingay ay mula sa lalaki, hanapin ang pinag-mumulan ng ingay at hatakin ang chamber. dapat huminto na ang ingay pagkatapos mong mabuksan ang chamber. doon na nagtatapos ang page. nilapag ko na ang papel at dahan-dahang inilapat ang likod ko sa upuan. ala una na noon at nag-sisimula na akong antukin. maya-maya pa ay nagsisimula ng pumikit ang aking mga mata ng kusa. nagsisimula na akong mahulog sa panaginip nang biglang may mahigpit akong hawak na naramdaman sa likod ng aking balikat. sa sobrang gulat ko ay agad-agad akong napatayo at sinipa ang upuan. walang tao o kahit ano noong mga oras na iyon. hindi na ako inaantok nung mga oras na 'yun. tahimik na ang buong kapaligiran noon at nagpunta ako sa palikuran. pagbalik ko ay alas tres na at halos handa na akong tapusin ang shift ko dito. napagisip-isip ko na hindi na rin masama para sa isang libo, hanggang tinalikod ko ang papel na may mga rules at napansin kong may naka-sulat pa sa likod: 7. lahat ng staff ay lalabas o dapat nasa labas na ng building bago mag alas diyes ng gabi, kaya kung may makita kang lalaki na naka lab coat during your shift, 'wag na 'wag sa kahit ano mang sitwasyon na subukan mong makipag-usap sa kanya. paulit-ulit-ulit kong binasa ang rule ng limang beses, pero wala pa ring nagbabago sa naka-sulat. may mahinang katok sa pinto ng office. tinignan ko ito at sa likod ng salamin ay nakita ko ang lalaking naka lab coat naka-ngiti sa akin. alas kwatro 'y media na at patuloy pa rin s'ya sa pagkatok. sa mga magta-tanong, hindi ko na ho alam kung saan ko ito nakuha dahil 2018 ko pa po ito tinagalog. nakita ko lang na naka-save pa rin sa note ng selpon ko. salamat and ang init. tangina.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/t8j464/tagalized_morgue/,7 03 2022
[Story time] Things I Notice As a First Time Driver,"magpapalit na ako ng work thanks to the ccp virus at mapapadpad ako sa makati. hindi ko naman need pumunta doon lagi, pero for moments that need to, mahirap na mag rely sa public transpo at mahirap na din makipagsapalaran sa grab during rush hours. so i made time to learn how to drive. may kotse naman kami at motor. since i know naman mag motor, learning how to drive a car is next. so off to lto to get a student permit. * first annoyance, kupal yung guard na nakapusap ko. pinapabalik ako bukas kasi may quota na daw sila. not exactly sure why, since hindi naman ako mag-eexam doon. just got my medical and came back tomorrow. need daw as early as 4am (wtf!!!) na nakapila. surely, gawin nila parang dfa yung appointment nila, ndi na need mangyari eto. * anyway, went early around 7 am. nakuha ko naman permit shy of lunch. kupal yung guard, for exaggerating. now that's out of the way. puwede na ako mag-drive with supervision. best option ko is via driving school since designed sila for teaching people how to drive. i applied for a manual lesson kahit automatic ang kotse namin, so that i can drive both kinds of cars. fortunately, mabait yung nagturo sa akin at yung last 2 days ay sa automatic na ako since automatic naman kasi yung kotse naming. basically i get a discount 😂 so while driving, eto ang napansin ko: * liberating pala magdrive. kaya gets ko na kung bakit may mga tao na mahilig sa kotse. i was thinking of buying a motorcycle for commute. pero napapaisip ako na kotse na lang, given the convenience and the feeling of being comfortable inside an ac rather than being boiled sa init. * driving with bikers (both peddal and mannual) is never wracking. i bike to work for almost 5 years na. now i see why maiinit ang ulo ng mga drivers kapag may bike na kasalubong. more so yung mga walang pake. * medyo forgiving pa ang roads ngayon since walang mga jeep. pero i imagine mas magiging annoying kung babalik na sila. * more of an art ang pagdrarive. yes, may science para paandarin ang kotse. pero yung decision making at how you decide on what to do sa road. ang mentality ko is more of waiting for the object in front of me to finish rather than iwasan siya. something i practice when i bike. so i need the experience to calculate kung puwede ko ba iwasan eto or hintayin na lang. need more time driving to establish that. now that's out of the way, ang next problem ko is getting a non-pro. since wala pang 2 weeks since i had mine. need to wait for 31 days para makapag-apply for non-pro. since pumunta ako sa only lto na malapit sa area namin na puwede ka mag-apply ng non-pro. para makapag start, need ko pumila ng 4am para lang ma entertain since my quota sila. that's bullshit. again, yung parang dfa sana gawin nila, edi hindi na kailangan pahirapan pa ang taong bayan. yes, driving is a privilege. pero wag namann gawin pasakit ang pagkuha. anyway, i know this is frowned upon. so binigyan ako ng option na i bypass ang quota shit na iyan. besides the extra that i need to pay, ang gusto lang ng lto na kausap ng contact ko is i pasa ko yung exam nila. the driving practical (since nag driving school na ako) and the medical are already waived. basta alam ko ang batas at ang rules of the road, bibigyan na nila ako ng non-pro. that's good for me. hindi niya nilalabag yung principles ko na cheating. i still need to exert effort pa din. yung pasakit lang na pumila ng sobrang aga ang ayoko. anyway, yun lang naman. just want to share kasi baong life experience sa akin. 😂",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/h0rhc1/story_time_things_i_notice_as_a_first_time_driver/,11 06 2020
"alex, tanghaling tapat ng sabado, 2021","(any review for this is very-very much appreciated. i'm an aspiring writer po and i just launched a passion project anthology, isa po ito sa mga kwento) &#x200b; **chairman** ngayon ko lang naranasan ‘to sa tagal ko nang nanunungkulan sa barangay. isama mo na sa mga karanasang ‘yon ang lahat ng away mag-asawa, suntukan ng mga lasing, at mga batang ginagahasa sa bukiran. pero eto… ngayon ko lang napansin na buong araw ko na palang hinihimas ang rosaryong nakasabit sa leeg ko. maya’t-maya ko pa hinahalikan at binubulungan na sana’y wag mangyari sa pamilya ko ang nakita ko kanina. naririnig ko pa rin ang sigaw ni cecil, kumare’t-kapitbahay namin, tanghaling tapat ng sabado, kung saan ang tanghalian sa buong kalsada nami’y naantala dahil sa kanyang nakakakilabot na sigaw. sa ilalim ng nagbabagang init ay nagsitakbuhan kami upang sumaklolo. kinailangan ko pang iwanan ang tinola ni misis at ang isang basong softdrinks na nilalanguyan pa dalawang yelo nang ako’y tumakbo papunta sa bahay ni cecil. ngayo’y hindi pa rin ako kumakain. sa totoo nga’y hindi pa ako nakakaranas ng gutom. hindi ko pa ata kaya. sa bahay ni cecil ay dinatnan namin ang katawan ng panganay ni cecil na si joe na nakaratay sa braso ng kanyang bunsong kapatid na si alex, sa sahig ng kanilang sala. sa leeg ni joe ay nakabaon ang basag na bote na ginamit ni alex na balot na balot sa dugo ng kanyang kapatid. agad ang kapit at halik ko sa aking rosaryo nang makita ko ang imahe; na parang sinaunang obra na naglalahad ng malagim na kwento. pero ano ang kwento neto? hanggang ngayon ay wala pa rin kaming ideya kung bakit. magmula sa pagsigaw ni cecil ng, “anong nangyari?! anak, anong nangyari?!” sa tulalang alex na nakatitig sa dilat na mga mata ni joe, hanggang sa pagpunta namin dito sa aking opisina sa barangay, ay wala pa rin kaming makuhang rason mula sa bakit. sa isang maliit na kwarto sa aking opisina’y pinaupo ko muna si alex. tulala at sinusubukang burahin ang dugo sa kanyang mukha gamit ang duguan ring damit n’ya. hinainan ko ng isang bote ng softdrinks at tatlong pandesal mula pa sa agahan namin kanina si alex, na agad namang n’yang kinain ng walang pag-aalinlangan. dito na nagsimulang gumapang ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod. isang kilabot na hindi ko maipaliwanag, habang pinapanood ko si alex na walang awat sa pagkain, habang ako’y hindi ko pa rin magawang matakam sa masarap na lutong nag-aabang sa’kin sa bahay. “alex,” marahan kong sinabi. “ba’t mo ginawa ‘yun?” tumingin lamang sa’kin si alex, patay na mga mata, bibig na mabagal ang nguya. at sa kanyang paglunok ay walang mga salitang bumalik sa’kin. hindi ko alam kung bakit pero bigla kong naalala si jefferson, isang tricycle driver dito sa’min. dalawang taon na ang nakakalipas nang mapatay n’ya ang isang dayo na nakaaway n’ya sa kalsada. nangyari ‘to nang kamuntikan n’yang makasalpukan ang sasakyan ng dayo, at nang nahinto silang dalawa’y nagkasagutan muna sila bago mapikon si jefferson. hinampas n’ya ng bakal na tubo ang dayo. hindi na raw n’ya napigilan dahil sa mga mapanglait na mga salitang tinawag sa kanya. bobo, unggoy, uling, mababa. labing-isang beses paulit-ulit na hinampas ni jefferson sa ulo ang dayo, at sa sobrang lakas ng bawat hampas ay may parte na ng utak na lumabas dito. sa prisinto’y naalala ko si jefferson, iyak nang iyak at humihingi ng tawad dahil sa nangyari. hindi makakain, hindi rin makatulog. nilamon na s’ya ng konsensya n’ya, at ang konsensya n’ya ang tumulak sa kanya na agawin ang baril ng isa sa mga pulis na nagbabantay, at iputok sa kanyang sariling ulo. nasaktan si jefferson, nagalit, at di nakapagpigil. naintindihan ko ang kwento ‘nun. pero bakit hindi ko maintindihan ‘to? alam kong magkasundo ang magkapatid na ‘to. alam ko kung ga’no sila kalapit sa isa’t-isa. kaya pa’no nangyari ‘to? ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod ay gumagapang paakyat hanggang sa aking dibdib, tila ba kumakapit ng mahigpit. pasikip nang pasikip at medyo nahihirapan akong huminga. ang kakaibang pakiramdam na ‘to’y tumitindi habang nanatiling tahimik at nakatitig lamang sa’kin si alex. biglang iniabot ni alex ang kanyang kamay at dito tumalon na ang puso ko. napaatras ako sa aking kinauupuan, at mabilisan kong hinugot ang aking rosaryo mula sa pagkakatago nito sa aking damit. itinutok ko ito kay alex, na walang ibang kibo kun’di ang kunin ang bote ng softdrinks na nasa harapan n’ya. mas bumilis pa ang pagkatok sa aking dibdib, na para bang kamuntikan na kong mamatay. habang si alex nama’y pinapanood lang ako habang patuloy ang kanyang pag-inom. wala nga ata talagang mangyayari, at nang maramdaman ko kung gaano katahimik ang kwarto’y kumalma na ako. bakit sa dulo ng utak ko’y hinihiling ko na may sapi o di kaya’y isang demonyo talaga ang kaharap ko, at sa presensya ng aking rosaryo’y masasaktan s’ya. kahit anong kakaiba. kahit ano basta magkaroon lang ng eksplenasyon ang nangyari. pero siguro’y kakaiba na rin ang ikinikilos ng bata. at siguro nga’y mas dapat talaga akong matakot sa buhay kaysa sa patay. **cecil** “saan ba ko nagkulang?” tanong ni aling cecil sa mga kumare n’yang nakapalibot sa kanya sa masikip na opisina ni chairmain. napapaligiran din s’ya ng makukulay na mga pamaypay na hindi sabay-sabay ang pagaspas sa harap n’ya; nilulunod si aling cecil sa hangin. ang kanyang mukha nama’y tila ba isang rebulto ng santo kung punas-punasan ng mga panyo. “hindi ko pa rin maintindihan,” dugtong n’ya. “hindi naman ako nagkulang sa aruga. pareho ko namang pinapakita sa kanila na pantay ang pagmamahal ko sa kanila.” tuyo na ang mga mata ni aling cecil, ngunit tila ba hindi pa rin tapos ang kanyang pag-iyak. “hindi sila nag-aaway. hindi ko man lang narinig na nagtalo silang dalawa. o kung may pagtatalo man, malamang sa malamang maliit na bagay lang ‘yun. hindi yung ikakamatay mo!” isang labi ng lumapit sa tenga ni aling cecil, “alam mo tingin ko, baka inggit ‘yan. kasi si joe lang may trabaho sa kanilang dalawa, di ba? tapos si alex, wala pa rin sa kolehiyo. nag-aaral pa rin. sigurado akong ‘yun ang dahilan.” isa pang labi ang lumapit sa kabilang tenga naman ni aling cecil, “baka napikon na. kasi di ba halos s’ya na sa lahat ng gawaing bahay? baka pakiramdam n’ya porke’t mas malaki ambag ng kapatid n’ya , alila na s’ya neto.” isang labi naman na kaharap ni aling cecil ang nagsabing, “baka nagbabait-baitan lang kasi nga si joe ang halos sumasalo sa mga bayarin, pati sa pag-aaral n’ya. pero galit talaga s’ya, kasi baka naman may pagkakataong mas nabibigyang-atensyon si joe kahit hindi n’yo napapansin. kasi halimbawa uuwi s’yang pagod galing sa trabaho, syempre di n’yo maiwasang alagaan, pagsilbihan.” sa gitna ng mga labing ito’y si aling cecil, at ang ideyang unti-unting nabubuo dahil sa mga sinasabi ng mga labi sa kanya. “siguro,” sabi n’ya. “siguro nga.” **abbie** ang pangalan n’ya’y abbie. social worker daw s’ya. pagpasok n’ya’y agad bumungad sa’kin ang asul na bra sa ilalim ng dilaw na blouse nang tapatan ito ng liwanag mula sa bintanang katabi ko. sa kanyang pagtali ng buhok ay nakita kong basang-basa na ang kanyang kili-kili at kumikinang na sa pawis ang kanyang leeg. “alex?” sabi n’ya habang maya’t-mayang tinutulak ng kanyang daliri ang salamin n’yang dumudulas sa kanyang matangos na ilong. “bakit di mo ikwento muna sa’kin ang nangyari bago tayo umalis dito?” pasensya ka na, abbie. hindi ko nagawang sabihin kay chairman, na kilala pa mandin namin. hinding-hindi ko rin masasabi sa’yo. walang ibang maglalahad ng nangyari kun’di ang mga taong nais magbigay kahulugan dito, kasi kung ako tatanungin kung bakit, sa totoo lang, hindi ko rin alam ang isasagot. may nabasag akong bote sa kusina kanina, at sa pagpulot ko nito’y pumasok sa isip ko ang isang udyok. yung tipo ng udyok kapag nasa mataas kang lugar, at bigla mo na lang gustong itulak ang kasama mo. pero alam mong hindi ito dapat gawin, at kakapit ka pa nang mas mahigpit sa kanila para masiguro mong hindi ito mangyayari. ang udyok na ito’y nagsabi sa’kin na isaksak ko kay kuya ang basag na bote. at nalaman ko na lang na totoo na pala ang lahat nang dumapo sa aking balat ang mainit na dugo ni kuya. nahinto lang ako nang maramdaman ko ang buto sa leeg n’ya at nang marinig kong nabibilaukan na s’ya sa kanyang sariling dugo. hindi ko pa rin alam kung bakit. sana, tulad ng iniisip ni chairman, ay nasapian na nga lang ako. pero nakita ko ang lahat, andun ako. hindi ko lang alam na totoo pala ang lahat. namatay si kuya joe sa wala. at hindi ko matanggap na wala. normal lang sana ang sabado namin. tahimik. nanonood lang si kuya ng tv, naglilinis ako sa kusina. si nanay nama’y namamalengke ng pananghalian namin. bicol express daw ang lulutuin n’ya. puta, sinira ko ang araw. gusto kong umiyak dahil hindi na kami babalik sa salo-salo namin. “alex?” muling tawag ni abbie. “gusto kong malaman kung bakit. tayong dalawa lang. kaibigan mo ko dito. hinding-hindi ko ‘to sasabihin sa nanay mo, sa mga kapitbahay n’yo. may mga naririnig ako sa labas na dahil daw sa inggit? totoo ba ‘to? sa inggit nga? magmula nang dinala ako ni chairman dito sa maliit na kwartong ito’y napagpasyahan kong manahimik na lang sa nangyari. sa ngayo’y nilalabanan ko ang mga luha, nilalabanan ko ang panginginig ng aking bibig, at ang mga salitang gustong lumabas mula sa’kin. dapat mukhang hindi ko pinagsisisihan. dapat mukha akong galit. para naman mabigyang halaga, mabigyan ng ibig-sabihin ang pagkamatay ni kuya joe. dapat tinatatak ko sa utak ko na dapat lang! dapat lang sa kanya ang nangyari. dapat hindi ako bibigay. dahil kapag natalo ako, mamatay talaga sa wala si kuya. “sige, kung ayaw mong magkwento, ako muna. kasi naalala ko ‘tong isang batang babae at ang tatay n’yang abusado. tatay n’yang lasinggero. tatay n’yang isang beses s’yang hinipuan sa kanyang sariling kwarto at pinilit. ampon ang batang ‘yon, at tatay-tatayan n’ya lang etong umaabuso sa kanya. takot na takot ang bata dahil pakiramdam n’ya isang gabi’y papatayin na lang s’ya bigla neto. kaya naman isang gabi, nang bigla s’yang pinuntahan ng kanyang tatay upang pagsamantalahan ulit, sinasaksak ito ng bata gamit ang lapis sa mata, sa leeg, at sa dibdib.” kumuha ng panyo si abbie. sa kanyang paggalaw ay muling sumisilip ang kanyang bra sa likod ng blouse na parang mga batang naglalaro sa likod ng kurtina. “masarap sa pakiramdam, pero pumapatay pa rin s’ya ng tao. ilan taon n’yang dinibdib ‘yun. hanggang ngayon nararamdaman pa rin n’ya ang mga kamay ng tatay n’ya sa kanyang ari. sa kanyang dibdib. ilang taon bago n’ya matanggap ang ginawa n’ya. ngayon, medyo mahirap pa ring ikwento, pero kahit papaano’y kaya ko na. nangyari na kasi.” para bang may sumuntok sa aking dibdib nang marinig ko ‘to. bigla kong tinanggal ang aking paningin sa kanyang bra, at sa paggalaw ng aking mga mata’y bigla kong naramdaman ang pamumuo ng mga luha. “ayos lang, alex. pero andito lang ako. aalagaan ka muna namin. tapos pag handa ka na, makikinig ako. kahit pakonte-konte pa, ayos lang. aantayin kong mabuo ang kwento mo.” bumibilis bigla ang tibok ng puso ko. lalong nanginginig ang aking labi. at biglang pumasok si kuya sa isip ko, tumatakbo papalayo sa akin. mga bata pa kami, at hinahabol ko s’ya. “alex?” kuya wag kang lumayo! “alex?” kuya dito ka lang! kailangan kita dito! “sige, ayusin na natin pag-alis mo.” at parang isang batang nadapa sa semento, dito na walang awat na tumulo ang luha sa aking mga mata. “alex?” “hindi ko rin alam… hindi… ko rin alam. sorry, kuya! sorry! hindi ko rin alam kung bakit! patayin n’yo na lang ako! hindi ko alam anong nangyari! hindi ko na kaya!” lumalabo na ang aking paningin, pero kahit ga’no kalabo ang aking mga mata’y kitang-kita ko ang gulat at takot sa mukha ni abbie. pasensya ka na, kuya.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/nlygsa/alex_tanghaling_tapat_ng_sabado_2021/,27 05 2021
I grouped my unfollowed friends in facebook,"i managed to refrain myself from posting political stuffs sa facebook awhile ago but i snapped after the chain of stupid actions/inactions of this administration. i did some shares and status which is fine but i don't like me commenting on dds posts lol. di ko napiligilan mag comment on 2 of my friend's post di ko kinaya. so i unfollowed all my dds and neutral kuno friends since i can't manage to deactivate my facebook since we use it for office communication. so i grouped them out as a form of distraction dahil to be honest medyo nasstress ako sa disappointment. **santong kabayos** they post bible verses every now and then, active sa church, oh god is mightier than the virus! then for some reason they wholeheartedly support this self confessed murderer piece of crap. like what? 5th sa utos ng diyos “thou shalt not kill.” the irony. **the scrubs** kung hindi dds memes ang laman ng timeline, mobile legends posts naman. they don't event watch news or watch the president's address the nation. you'll know kasi late night nag prerescon si digong dahil sa sturdiness then they won't post/react til the next day. they don't even bother to get updated about the news and what their idol was doing. **the disappointments** disappointments kasi these are the people that i look up to. some are my relatives, colleagues or someone i consider my mentor. i am sure they are smart and competent enough to have a logical point of view sa nangyayari but for some reason they chose not to. i don't know if pride or personal agenda pero sayang. these are the people i really don't want to have conflict with because of our colliding political beliefs. **mitläufer** neutral daw or just does not like politics at all. you'll always see them post about unity or nationwide cooperation and complains that their newsfeed being 'toxic' dahil sa anti government rants. some mock the people posting complaints saying it like ""royal rambolan"". some part of me thinks na these people are dds but ashamed to be called one or maybe mali ako and they just do not care. **the mindless sheeps** somehow like the scrubs but more competent and active. i usually see them change opinions based on what the president say. for example, last year obosen ang mga adik, tuwang tuwa nung 20 pesos lang budget ng chr and thinks that human rights just helps the criminals and galit sa mga chinese. then last month when duterte does not want to halt flights from china biglang naging mga human rights adovate ang mga gago. copy paste pa ng chinese guy sa condo at mcdo. ka init ng ulo. there's a lot of example but i'll reach the max text for this control box if enumerate natin. &#x200b; this my list for now. you can add if have something in mind.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ftojfe/i_grouped_my_unfollowed_friends_in_facebook/,2 04 2020
"#OursDuterte: President Rodrigo Roa Duterte addressed the nation yesterday(April 6, 2020)","#oursduterte: president rodrigo roa duterte addressed the nation tonight (april 6, 2020). - report of the office of the president to congress | bayanihan act - possible realignment of the 2020 budget - help for the middle class aside from the social amelioration program for the low income families - inclination to extend the lockdown to april 30 1. resources under the bayanihan act have been mobilized. our most vulnerable citizens, must receive government assistance immediately. 2. alam ko we shouldn’t just zero in sa poorest of the poor. valid ang suggestion ni cavite governor remulla. pag may mapulot tayo. ok tayo. the economy is on a standstill. what we are spending now is reserves natin. etong pera na ito nakatago ito ni secretary dominguez kaya may panggastos tayo ngayon. 3. yung poorest of the poor, eto yung walang kita sa isang araw, di na makakain. or wala talagang trabaho. what is really sad is that the rainy day has arrived in our generation. di natin ito gusto. 4. di ako makatulog. nag iisip ako buong gabi. abutan na ako daybreak. 5. the 100 billion for one month or the 270 billion for two months is not enough. i am calling the secretary of finance mag generate na ng pera. 6. we are exploring options to adjust the earlier budget (the 2020 general appropriations act), realign or cancel ibang projects kasi hindi pwede magutom ang tao. 7. hindi lang ako. lahat ng leaders sa buong mundo, ito ang problema. wala ng income ang gobyerno. lahat gastos. ang gobyerno cannot print so much money. ang value lang ng economy ang pwede natin iprint. 8. kung makinig kayo, you’d be able to understand my paradigm. 9. i ask the utmost cooperation of the public, especially our brothers and sisters who are hit most by the pandemic. 10. devil and the deep blue sea ako. kung ipagbawal ko, di makalabas. di makakain yan. pero kakalat ang covid. kaya do not go out, lock yourselves in your house. 11. ikaw duterte, bakit di mo ito ma solve? di matakot sa bunganga mo? wala kang magawa nito? ang covid is science. period. the reason why we are ordering you to stay inside the house is science. period. kung mabaril lang itong virus, tapos na sana ito. 12. umiinit ang ulo ko na pinuputol ang sinasabi ko. i am laying out the predicate. 13. pati ang gobyerno, desperado na. kanina nagising ako mga 3am. my god is the true god. ang diyos ko is god the father. 14. i would like to be honest, ang 270 billion pesos na estimate ay hindi talaga tatagal yan. mauubos kasi walang kita ang gobyerno. kung sa bisaya pa, ang tubig mo hubas pud. 15. intindihin niyo ako. kung may pera lang. yung sige sabi na corruption, ano naman gahawin ko sa pera sa remaining years ko. i turned 75 last month. 16. stop it. yung mga tao na binabaliktad ang sinasabi ko. hindi nila alam, ang binabasa ako ang constitution. ang batas. mga trying to be smart aleck. you do not know your law. 17. let us take this problem one at a time. ngayon buwan na ito, tutok muna tayo dito. we are trying to perfect this. 18. etong mga #oustduterte, patayin si duterte, buti na lang andyan si atty. pamatong sa facebook. he declared himself as president. tama siya. he can solve the problem in 3 weeks in the entire planet earth. 😂 19. i agree sa letter ni governor remulla. i know the political horizon of the country. kung maari lang isali ko sila. but can they be included in the 270 billion? hindi pa sa ngayon. 20. the solution to our problem, is a vaccine. the experts in infectious diseases are better to solve this. hindi kaming mga abogado. our resources are finite, not infinite. there’s not enough money. 21. ang pang kontra lang sa problema niyo ngayon, stay home. etong veerus, mahawaan kayo. lalaki ang problema natin lalo. 22. hindi ko alam kung hanggang kelan kayo sa bahay. hindi ko alam saan ako kukuha ng pera kasi hindi ko alam kung may bibili pa sa ibebenta natin. 23. i am forced to say this, what is at stake. parang kadena de amor ito. 24. kelan ito matapos duterte ang paghirap mo sa amin? anytime sabihin ni pamatong o ng military, baba na ako. 25. this being the holy week, i call on everyone to unite and pray. 26. baka mali ako, baka yung init has something to do with it. yung tropical climate makatulong. 27. we are inclined to extend the lockdown up to april 30. tingnan natin. pero for the meantime, mag double time kami para mabigyan din ng tulong ang middle class. 28. pag bumagsak ang gobyerno, bagsak tayo lahat. 29. next time i talk to you, sana mag improve na ang situation. kaya natin ang covid-19! mabuhay ang pilipinas! 👊🏼🇵🇭 for more info on the government’s fight against covid-19, log on to www.covid19.gov.ph.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/fwc9c7/oursduterte_president_rodrigo_roa_duterte/,7 04 2020

Sabi ko sa tatay ko iaahon ko siya sa hirap di niya alam ilalagay ko siya sa home for the agents,"i know i know sobrang harsh na gagawin ko ito sa tatay ko pero may reasoning din naman ako na gagawin ko to sa tatay ko, ever since nung 5 years old ako ginawa na akong golden child ng pamilya ko, na kung saan ok lang naman at first pero kung magkakamali ako doon na nagsisimula ang abuse both verbal at physical, sinasabihan akong tanga, inutil, walang mararating etc... habang ginagamitan ako ng belt, hanger, walis tambo, etc.. nag stop lang yung abuse nung nagannulment na both parents ko, nakatira kami ng kapatid ko kasama tatay at lola ko na kung saan nagstop naman ung physical abuse pero maslumala ang verbal abuse, pagkatapos naman ng verbal abuse kung sa tingin niya naman na ok na or wala na ang galit niya tinatanong niya kung magbibigay ba daw ako ng bahay o iahon siya sa hirap pagtapos ko mag aral (kahit na shs palang ako), tungo nalang ako ng tungo kasi wala ako magagawa pero alam ko naman sa plano ko pagkatapos ko mag-aral ilalagay ko siya sa home for the aged, kasi whats the point kung habang buhay mong dinamdam lahat ng sakit at puot tapos magbibigay pa ako ng pera at bahay sa kaniya, edi ako din kakawa since alam ko ako lahat bibili nun, pero then again sa liit na space sa utak ko na baka masama un or something at bigyan nalang siya ng 2nd chance, di ko narin alam gagawin ko. tldr: father is verbally and physically abusive to me, wants money/house if i get money, i say yes yet is planning to put him in the home for the aged edit: sa mga taong nagtataka bakit sinabi ko home for the aged ay home for the agents is due to how ung mga matatanda noon sinasabing home for the agents ever since kahit sa school so inaakala ko parehas parin sa terminology up until now and thank you sa corrections at memes about sa terminology ko sa home for the aged.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/xhzulx/sabi_ko_sa_tatay_ko_iaahon_ko_siya_sa_hirap_di/,19 09 2022

Woes of a Kakampink OFW,"last year i had a falling out with my family. very vocal kasi ako na kakampink ako. i was the only kakampink in the family, aside from my 14-year old niece. but she can't vote, so her posts about leni were always the butt of the joke in the family group chat. 'ang bata bata mo pa, akala mo naman may alam ka!', they would say. i would post leni's advocacies and they would put 'haha' reacts to it. hinayaan ko lang. election came and went, bbm won, sara won, but i never shut up. post pa rin ako nang post sa facebook calling out how they blatantly steal from the filipino people. they would comment, pero hindi na ako pumapatol, 'haha' react na lang pabalik tutal ganoon lang din naman ang ginagawa nila kapag wala na silang masabi to defend bbm. pero hindi na ako nakapagtimpi when they told me to shut up because i was not living in the philippines. hindi na ako nakatira sa pilipinas, pero ramdam na ramdam ko pa rin ang hirap dahil nagpapadala ako sa kanila. it's as if nawalan ako ng karapatan dahil wala ako doon, pero ako naman ang gumagastos para sa kanila? 'manahimik ka na, wala ka naman dito!', pero pagdating ng bills ng kuryente, wifi at tubig, sa akin hihingi. 'manahimik ka, di mo naman alam mga nagagawa ni bbm dito!', pero kapag wala na silang makain, sa akin tatakbo. 'shut up na, sa ibang bansa ka naman nagttrabaho!', kahit philippines pa rin ang hawak kong passport at pilipino ako. i'm in the process of acquiring a new citizenship in a year. hindi na ako makapaghintay hindi maging pilipino. para manahimik na talaga ako. dumating sa punto na php 200k ang naipadala ko sa isang buwan sa kanila. yung pang grocery at pambayad ng bills, suddenly, kulang na kulang na. pero shut up daw ako kasi wala naman daw ako sa pilipinas. edit: naoverwhelm ako sa dami ng comments. - why would they bite the hands that feed them? gaya nga ng sabi ko, do not underestimate people's audacity. it's the 'anak ka lang namin, wala ka dito sa mundong ibabaw kung hindi dahil sa amin' mentality. - bakit nagpapadala ka pa? my 8-yr old sister isn't independent. malaki ang padala ko kasi may sakit siya and kailangan ng meds. sinubukan ko na yung sa kanya lang padaanin pero ang sagot eh 'di ako marunong magwithdraw', 'di ko alam yan eh'. - you get what you tolerate. takot akong maging mag-isa sa buhay, probably, dahil alam kong kapag cinut-off ko sila, lahat, including extended family, damay. siguro di pa ako handa maging mag-isa kaya takot ako magcut-off. may matitira naman, mga pinsang bukas mag-isip pero ilan ilan lang din. once i get my new citizenship, kukunin ko na yung mga kapatid ko (i have a brother na mas matanda pero ignorante rin; kukunin ko pa rin siya dahil naniniwala naman akong with proper education mamumulat sila sa kung ano ang tama). edit 2: some shit went down earlier kasi sinunod ko yung isang comment dito na ipost to sa facebook. i will update kapag tapos na kami sa confrontation. ilang oras na kami nagchchat and i tried to call them, nirereject at sa chat na lang daw kami mag-usap dahil baka raw di nila ako matancha. hahahahahahaha.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/16p0yni/woes_of_a_kakampink_ofw/,22 09 2023

Creatures of Philippine Lower Mythology,"reading this book it details the physical attributes, magic and power, capabilities and domiciles of philippine lower mythological beings like demons (kapre, tikbalang) aswangs, witches, mermaids and engkantos. the book taps the history of pre-colonial philippines. the book also explore the comprehensive effects of these creatures in the daily life of filipinos. positive man or negative. while some filipinos believe in the existence of these creatures, some may not. i personally believe that science should triumph over superstitious or primitive beliefs. that everything has a logical explanations be it sa pagkalampag ng bubong (dahil dinapuan ng aswang ang bubong) or itim na aso na umaaligid sa bahay ng may sakit. however, nakakaaliw din magbasa or makinig ng mga stories tungkol sa aswang, mangkukulam, engkanto, tikbalang and etc. so bilang malapit na ang halloween at bilang batang pinanganak ng early 90s na part ng school life yung pinagkwekwentuhan ang mga kwentong kakatakutan kapag ganitong buwan…drop your stories here (narinig man or naexperience) about these creatures of the night.",https://i.redd.it/15237my7qysb1.jpg,8 10 2023
So my dad didn’t pass the bar exam… again,"this was his 6th attempt. he’s been studying for this ever since i was in mom’s womb (i’m now 18 years old). he’s reaching his late 40s and i feel he doesn’t have any plans to retake anymore. nakakalungkot lang isipin ‘yung dami ng sacrifices niya at namin para dito. the huge amount of time, effort, and money dedicated and parang napunta lang sa wala. i was in tears as my mom broke the news to me kanina through the phone. she then passed the phone to my dad para mabigyan ko ng comfort and naramdaman ko ‘yung sakit na tinitimpi niya from the other side of the screen as he was talking to me. “it’s okay lang. instead of me, ikaw nalang, ate. you’ll be a lawyer soon, right?” he joked, trying to make light of the situation. pero later on nung umuwi si mama, ikinwento niya how dad just wanted nalang daw to lay down, rest, and to try to swallow the news. and yet he couldn’t since may rally pa siyang kailangan i-attend and madami pa siyang work for the day. my mom told me how much it hurt her to go to her office, smile, and congratulate her officemates who passed the bar as if an hour ago hindi siya umiyak for her own husband who failed. they both didn’t have enough time to sulk about the situation. kaya ang tindi nung breakdown ni mama the moment she got home. she really let it all out to the point na napa-iyak na rin ako ulit. sobrang sakit pala kapag feel mo nagawa mo na lahat pero hindi ka pa rin maka-succeed. when i was born, he would come home late at night because of his studies. when my little brother was born, he had to travel to manila and study in a dorm for months, tapos when he came home muntik na siyang maluha kasi yung umiiyak lang na newborn nung umalis siya, nakakapagsabi na ng “papa”. he really wanted this so bad, for nearly two long decades. but with a 72% passing rate and he still couldn’t get in, i guess some things really just aren’t meant to be. kakauwi ni papa ngayon, and he told me he’s fine na daw and he’s just glad na at least may marangal pa rin siyang trabaho kahit na hindi siya makakalagay ng “atty” sa pangalan niya. anyways, that’s the end of my day. congratulations pa rin sa mga nakapasa! patuloy pa rin ang buhay. my dad will still continue to serve the locals of the municipality if he gets re-elected for his third term as a councilor. here’s to a future na kulay rosas! magandang hatinggabi, pilipinas",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/u21rrf/so_my_dad_didnt_pass_the_bar_exam_again/,12 04 2022

[Trigger Warning] Would you Agree on Legalizing Assisted Suicide or Euthanasia in the Philippines?,"around the time of pnoy's death, a friend from belgium sent me one of the rare good news i have in my life - legal ang euthanasia/assisted suicide sa kanila and sa netherlands, regardless of reason - kahit pa wala ka kahit anong sakit, basta gustuhin mo, their respective health ministries will assist you with the reason. parang gumaan pakiramdam mo since di ko na need mamoblema sa lovelife or kung ano pa man sa buhay kasi may ""way out"" na. di ko na need mag-alala lakasan loob ko tumalon sa manila bay or humarap sa isang .45 caliber or kung saan ko pde isabit sarili ko pag nasaktan pa uli sa pag-ibig (un na lang methods na di ko pa nasusubukan eh). ang kailangan ko na lang gawin is to convince the belgian or dutch governments to administer the service to a foreigner. pagtapos - isang lethal injection lang, tapos na, wala na akong iisipin kahit anong problema. downvote if you wish pero i am currently preparing for this under the condition na pag wala nareto sa akin kinakapatid, nanay or bosses ko, gora na ako mamaalam sa mismong 40th birthday ko, 10 years and 10 days from now. i just wish may ganitong service sa pinas na pde i-avail kahit wala kang malalang sakit or any ailment tapos i-restrict na lang ung mga may dependents na invalids or minors. i've been talking to people from different sides of the moral and political spectrum (yes, even mga apolo10s) - marami dito ang kinoconsider ang euthanasia or assisted suicide to end their problems. nakakafrustrate nga lang that the process might take 8 years or more pag wala kang terminal illness and it costs around 2k+ euros. pipigilan ka kasi nila every step of the process pero according to rumors - if you could piss your psychiatrists enough, possible mapabilis ung process to 2 years or less. oh well, enjoy enjoy ko na lang muna ung time na natitira (kahit nakakadissappoint national and economic situation natin ngayon), mabilis lang siguro 10 years. sooner or later naman, i am being cremated na, wala nang iisipin. mom need not worry - may younger brother pa naman ako and i am currently saving up funds na maiiwan ko sa kanila. ok na option na ito kaysa tumandang binata or end up with someone na ayaw mo naman.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ws801h/trigger_warning_would_you_agree_on_legalizing/,19 08 2022
Kasalan mo ba na isinilang at lumaki kang mahirap? O kasalanan ito ng magulang mo?,"hindi kasalanan na isinilang ka na mahirap kasi wala ka namang choice nung bata ka. totoong mahirap maging mahirap. lalo na ang lumaki kang mahirap. pero nasa sa'yo na yan kung gagawa ka ng paraan para makatakas ka sa kahirapan. walang magulang na gustong makita ang anak nila na nagugutom at walang sapat na matutulugan. walang magulang na gustong makita ang anak nila na may sakit. pero ang kahirapan mo ba ay dapat mong isisi sa magulang mo? i am sure madalas na sinasabi ng mga magulang kung mahirap ka, wag mong ipapasa sa mga magiging anak mo ang kahirapan at para magawa mo ito, una sa lahat, huwag kang mag-aanak ng marami. mag family planning matutong mag birth control. demographically, the more the poorer and large family size causes poverty. ang anak mo ay dapat mapag-graduate mo ng college upang magkaroon ng magandang trabaho. libre naman po ang pag-aaral sa mga government schools. meron tayong mga state universities na halos kakaunti na lang ang babayarang tuition fee. so hindi mo pwedeng i-angal na ""mahirap lang kami"" kaya hindi namin napag aral ang anak namin. makakatulong ang pantawid pamilyang pilipino program (4ps). sa mga magulang na ayaw dumanas na maghirap ang kanilang anak sa paglaki ay yung mga magulang na iginagapang nila ang pag-aaral ng mga anak nila kahit pa sila ay isang labandera, magsasaka, janitor o mangangalakal mapag aral lang nila ang anak nila. maraming mga anak ang nakapag tapos sa kolehiyo sa ganyang pagsisikap ng magulang. huwag ipagkait ang karapatan na ito para sa kinabukasan nila. as i've said it's not someone's fault na ipinanganak silang mahirap. magiging kasalanan lang nila if they stay that way hanggang sa paglaki at ipasa pa ang kahirapan sa mga anak nila and if mali yung landas na tatahakin nila paglaki nila kung magiging tamad at tambay, maging adik, or worse maging kriminal na lang sila, at ang dahilan nila dahil sa kahirapan kaya nila nagawa iyon. magiging kasalanan lang ito ng magulang mo kung naging pabaya sila sa iyo, o tinakasan niya ang responsibilidad niya sa anak niya bilang isang magulang at kung inalisan ka ng karapatan na mag-aral na ang dahilan nila ay dahil sa kahirapan. the right to education is a basic human right and means every *child* should be able to go to school. sa totoo lang, dapat nga mas maging determinado ang mga mahihirap to live a better life. eh ang kaso in real life karamihan sa kanila mas nagiging baliktad ang pananaw nila sa buhay. all they want is to be fed not to learn how to feed themselves, kaya nga maraming nanlilimos sa ganyang aspeto, at maging squatter. dumarami ang urban poor sa manila. i've seen a lot of poor people na naka angat sa buhay and some became rich at ang dahilan sa pag asenso at pagyaman nila ay dahil mas naging determinado silang maabot ang tagumpay dahil sa pagsisikap nila sa sarili at anak nila kahit walang mga natapos yun iba pero umasenso pa rin. dapat ganon ang maging mindset natin, at huwag isisi sa kahirapan lahat dahil wala ka namang mararating at mananatili kang mahirap kung hindi mo ito sosolusyunan. me kasabihan nga tayo,“if you are born poor it's not your mistake, but if you die poor then its your mistake.”",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/17vn8nh/kasalan_mo_ba_na_isinilang_at_lumaki_kang_mahirap/,15 11 2023

Truth why children struggles for reading comprehension in my POV,"i have worked part time as an assistant for my late mother when she was a teacher until she became a principal so i think i'm qualified to post this at least. so bakit nga nagiistruggle ung mga bata especially reading comprehension, what's happening within the school system and this is what i observed for 8 years i have worked in deped. 1. teachers are being worked for community services like feeding programs. imo dapat lgu services ang gumagawa nito not teachers. isa ito sa mga matrabahong ginagawa nila kaya nababawasan ang attention sa bata. pinakahassle dito ung liquidation which really drains the life out of you. 2. teachers are being worked for data reports instead of adding an employee for the task. isa ito sa mga pinakaiinisan ng mga teachers. not just time consuming, nakakalito pa sa dami ng data kailangang ipasa sa deped within a short period of time. the higher-ups mentality: kung ayaw mo humanap ka ng ibang trabaho (what a nice way to motivate teachers amiright?!). this job causes teachers para tamarin ng magturo, imbes na lesson plan ang inaatupag nasa data reports na, kaya paggawa ang grades ng bata dinaig pa na galing sa rekto para hindi na sakit sa ulo. also teachers have a hard time adjusting to technology especially yung mga nagstart pang nagturo since 90's era na nasanay na sa papel kaya madaming pinaparework na reports which again causes them to advert their attention from the students. 3. ito masakit: deped really doesnt give a fuck about children performances. totoo naman eh, they only care about the data they demand from the schools wether it is invented or not basta napirmahan at naaprubahan bahala na yung bata kung marunong o hindi. ang bottom line ng mga teachers kung bakit imbento na yung grading especially sa reading comprehension dahil sa reasons 1 & 2 (dagdag mo pa yung mga bata na ayaw matuto). also matrabaho ang magparemedial reading at apektado din grades mo as a teacher dahil mababa ung grado ng reading comprehension ng bata habang naghahabol ka ng data reports ng deped(o diba ang dami). so anong solusyon? ipasa mo nalang kahit hindi marunong. wala man lang akong nakitang employee na nagveverify ng reading comprehension ng mga students. basta ang kalakaran as long as papers goes it goes. 4. corruption in deped and broken promises. my mother (school principal) and her teachers are always promised laptops since 2017 pero walang dumadating. during their seminars laging pinagmamalaki ng regional supervisor for this annual budget at magkakaroon sila ng makabagong gamit. welp never happened, outdated parin laptops ng mga teachers, i think 2015 pa ata ung models na ginagamit ng mga teachers dito ofc im not going to disclose the location. this mostly started during duterte's term pero nung kay pnoy madami laging bagong learning materials at libro hindi pa masyado uso laptops noon. demanding ang deped pero hindi progressive yan ang katotohan sadly. out of touch ang higher-ups sa mga front liners kaya tayo umabot sa ganito. teachers works are overloaded and demanding yet underpaid. so kung may opinions pa kayo just comment down below.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/wsv9x2/truth_why_children_struggles_for_reading/,20 08 2022

Pansin ko lang ha?,"pansin ko lang, 2 months after election yung mga kakampink medyo hindi na nag-iingay sa social media. balik sa mga dating gawain; nagtatrabaho, nagwowork-out, kumakain sa labas, nagtatravel at tinatrabaho ang mga goals sa buhay. meron silang maliit na safe space at people upang pagusapan ang nangyayare sa bansa. yung iba tumigil nang makipagbardagulan. pero yung mga apollo10, patuloy sa pagpuna kay leni at iba pang kaanib. ang dami nilang oras maghanap ng sakit ng katawan. hindi ba sila napapagod? na sa araw araw na ginawa ng diyos patuloy silang napopoot sa ibang tao. hindi ba nila alam na ang katahimikan ng buhay ay isa sa pinakamasarap na pakiramdam? siguro tama nga ang narealize ko this past few days. kapag madami tayong oras pagusapan ang buhay ng ibang tao mas nagiging insufficient tayo sa mga bagau na dapat nateng gawin. hindi tayo productive. hindi tayo umuunlad.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/w1aa4f/pansin_ko_lang_ha/,17 07 2022

Manila Memorial Park Cemetery especially Sucat & Dasmariñas are ANIMAL MURDERERS!,"guys pa-vent lang ako, first time ko maglalabas ng sama ng loob dito sa reddit. hindi ko na talaga kinakaya mga nangyayari regarding animal welfare dito sa pilipinas. way back 2019, na videohan ng isang netizen ang pagbaril ng mga sekyu ng mmp dasmariñas sa mga stray dogs. tapos ito recently, sa sucat, pinaglalason naman lahat ng stray dogs and cats na inaalagaan at pinapakain ng mga advocates and volunteers sa tulong ng mga donations. nagsagawa pa sila ng tnvr (trap-neuter-vaccinate-return) bago mangyari yung paglason sa mga strays. tapos ganun lang ginawa ng management ng mmp. sobrang nakakadurog ng puso, alam ko karamihan ng mga animal welfare advocates nakakaramdam na rin ng pagod kasi kahit mismong government natin wala man lang concern. pero sana man lang, ‘wag naman po tayo manakit ng mga walang kalaban laban. sabi nga diba, “make a habit of two things - to help, or at least, to do no harm”. ang sakit lang po talaga bilang may rescued dog din po ako and stray feeder, and masasabi ko na sobra sobra yung pagpaparamdam nila ng love sa maliliit na bagay na nabibigay at natutulong natin sa kanila. please check these screenshots po to know the whole story. thank you po sa pagbabasa.",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/17d9453,21 10 2023

Short Tagalog Story (I hope you like it),"i'm in a creative mood so i thought of writing a short story. mga anito ng maynila **sa may simbahan ng binondo** nakatingin ang babae sa kalesa at sa kabayo na nakapwesto sa harap ng simbahan ng binondo. may maliit na ngiti sa gilid ng kanyang labi. “sakay kayo?” tanong ng kutsero sa babae. “di ko akalaing makakita ako ng ganito dito.” sabi ng babae. “konti na nga lang mga kalesa dito sa maynila. kung gusto nyo ng ikot lang pwede na ang tatlong daan, pa gabi na din kasi.” “salamat, pero di ko po sila kayang sakyan.” “dalawang daan?” “salamat pa rin po.” tumango ang kutsero at bumalik sa panonood sa kanyang cellphone. “hanapin mo ako.” bulong ng babae sa kabayo bago maglakad pa alis. **sa isang murang hotel sa soler st.** nag ring ang telepono sa room 314. “mam, may lalaki po dito hinahanap kayo.” “paki patuluyin mo sa kwarto ko.” “bukas yan” ang sagot ng babae pagka katok sa kanyang pinto. “nakita mo ang ilaw ng kandila?” tumango ang mama. “pwede ba?” tanong ng lalaki nung binunot nya ang pakete ng fortune. humindi ang babae at tinuro ang “no-smoking” sign sa kwarto. “nagulat ako nung nakita kita kanina, di ko inakalang may… kagaya mo dito sa siyudad.” “at di ko din inakalang may manananggal na bibisita sa siyudad at tumabi pa sa simbahan.” “walang epekto ang simbahan sa akin, taga panga-alaga pa nga ako ng mga santo sa amin. kung alam lang ng mga tao dun.” tumingin tingin ang lalaki sa kwarto. may kandilang itim na naka sindi sa maliit na lamesa at may maleta na may sticker ng cebu pacific na galing tagbilaran sa sahig. “galing ka ng bohol?” “sa loon. nakita ko ang pangalan mo sa kalesa. richard nga ba ang pangalan mo?” tumango ang lalaki. “ako si avelina pero lina na lang itawag mo sa akin” “ano ang pakay mo dito?” “hinahanap ko si bathala.” “di na sya ang bathalang tulad ng dati.” “nandito nga sya? kaya mo ba akong samahan papunta sa kanya?” nagisip isip si richard at walang maisagot sa babae. “may sakit ako at konti na lang ang oras ko dito, sya na lang ang pag asa ko.” “sasamahan kita sa kanya, pero wag ka magugulat sa makikita mo.” bumaba papuntang lobby ang dalawa at lumabas ng hotel. kahit lagpas alas-onse ng gabi ay madami pa din mga kotse sa kalsada. “malayo ba sya?” “walang deretsong jeep papunta sa pwesto nya, lakarin na lang natin.” sarado na ang mga tindahan bukod sa mga 7-11 na nadaraanan ng dalawa. nakapag sindi na din ng sigarilyo si richard habang nag lalakad. “matagal ka na dito sa maynila?” “mga tatlumpung taon na.” “alam ng kutsero kung ano ka?” “oo, mabait ang pamilyang yun sa akin. yung kutsero kanina, anak na yun ng may ari ng kalesa.” “meron din kagaya mo sa bohol, pero sa ibang lugar sila nakatira. may kilala akong apat na kagaya mo doon.” “ikaw pa lang ang manananggal na nakita ko dito sa loob ng apat na taon. may nakilala ako dati na nagging flight stewardess. mahilig yata kayo talagang lumipad.” “di ko yata kaya ang mawalay sa mga tanim at alaga ko. parang ikaw, mukha naman kuntento ka na sa pamilyang kumupkop sayo.” “araguy!” napatigil ang matandang babae dahil sa sakit sa tagiliran. inalalayan naman sya ni richard. “mabilis sana kung lumipad tayo, pero di ko alam saan ang pupuntahan natin.” “di mo ako kayang bitbitin, manang” “akala mo lang, tikbalang” “malapit na din tayo, ulitin ko lang, wag ka magulat sa makikita mo.” tumango si avelina sa sinabi ni richard. nakarating sila sa quiapo church at naglakad patungo sa mga eskinita sa tabi nito. may tindahan ng mga halamang gamot at iba rito ay nasa botelya. “pampa-regla” “gamot sa eksema” mga nakadikit sa bote. may matandang lalaking panot at mabahong natutulog sa tabi ng tindahan na ito. “sya ang hinahanap mo” sabi ni richard kay manang. lumuhod si manang kay bathala at binaba ang ulo. umubo si richard para magising si bathala. walang nangyari at patuloy lang sa pag hilik ang matandang lalaki. tinapik na ni richard ang upuan ng lalaki kaya ito nagising. nagulat si bathala ng makitang si manang avelina na nakaluhod sa harapan nya sabay tingin kay richard. “hoy kamusta, richard? buhat na dyan, di mo kailangan gawin yan, basta may pambayad ka may gamot ako dito. hula ko hindi pampa regla ang kailangan mo.” “bumyahe pa yan mula bohol para makita ka.” sabi ni richard. “meron po akong sakit at kailangan ko ang tulong nyo.” “ano ang sakit mo?” at kinuwento nga ni manang avelina ang kanyang mga sintomas at nakinig naman si bathala. “pasensya ka na, pero wala akong maitutulong sa sakit mo. mga gamot na mabibigay ko ay pantulong lang sa kirot pero di ito mapapahaba ang buhay mo.” “naniniwala pa po ako sa inyong kapangyarihan. baka pwede nyo pong gamitin ang kapangyarihan nyo sa akin.” natawa si bathala. “nakikita mo ba ako? tatlong araw na akong di nakakaligo at nagbabantay na lang ako ng tindahan na ito. dito ako natutulog dahil wala akong bahay. alam mo kung bakit ko piniling pumwesto dito sa simbahan ng quiapo? para maramdaman ko man lang na ako ang sinasamba ng mga tao pero hindi ako ang sinasamba nila kaya’t wala na akong kapangyarihan. ang mangilan-ngilan na kapangyarihan ko sa mga mangigilan na bumubulong ng pangalan ko sa kanilang dasal ay binubuhos ko sa mga gamot na to.” “alam mo sinasamba ng mga tao ngayon? pera. wala din ako nyan. mukha bang malakas ang bentahan ng pwesto ko? pero bebentahan kita ng gamot dahil di pa din ako kumakain ng pang gabi. itong isang bote na to, 350 na lang. inumin mo to isang kutsara sa umaga at isa sa gabi para sa sakit. pero ulitin ko, di ka nito mapapagaling.” kumuha ng pera si manang avelina sa kanyang pitaka at ibinayad kay bathala. “salamat! bumalik ka, hija! at kung maari, babalik na ako sa tulog ko. richard, daan ka ulit dito minsan. kwentuhan tayo.” “salamat pa rin po, dakilang bathala.” at naglakad na pabalik patungo sa hotel ang dalawa. “ayoko man isipin at ayokong maniwala, pero pera na nga yata ang kapangyarihan ngayon. yun na din yata ang sagot sa sakit ko.” sabi ni lina habang naglalakad pabalik. “at least kung may pera ako may pang ospital ako.” “kung di ka din matutulungan ni bathala at pera din lang pala sagot sa problema mo baka hindi si bathala ang pinuntahan natin.” “sino?” “si pilandok” hope to be continued",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/vy5jhx/short_tagalog_story_i_hope_you_like_it/,13 07 2022

Permanent WFH Setup: Filipinos Should Look Into Virtual Assistant (VA) Industry,"i want to share this here hoping that it could help some people who are tired from the daily commute that they have to endure just to get to work. marami pa ibang dahilan bakit gusto mag wfh ng isang tao katulad ng: * kailangan mag alaga ng anak o kapamilya na may sakit o matanda na, * malayo ang bahay sa trabaho kaya gusto makatipid sa pamasahe/gas, * estudyante na gusto ng pang allowance/tuition, * may sakit pero kailangan pa rin magtrabaho para may kita, * etc. virtual assistant (va) is a general term that refers to freelancers working **remotely** for **foreign clients**. merong mga freelancers na hindi remote workers (e.g. photographer, model, insurance agent, etc.) kaya wag ka malilito sa term na ""freelancer"" at ""va"". vas yung mga nagtatrabaho sa bahay, sa coffee shop, sa beach, kahit saan kase ""remote worker"" sila. never nila poproblemahin ang return-to-office (rto) order kase nasa ibang bansa yung client nila. anong pwede maging trabaho ng va? depende sa designation. a va can be a/an: * administrative assistant, * architect, * auditor, * bookkeeper, * content creator, * customer service representative, * graphic designer, * human resource, * it personnel * paralegal, * seo specialist, * social media manager, * web developer, * writer, * etc. halos lahat ng designation pwede ma-categorize as va basta permanent wfh + foreign client. just like traditional jobs, you need to apply for the position, undergo interview, training and you can be laid off too due to poor performance, bankruptcy, world crisis, etc. > pros ng pagiging va 1. permanent wfh setup 2. flexible hours (depending on the contract) 3. salary in foreign currency 4. lower tax rate 5. work-life balance > cons ng pagiging va 1. you need to be tech savvy to start in this field, 2. saturated market. madami gusto mag wfh ever since nag pandemic, 3. no ph government benefits, ikaw magfa-file ng taxes mo at magbabayad ng contributions mo as self-employed, 4. no hmo, 13th month pay and bonus **unless** mag agree kayo ng client na meron 5. you need to be independent and resourceful kase kung gusto mo tinuturo lahat sayo at wala ka initiative matuto mag isa, mahirap. short story: i became a part-time va (social media manager) in 2016. i worked with an australian client but i left after 6 months kase mababa ang sahod tapos lakas mag micro-manage and nag focus na lang ako sa pag aaral. tumigil ako ng ilang taon, kinalimutan ko na, maliit naman sahod. in 2019, few months before covid lockdown, i tried again because school expenses are hurting my pocket. this time, i am a full-time va (administrative assistant) for a us client. my starting salary was php22,500 and then it went up to 25k to 27k to 50k. i was promoted to operations manager and started earning php100k a month. after graduation and during bar review, i continued working. when i passed the bar exam in 2022, i told my client that i will leave the job so i can focus on my legal career. he does not want me to leave so he doubled my salary from 2k usd to 4k usd (php200k a month). he also pays for our medical insurance, 13th and 14th month pay, monthly bonus and gadget upgrade. currently, i have 2 jobs: va and my traditional job. mahirap ang buhay. kung kaya mag double job, grab it. you can learn to be a va through: 1. reddit (r/buhaydigital) 2. facebook (online filipino freelancers page) 3. youtube 4. other vas 5. google hindi kami hiring ngayon, wag nyo i-send saken resume nyo. protect your identity, this is reddit. i am just hoping that this could help someone who wants a permanent wfh setup. sobrang pahirap yung public transportation system sa pilipinas, and it will take years and good leaders before we see improvements. that's it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/w8j318/permanent_wfh_setup_filipinos_should_look_into/,26 07 2022

It's so uncomfortable to be a woman in this country,"as a teenager college student dito sa maynila, sobrang uncomfortable maging babae. kaliwa't kanan yung pambabastos na mae-encounter mo kahit saan ka mapadpad and worse is, yung mga nangbabastos, mindset nila na walang mali sa ugali nila. like one time before, nagdo-dorm ako nearby my university at medyo late na ako nakauwi dahil nag-apply ako ng trabaho kaya halos lahat ng karinderya, sarado na except doon sa nabilhan ko. halos lahat ng staff lalaki, wala namang problema pero ang uncomfortable kasi nagsisikuan sila at pinagbubulungan ako. may isa pa na nagsabi, ""sagot na raw ni ano order mo."" di ko pinansin kasi pag tinawanan ko o ano, iisipin nilang okay lang. then nung kukunin ko na order ko, ayaw pang iabot sakin saka bumulong nang, ""ano raw pangalan mo te."" saka bahagyang lumapit sakin kaya umatras ako saka tinignan sila nang masama. saka lumabas na rin ako agad. isa pa nung sasakay ako sa jeep, rush hour at bihira yung ruta papunta sa amin nung may napansin ako na bakante ng isa sa unahan. kaya tinanong ko yung driver kung pwede ba sa unahan (since most ay asawa nila pinapaupo nila doon at di nagpapasakay ng iba) then he answered me, ""dito sa tabi ko?"" saka sya bahagyang umusod na akala mo eh uupo mga ako doon. putangina. di ko na lang pinansin saka lumakad na lang ako sa kabilang side. may kausap sya na isang lalaki na sinasabing loko-loko raw sya saka naman sumagot yung driver nang,"" binata ako!"" like wtf eh ano? pass mo ba yon para mangbastos? seriously, i just really wish na mag-improve ang mindset ng mga tao sa pinas. nakakagago kasi na yung pambabastos eh masyadong normalized tapos ni hindi nila iniisip na may mali sa mindset nila. mga punyeta.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/166a5jm/its_so_uncomfortable_to_be_a_woman_in_this_country/,31 08 2023

Woes of a Kakampink OFW,"last year i had a falling out with my family. very vocal kasi ako na kakampink ako. i was the only kakampink in the family, aside from my 14-year old niece. but she can't vote, so her posts about leni were always the butt of the joke in the family group chat. 'ang bata bata mo pa, akala mo naman may alam ka!', they would say. i would post leni's advocacies and they would put 'haha' reacts to it. hinayaan ko lang. election came and went, bbm won, sara won, but i never shut up. post pa rin ako nang post sa facebook calling out how they blatantly steal from the filipino people. they would comment, pero hindi na ako pumapatol, 'haha' react na lang pabalik tutal ganoon lang din naman ang ginagawa nila kapag wala na silang masabi to defend bbm. pero hindi na ako nakapagtimpi when they told me to shut up because i was not living in the philippines. hindi na ako nakatira sa pilipinas, pero ramdam na ramdam ko pa rin ang hirap dahil nagpapadala ako sa kanila. it's as if nawalan ako ng karapatan dahil wala ako doon, pero ako naman ang gumagastos para sa kanila? 'manahimik ka na, wala ka naman dito!', pero pagdating ng bills ng kuryente, wifi at tubig, sa akin hihingi. 'manahimik ka, di mo naman alam mga nagagawa ni bbm dito!', pero kapag wala na silang makain, sa akin tatakbo. 'shut up na, sa ibang bansa ka naman nagttrabaho!', kahit philippines pa rin ang hawak kong passport at pilipino ako. i'm in the process of acquiring a new citizenship in a year. hindi na ako makapaghintay hindi maging pilipino. para manahimik na talaga ako. dumating sa punto na php 200k ang naipadala ko sa isang buwan sa kanila. yung pang grocery at pambayad ng bills, suddenly, kulang na kulang na. pero shut up daw ako kasi wala naman daw ako sa pilipinas. edit: naoverwhelm ako sa dami ng comments. - why would they bite the hands that feed them? gaya nga ng sabi ko, do not underestimate people's audacity. it's the 'anak ka lang namin, wala ka dito sa mundong ibabaw kung hindi dahil sa amin' mentality. - bakit nagpapadala ka pa? my 8-yr old sister isn't independent. malaki ang padala ko kasi may sakit siya and kailangan ng meds. sinubukan ko na yung sa kanya lang padaanin pero ang sagot eh 'di ako marunong magwithdraw', 'di ko alam yan eh'. - you get what you tolerate. takot akong maging mag-isa sa buhay, probably, dahil alam kong kapag cinut-off ko sila, lahat, including extended family, damay. siguro di pa ako handa maging mag-isa kaya takot ako magcut-off. may matitira naman, mga pinsang bukas mag-isip pero ilan ilan lang din. once i get my new citizenship, kukunin ko na yung mga kapatid ko (i have a brother na mas matanda pero ignorante rin; kukunin ko pa rin siya dahil naniniwala naman akong with proper education mamumulat sila sa kung ano ang tama). edit 2: some shit went down earlier kasi sinunod ko yung isang comment dito na ipost to sa facebook. i will update kapag tapos na kami sa confrontation. ilang oras na kami nagchchat and i tried to call them, nirereject at sa chat na lang daw kami mag-usap dahil baka raw di nila ako matancha. hahahahahahaha.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/16p0yni/woes_of_a_kakampink_ofw/,22 09 2023

I drop KDramas when the Philippines is mentioned in a bad light,"don't eat me alive for my opinion. wala lang, parang nawawalan ako ng interes pag imemention nila ang pinas na parang takbuhan ng kriminal ganon (kahit totoo, no?). parang nadidismaya ako. i mean, ang dami ng south koreans na nagpupunta dito to learn english, ang dami din sa kanilang nagstart ng businesses dito, and they make so much money from fans of their celebrities... tapos ang ibabalik sa'tin halos laging negative yung connotation. i think the only half-assed effort i saw their writers do was to mention that the main kontrabida girlies were going off to cebu for a vacay - pero parang hindi sila masyadong excited? yung delivery eh, parang ""it's just a cheap vacation though\~ugh\~""... and cebu is *not* a cheap vacay spot for us naman? like, ang ganda kaya sa cebu? i'm aware naman na hindi lang ph ang namemention nila in a bad light. they also mention other countries like china, sure, pero it kind of puts me off and leaves a sour taste in my mouth when they sprinkle in this detail in their dialogues. of course, favorite theme din naman ng tv shows and movies natin ang social problems and such pero idk basta for me i don't like it when i see it sa kdrama hahaha. aamin ko din, talagang mas maganda naman talaga quality ng stories ng kdramas - i appreciate how they always manage to churn out unique and entertaining shows while following their tried and tested formulas. and i really like the new non-cutesy ones - maybe cos i've graduated from romcoms to thrillers and action shows. wag niyo akong tanungin kung ano yung mga show yung mga drinop ko, nakalimutan ko na titles nila.ang naalala ko lang cloy hahaha! usually fleeting lang naman yung lines na yon pero once kasi na nakita ko, nawawala na talaga interes ko. yun lang po. end rant. :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/180hw6x/i_drop_kdramas_when_the_philippines_is_mentioned/,21 11 2023

Some jeepney drivers don’t deserve their license.,"meron talagang mga jeepney drivers na mae-encounter ka na mapapaisip ka nalang, “paano kaya nakakuha ng lisensya to?”. sunod-sunod na traffic violations, mainit ang ulo na idadamay pa yung mga inosenteng pasahero, di nagbibigay ng sukli, etc. i don’t want this post na maging anti-poor. i know all of them just want to make a living and provide for their families but that doesn’t mean naman na they can just be reckless sa road, right? when you’re driving, especially a public vehicle, hindi lang life mo ang at risk, mga pasahero mo rin. last friday i encountered this extremely rude jeepney driver along alabang-zapote road. just to be clear hindi ako yung sinungitan nya but other pasahero pero i feel really bad for them because isipin mo sobrang init na ng panahon and pagod ka from work or school tapos ganyan pa ugali ng jeepney driver na masasakyan mo. like this one guy said “sa tabi lang po” and i’m guessing he assumed that the driver didn’t hear what he said so the pasahero said “para po” ng 2 times pa ulit. the driver got mad and shouted “sa susunod nga na nagmamadali kayo bumili kayo ng sarili nyong sasakyan ha”. nasa tabi ng driver ako nakaupo nun so rinig na rinig ko talaga and i was shookt. then meron pa na may nakasabay sya sa kabilang lane na friend nyang jeepney driver din and nag kwentuhan sila habang nag d-drive ng sobrang bagal it was causing traffic na sa likod, one driver behind him talagang nag b-beep na sa kanila and this caused him to explode again and shouted “putang ina mo kanina ka pa busina nang busina ha”. tapos one person said “para po” pero this time di talaga narinig ng driver kaya napahinto sya sa may bandang intersection and he got pissed again and shouted about how filipinos are pasaway daw and stuff na bakit ngayon lang daw bababa. gosh, the amount of times i rolled my eyes during the byahe talaga. then the driver stopped suddenly and said sa lahat ng pasahero “wala bang bababa dyan?” then no one responded but i noticed this one student slightly leaning forward to get a clear view of the road ahead, obvious naman na bababa sya malapit na. the driver ignored this and exclaimed “wala na bababa dyan ng alanganin ha” sabay harurot ng sobrang bilis, completely ignoring the poor student saying “para po” and di tumigil hanggang di nakarating sa next stop light. after that thing talaga i realized di ko na kaya tagalan yung driver na yun, bumababa nalang ako nung medyo malapit na sa destination ko. when i looked back pa nga i saw na he parked his jeepney na sa side ng road and got off, habang meron pang pasahero sa loob. he just decided that’s the end of his byahe and wala na magagawa yung ibang pasahero but bumaba nalang kahit malayo pa ang destination nila. buong byahe rin bigla bigla syang sumisingit sa ibang lane, nag overflow, di nag si-signal, etc. i was scared for my life. sorry for the long rant. this really just pissed me off. there’s so many things i wish i’ve done like take a picture of his plate number and file a report to ltfrb pero di ko rin nagawa because i was also slightly bothered by the thought na baka magalit sya sa akin if i even dare take a picture of his jeepney.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/17deymr/some_jeepney_drivers_dont_deserve_their_license/,21 10 2023

Japanese discrimination of Filipinos in Japan,"nabasa ko yung [isang thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/philippines/comments/17r6v13/this_is_gonna_stir_a_lot_of_people_but_koreans/) tungkol sa mga koreano nung isang araw, kaya naisip kong gumawa naman nitong isa tungkol sa japan. kaunting background tungkol sa akin, meron akong jlpt n1, 20+ years sa japan, hindi ko na lang sasabihin ang trabaho ko para naman may kaunting anonymity. iba't-ibang pinoy sa japan may iba't-ibang experience for sure, so ito ay aking experience lang. feel free to share yours. sabi nung isang hapon sa kabilang thread (hapon daw siya pero you can be whatever you want on the internet), the japanese look down on filipinos. this is natural, i'm not saying it's right, it's just what you'd expect. titignan ng mga hapon ang gulo ng pilipinas, they'll compare and they'll think that filipinos have an inferior culture. ito ang aking observation sa paninirahan sa japan: * 5% of the japanese (i just plucked that % out of thin air) probably don't look down on me when they first meet me and learn that i'm filipino. * 85% will probably have a preconceived notion that being filipino, i'm somewhat inferior to them. in my experience, if they see that you make an effort to learn their culture (being good in japanese, etc), having a good job (i outrank many japanese at work), being a good member of the community (i help keep our little neighborhood clean), and being generally a well-behaved member of society, most of their prejudice go away. they'll treat you as equal (maybe not a member of their inner circle (you're a gaijin), but certainly not inferior). maaring ayaw pa rin nilang maniwala na equal kami, pero hindi puwedeng hindi dahil mas magaling ang mga anak ko sa school kesa sa mga anak nila, haha. * 10% are probably just plain racists. they were born that way and you can't change them no matter what you do. fortunately, sabi ng iba doon sa kabilang thread, japanese are polite racists. maybe 5% of these won't show it, and the other 5% will let you know to your face. so far halos wala akong experience na ganito. either magaling silang magtago o iba lang talaga ang lugar ko dito. so if you're thinking of coming to japan, palagay ko maganda ditong tumira long-term. sa aking experience ay mas malaki ang ginagawang discrimination ng mga mayayaman sa pilipinas sa mga mahihirap kesa mga hapon sa mga pilipino sa japan.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/17s1qaw/japanese_discrimination_of_filipinos_in_japan/,10 11 2023
Indirect Prostitution,"di ko alam kung ito ang tamang flair sorry na agad. so kanina maroon kaming online party ng mga kawork, then nagsalita yung isa kong ka workmate na french. tanong nya ""i may sound round byt is pimping part of filipino culture?"" 2 lang kaming pinoy sa team namin so nagulat kami kaya tinanong namin sya kung bakit. sabi nya yung friend nya pinakilala sa kanya yung filipino gf tapos yung gf may mga filipino friends na kasama. take note sa france lahat ito naganap okay. so nung una medyo okay kwentuhan inuman sila then alam nyo naman tayong mga pinoy marami sa atin feeling close/bida-bida yung isang friend ng filipino gf nya na lalaki tinanong si french kung nakapunta na syang pinas. reply ni french di pa pero gusto nya pumunta to travel. bumanat na yung pinoy dapat subukan nyang pumunta kasi madaming magandang lugar sa pinas at maraming magandang babae. ang dating kay french, binubugaw ng kausap nya yung mga filipina kumbaga undertone nyang sinasabi na mag sexpat si french. sabi namin ng kaworkmate kong pinoy bka nagbibiro lang yun saka di lahat ganun pero sabi ni french usually daw ng mga namemeet nyang mga pinoy ganun sinasabi. bigla kong naisip pag ibang lahi nag propromote ng bansa nila for example thai, kahit talamak sexpat dun, di nial yun binabangit na thai women are beautiful; sinasabi nila bangkok is beautiful, masarap pagkain, punta sa ganiri may malaking buddha etc japanese ganun din magrerecommend ng mga lugar or activities halos lahat ng nakilala ko online pag tinatanong ko yung lugar nila tourist destination or activites. pero karamihan, di naman lahat, ng mga pinoy overseas na nakakausap ng foreigner madalas banggitin na ""filipino women are beautiful"" which is like indirect pimping nga. kasi ano point na sabihin mo yun? pag sinabi mo na cebu is beautiful, you are promoting cebu to the foreigner para puntahan nila yung lugar; ngayon pag sinabi mo na filipinas are beautfiul you should go to philippines parang pinapahiwatig mo na reason iyon na pumunta si foreigner sa pinas; ano gagawin nya sa filipina? ano mo namang titigan lang. mas okay pa sabihin filipino people are nice and friendly etc &#x200b;",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/189iklm/indirect_prostitution/,3 12 2023

Matanda sa Bus (Ghost Story),"pauwi ako ng baguio for the barangay elections. the trip via bus from manila was fine. nothing special since sanay naman na akong pabalik-balik from manila to baguio. but this one time, october 28, 2023, to be specific, has become one of the most unforgettable biyahe moments ko. it was around 2:00 am na and paakyat na ng baguio yung bus (a couple hours na lang baguio na), i was asleep pero nagising ako kasi nakaramdam ako ng parang bump which is normal naman. and then i felt na kailangan ko i-adjust yung pants ko kasi kasi medyo hindi na comfy so i had to stand up to do it. tapos for a quick reference l was sitting at the middle part of the bus. habang inaayos ko yung pants ko i saw an old woman boarded the bus. hindi pa ako nagsususpetsa that time coz i wasn't expecting such incident to happen so the first na pumasok sa isip ko bakit hindi inaalalayan ni kuyang kundoktor si lola? and also, bakit naka-dim pa rin yung mga ilaw? ang hindi pumasok sa isip ko, paano siya nakasakay e umaandar? eh itong part ng biyahe na ito is yung part kung saan mabilis yung patakbo ng bus. so nung umupo na ako, i was still looking at the old woman na naglalakad nang mabagal. this time i was aware na something was off. something was paranormal. i was staring at her (the old woman) that time nang kalabitin ako nung ""auntie"" sitting next to me. she said but in ilocano, something like ""wag mong titigan nang titigan kasi baka sumunod sayo."" those words sent shiver to my spine as the old woman gets closer to our spot. sobrang pigil na pigil hininga ko nung dumaan siya sa tabi ko. tapos as she gets closer sobrang clear ng details ng damit niya. she was wearing a navy blue dress na parang sobrang luma (sorry not good with history), pero basically tao siya nung unang panahon. she was also wearing a feathered hairpin idk something like that. may tungkod rin siya na naririnig ko every time ahe steps. pero hindi ko maaninag yung mukha niya. also nung dumaan siya sobrang pungent nung amoy parang masusuka ka sa amoy. nakahinga lang ako (or kami) nung lumagpas na siya sa amin. parang ayaw kong gumalaw that time, and then after siguro mga 30-40 minutes narinig nanaman namin yung tungkod niya and it's approaching. sabi nung ""auntie"" beside me, wag ko daw papansinin kasi sumasama daw yung mga ganun. again the smell nung malapit na siya. tapos what made me cry a little sa sobrang takot is nung nakita ko yung likuran niya, may nakatusok na kahoy idk, tapos some kind of tar was streaming out galing dun sa pinagtusukan. tapos parang walang nangyare nung nakababa na siya. pero when i got in front of our gate halos gibain ko na yung pundasyon sa sobrang takot huhuhu next time na bbiyahe ako pauwi may kasama na ako!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/17j55v2/matanda_sa_bus_ghost_story/,29 10 2023

"Opinion: In some cases and ways, mas homophobic pa pinays kesa sa male pinoys.","first of all, i was inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/philippines/comments/107679q/why_does_no_one_address_maletomale_sexual/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) sa post nito, andame nagsasabe sa comments na ang homophobic raw ng straight guys. i argue otherwise; in my experience, honestly lang, alam ko ang weird and napaka-counter-intuitive pero mas madame akong kilalang homophobes na straight females kesa sa straight males. crazy, right???!! sobrang dameng beses ko na na-encounter yung mga babaeng nagsasabe na ""omg ang gwapo naman. sayang bakla pala."" and ""ano ba yan andame nang mga bakla. konti nalang mga ""tunay na lalake"" sa panahon ngayon. need i remind you, hindi porket good-looking or attractive yung isang tao, hindi sila obliged or/and hindi entitled mga babae na maging straight yung mga taong yun. subtly napansin ko lanv all over the years kasi ever since elementary ko pa to naririnig, ngayon ko lang na-realize na napaka-homophobic pala ng statements na yan - again - these come from girls. not men. another example is nao-overhear ko lang sa arguments between girls and gays are that pagnatatalo sa usapan yung straight girls, final card nila is ""bakit? tunay na babae ka ba?"" and similar lines. again, wala ako pake. hindi ko kasalanan nao-overhear ko arguments nila sa classroom or in public pero ngayon ko lang din na-realize, parang sobrang taas ng tingin ng mga females just because of their gender and thus homophobic. andame ko din neighbors and friends of relatives na napaka-straight up ang baba ng tingin and diring diri sa mga gay people. one female friend of a relative of mine once said derogatory remarks sa gay tito namin nung may party a few years ago. isa ko pang babaeng classmate na religious noong senior high school sabe (hindi ko matandaan exact words) ""lalake ka talaga, sis. pagna-realize mo sa bible and pag narinig mo calling ni god, malalaman mo na hindi totoo mga bakla."" or something ganun. also, this female classmate rin nagsabe ng ""ay hindi ka marunong magbasketball? hindi ka naman barbie (bakla)?"" like holy shit. (and am very aware that other female pinays think like this, given our upbringing as filipinos). so it may seem like straight females pa ang mas sympathetic sa lgbt community at first glance, it isn't always the case. lahat ng straight guys na kakilala ko either walang pake sa mga gay guys and may isa pa nga ako kakilala na he's a straight guy pero halos.. (tinatantsa ko lang btw) halos 70% ng friends nya ay gay guys or straight girls. although, had to admit, nung high school and elem gays, mas critical ang boys sa lgbt community. pero after high school - pag dating sa shs, college or pag way past 18 na, i realized parang **on the inside** mas homophobic filipino women kesa sa filipino men. ayun lang po, have a good day. edit: another one: last year, may argument sa facebook and one girl said, ""mukha ba kong papatol dyan? tingin nyo magpapa-k*ntot ako dyan? mukha ngang paminta yan."" edit: i can give more examples if y'all want. and plus, handa ako madownote to oblivion and ma-ban ako from r/ph just for speaking the truth based on my experience. it's one of my principles to speak truthfully kahit na hindi angkop sa society na i'm living in.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/107dr7u/opinion_in_some_cases_and_ways_mas_homophobic_pa/,9 01 2023

Managed to leave the country and thought: what in the actual h*ll is wrong with the Philippines,"hello r/philippines! i have left the philippines. this is a post about my disillusionment in the past while living there. brief context: i made a few posts in the past here in the past about a lot of bad stuff that was happening in my life (e.g. my narc pinoy parents filing a false kidnapping report in case i leave the house, and my doubts on if a psychiatrist will actually help me or not if i go to them about my issues) but things have taken a good turn and i have finally managed to leave the country by marrying my dual citizen s/o living abroad (not going to say which country for anonymity reasons). living abroad, i experienced a lot of things that i thought was impossible. here's a few: * i'm earning 100k php a month for an entry-level job. they didn't even ask me to have a bachelor's degree, a pleasing personality and 50 valid ids. * public offices take 20-40 minutes to process documents. i got a resident id on the same day. * the mental health industry actually wants to help me with my mental health conditions (the psychiatrist told me to try consulting with a psychologist first because he warned me that the medications may have unwanted irreversible effects). * my workmates are actually supportive and seek to see me succeed! they said i'm their most promising workmate and they want me to be their manager in the future. * i'm more comfortable opening up to people, they judge me less and they're more inquisitive/open-minded about the things i've went through and my life decisions. * they don't force me into any social interactions. i'm not forced to participate in any social gatherings if i don't wish to. * people are generally more respectful of my boundaries. * i'm not compared to anyone else. * i'm not shamed for my hobbies. * the system doesn't work against me. now, the typical response is to absorb all of this and say ""i'll forget about the shit i went through, i'm finally here where i want to be and am appreciated,"" right? to be honest, i'm disillusioned. why? well, first, i gave my parents a second chance and then stopped going no-contact with them after i finally went abroad. i told them how i was doing and the response i got was: ""edi waw."" ""sana all."" ""sana andiyan ka para saamin."" ""bigyan mo na kami para patawarin namin mga taon na hindi ka nagusap saamin."" ""inisip mo ba yung mga kapatid mo sa ginagawa mo?"" they weren't happy for my achievements. i thought they would finally put behind all those years of abuse i went through from their narcissism, but no, they're bitter that i stopped talking to them because they won't let me move out on their terms. i did what i couldn't before: i gave them my genuine feelings about their response, and told them to not expect any more contact from me in the future. they went, ""sige ka maawa ka saamin."" then i realized, what if i hit them where it hurts? i told them that i will not be sending them any money either anytime in the future. that's when they went ballistic. ""wala kng kwentang anak"" ""ganyan ka sa lahat ginawa namin para sayo?"" ""sinakripisyo kami lahat para sayo"" i told them i don't care. they threatened legal action against me, my s/o, and my s/o's family. i told them ""lol"" then blocked them after. that's something that i never would've done if not for me deciding to take the leap to leave the country. i don't regret my interactions with my parents, but i'm disillusioned with the years i spent in the philippines. i felt like all the years i spent there could've been prevented and avoided by simply not living there. i actually regret being born in into a toxic family within the philippines. then i remembered the things i went through: * i tried to apply for a job that paid 15k per month, but they chose this beauty pageant winner (who allegedly has no job, internship or volunteer experience) even though they said that i have a very promising, experienced resume (i have three internships and a lot of volunteer experience) and that i'm practically good for the job. * to this day i still don't have my national id lmao. i got a fixer for a driver's license, got the bs ""temporary driver's license"" which was literally printed on a piece of a4 paper, and used that for my passport. i don't even know how to drive lmao, i just did that for passport requirements (don't worry, i'm taking driving school in the country i'm currently in!) * i went to a psychiatrist in the philippines, told them all the shit they went through, and said ""we don't believe you, we'll send a social worker to your house to confirm the situation"" even though i already moved out and had evidence of my parents filing false kidnapping charges. plus they gave me a number to call for a comprehensive mental health examination, but the person answering the number was ""disoriented"" or something (probably on drugs? i'm not sure), said they'd call back, but never called back lol. * all my ""friends"" were jealous of my resume right after we graduated, then constantly tried to one-up me by pushing the fact that they got employed sooner than me into my face. jokes on them; i'm working 40 hours a week and getting 100k a month while they have a lot of unpaid overtime and night shift differentials while they slave away in call centers. * whenever i opened up to people about my life story, people typically say ""pero pamilya mo parin sila"", ""hindi ka ba naawa sa mga kapatid mo?"", ""kahit ganyan ginagawa nila sayo, kausapin mo rin sila"". thanks for the unsolicited advice, but i genuinely do not feel safe with parents who tried to file a false kidnapping case on me. * palagi akong pinilit magsama sa mga party, outing, etc. may beses na hindi ako nagsama, pero tinawagan akong ""suplado"", ""masungit"", ""mataray"", ""mayabang"", ""matapobre"" (wtf), etc. * may isang beses na nagsumbong yung ex-friend ko sa magulang ko kung asan ako nakatira. ex-friend said this was an attempt for my parents to ""fix their relationship with me"". i had to stay in my s/o's house in the province, and i had to revoke my contract with my landlord at the time. i still feel bad for my landlord, but i found him a new tenant myself to make up for it. * palagi akong kinompara sa mga pinsan ko. kinompara din ako sa mga batchmate ko. they said ""buti nalang si person x ganyan, may kwenta sila. gayahin mo yan, wag kang maging walang kwenta."" * i was shamed for doing art commissions to earn money, especially my parents. they said ""kapag yan ginagawa mo, gugutom ka. dapat nagnursing, engineering, accounting, o law ka nalang"". i was also shamed for my other hobbies like photography, traveling, anime, learning japanese, theater (this one hurt; i applied to join the philippine educational theater association, but my parents sabotaged my application by stopping it from reaching the interviewers), etc. * the whole time i lived in the philippines... i felt like the system was against me. it tried to make me into someone i wasn't. it was forcing me to become someone who sacrificed everything for others, while not being given anything in return, and to base my worth as a person on my profession, my income, and how much ""support"" i'm giving to my family. thus comes the thought, what in the actual h\*ll is wrong with the philippines? if anyone is going through something similar to me, i hope my story can help you be confident about being yourself. it's not that you're wrong for being different, you're simply in the wrong place that doesn't accept you. you don't have to leave the country. find others going through the same thing you are, and distance yourself from the people that drag you down.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/16tzqab/managed_to_leave_the_country_and_thought_what_in/,27 09 2023

harassed sa jeep,"for context, i was wearing a short that didn't show any cleavage but just a bit of my thighs, my shirt is just a regular t-shirt, no croptops or stuff.

My thanksgiving dinner experience with a BBM family.,"so eto nga guys, nag-punta kami (me (f), my wife (f) my sister and her bf) reluctantly sa invitation ng ilocano-bbm tita na kapit-bahay namin. may pinag-samahan naman yung family kahit papano, before elections super ganda ng communication namin sa kanila kasi kapitbahay namin dito sa canada. saktong usapan lang, nag-dasal kami bago kumain. to be honest, ang ganda nung prayer. as an agnostic, na-appreciate ko naman siya. pero gagi, yung kapatid ko brining-up yung pag-unfriend ko sa tito ko na misogynistic bbm supporter din tapos sabi sakin bigla nung bbm na tita: ""kayo kasi maka-leni kayong lahat diba? dapat di na kayo nagpapa-niwala sa kwento kwento lang. dapat sa totoong news sources lang."" mind you, binigyan ko lang siya nuon ng heads-up na fake yung website source niya (halatang fake kasi no actual sources from credible organizations, news sites, people, also the ones she sent me usually walang https:// (unsecure-doesnt mean all with https:// are legit as well) tapos yung design nung buong site, parang cult na may agila, illuminati sht - web designer and dev ako) tapos kinimkim pala niya yun. di ko nalang tinuloy yung pag-rebut ko kasi yung wife ko natatakot na magalit ako. i was very polite about it kasi mas matanda siya sakin and i was just looking out for her. then na-bring up nanaman ng kapatid ko about yung recently nangyari kay leila de lima. gagi nagulat ako sabi ng panganay niyang babae, ""dapat pinatay na nila yun. tinuluyan na dapat sinaksak."" sabay silang pamilyang tumawa (aside sa bunso na awkward sa situation) i felt chills. paanong nakakapag-dasal ng ganun kaganda tapos without any hesitations, would wish harm on other people just like that. ps. sinabihan din nung bbm tita yung mom ko directly bakit ako nag-cocomment and nag-popost na kumakalaban sa views niya. tas sabi ni bbm tita ""isang post mo nalang eh sasampalin na kita."" sabay tawa. eto din isang kinagalit ko sila yung traditional toxis filipino family. lakas nilang i-body shame yung asawa ko sa harap ko? muntik na talaga nag-liparan ang mga lumpia. anyways, officially cut ties with them na. may bbm supporter akong mga kakilala pero not that extreme (madalas dahil lang kasi ilocano. &nbsp; &nbsp; (edit) just to answer some questions. &nbsp; > quote q1. why was politics bough up nung dinner? i did not want to talk about politics because i knew it was going to be a mess, pero my sister thought our casual arguments sa fb nuon nung tita is civil and casual. she thought wrong. she had no idea the tita was extremely pro-marcos. she tried to change the topic but we decided na umalis bago magka-gulo (because i get really unpleasant pag nasimulan ko nang magalit and isa yun sa puna ng wife ko sakin kaya ayaw ko siya lalo ma-stress) anywho, lesson learned sa kapatid ko lol &nbsp; >quote q2. di bako sumagot or stoop up for what i believe in? i tried. di sa pag-tanggol sa pagkatalo or sa binoto ko, pero sa misinformation na nagbblur sa totoo at hindi. ang sagot sakin ""naniniwala ka kasi sa fake news. dun ka sa totoong balita lang. wag sa kwento kwento sa facebook at tiktok."" can't argue with people who always things they're right. siya nag-banggit na kay leni kami nag-vote last election and my side of the family all nodded (said ""yes. syempre tita."") then she proceeded to complain about the philippines being poor right now and then overcompensating sa pag-puri kay bbm after niya magreklamo. lol also i don't ever want to stoop low para makipag-sampalan at murahan sa harap nung bunso nila (na awkwardly listening to her mom talk about marcos. i guess she's the ""odd"" one in the family.) &nbsp; >quote q3. but they body-shamed your wife? di ka pumatol? as mentioned i can become harsh pag galit ako. my wife doesn't like me when i'm at that point of anger kaya we just looked at each other and signaled na umalis na. although i told them my wife is building strength kasi nag-ddeadlift siya. di nila alam ata kung ano yun. tbh nung tumahimik ako, napansin nung bf ng sister ko and akala daw nila may gagawin ako. i'm honestly surprised i held it in like that. i'm quite proud of myself. charot &nbsp; >quote q4. important ba sila sa inyo? nung bago-bago palang kami sa canada isa yung tita na nagshashare ng food niya samin sa work, nag-lolook out for us and genuinely concerned if we were okay. kaya masakit din na this happened. &nbsp; >quote q5. anong nangyari sa fresh lumpia? binigyan kami ng pa-take home pero wala na gusto kumain. binalik ko yung plate nila kahapon pero di ko na kinausap. iniwan ko nalang sa pinto nila. &nbsp; &nbsp; >quote edit: clarified that not all websites with ""https://"" are legit din.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/y1fwdi/my_thanksgiving_dinner_experience_with_a_bbm/,11 10 2022

Reality for Mobile Prepaid Users,"**tl;dr** recently, nagexpire at nadeactivate permanently yung sim card ko nang halos 15 years. apparently, mageexpire pala ang globe sim one day after maexpire ang load mo na may 1 year validity. nagulat ako dyan kasi alam ko days or even months before mangyari yun. i guess naging ganito simula nung naging 1 year validity ang load. dahil sa pangyayaring to, narealize ko na kawawa ang prepaid users kasi hanggang ngayon disposable pa rin ang trato sa kanila. i think outdated na yun given na sobrang big deal na ngayon ang phone number lalo na since may sim registration na na parang proof of ownership na rin. hindi naman lahat afford ang postpaid. wish ko lang sana ang next steps after ng sim registration act ay yung protection ng prepaid users. gawa tayo petition gamit hashtag #protectprepaidusersph hahaha so sa mga prepaid users dyan, bantayan nyo mga sim nyo para di matulad saken,haha **long story** nitong march lang, namulat ako sa reyalidad ng mga prepaid users. yung number ko nang halos buong buhay ko, nagexpire at nadeactivate permanently. gumuho ang mundo ko,haha. pero totoo, pag ang prepaid nagexpire o nadeactivate, permanent na yun. as in sasabihin nila sayo na wala silang process para ireactivate. actually may idea na ko about dyan dati pa. ang kinagulat ko yung condition kung kelan nageexpire ang sim. eto direct quotes from support ng globe tapos tinanong ko na rin yung smart globe: *""...please be aware that globe/tm prepaid sim card has its own validity period. your sim will expire 1 day after your one-year load validity expires. if you don't reload after fully consuming your load, sim will expire after 120 days...""* smart: *""yes, your sim will get deactivated if you didn't reload your sim after 120 consecutive days regardless the validity of your regular load.""* so ayun nga, as a long time prepaid user, alam ko lang na may ilang days or buwan before maexpire ang sim after mawalan ka ng load. apparently, nagiba na simula nung naging 1 year validity na ang load. isipin mo yun, 1 day lang palugit mo kahit 10k pa load mo basta nagexpire at nalimutan mo ng isang araw. tapos sa case ko pa, di ko alam kung malas lang ako at nagloko phone ko o may mali lang sa system ng globe kasi wala akong nareceive na warning na mageexpire na load ko o mageexpire na mismo sim ko. mga narereceive ko lang madalas yung ""we miss you"" promo text nila na nagooffer ng freebies pero magbabayad ka muna,haha nakapagtext pa nga ako ilang araw bago magexpire. **realization** dati ko na alam na pwede tong mangyari sa prepaid. kaya nga actually medyo gusto ko yung sim registration kasi iniisip ko makakatulong yun sa security ng sim ownership. yun nga lang, di rin ako natulungan kasi siguro masyado pang maaga, badtrip. pero narealize ko na outdated na talaga ang policy sa mga prepaid users. naiintindihan ko na ang original purpose ng prepaid ay para maging disposable solution pero kasi sobrang lawak na ng gamit ng phone number ngayon. halos parang id na rin sya na nakakonekta sa identity mo, lalo sa online presence mo. hindi na katulad ng dati na pag nagpalit ka ng number, send to all ko lang sa contacts mo na eto bago mong number. ang tanong lang pano mapupush na mabago to. obviously, walang pakialam mga carriers sa prepaid users. mahalaga sa kanila yung postpaid users. kaso kasi hindi naman lahat ng tao maaafford ang postpaid eh. nagcheck ako, parang minimum, 500/mo? kahit pa afford mo, di naman nagmamake sense sa lahat ng tao kasi iba iba tayo ng gamit ng phone. sana lang ang next steps sa sim registration act ay yung protection ng prepaid users. isa sa naisip kong pwedeng basihan ng sim expiration ay kung matagal nang hindi kumonek sa network yung sim. yun sure yun na hindi na talaga active.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/13fb779/reality_for_mobile_prepaid_users/,12 05 2023
"Long Hair, Adik","so some crazy stuff just happened and i'm still pissed. lumabas ako kanina para mag-apply sa trabaho. syempre feeling inadequate, matagal tagal ding natambay dahil sa lockdown, psyching myself up, halos di ko na nga mangitian asawa ko sa nerbyos. pagdating sa site, they said i need to secure a good moral certificate from the barangay. so i went. dayo lang ako sa lugar na 'to, decided to settle here just last december in this ""city"" where my wife grew up. hindi ko naman nasettle agad yung papers ko kasi nga, nalockdown. nagrent kami ng asawa ko ng isang room, and we've been here for about 6 months. i explained this to the people in the brgy hall. as in katabi lang ng brgy hall yung nirerentahan naming kwarto. they said kuha daw ako ng gmc sa permanent address ko. i explained again, dayo lang po ako dito, at meron naman akong cedula registered with my present address, and local lang naman po yung aapplyan kong trabaho. dalawang beses ako bumalik para humingi ng reconsideration. so they ushered me to the brgy captain. and shit went downhill. convo went like this: ""sino ka ba? taga-saan ka? di naman kita kilala, paano kita bibigyan ng good moral?"" ""sir diyan lang po kami nagrerent, kina (name of landlord). bale 6 months na din po akong naninirahan dito, may cedula na din po ako.""

""oh nakatali pa buhok mo, respetuhin niyo naman ang opisina pag papasok kayo."" i kept quiet. he went on. ""may ganyan ba? mahabang buhok? adik ka ata eh. nagmamarijuana ka ata eh."" nakatitig lahat ng employees sa akin. i pulled down my mask as he pointed fingers at me.

""hindi kita bibigyan, kuha ka sa pinanggalingan mo!"" i said ""okay thank you sir."" turned around and walked away. nakapagbitaw ako ng ""bastos"" habang papaalis. i told my wife what happened, she immediately called her aunt and uncle. said uncle is an attorney's son, pinag-uutangan ng buong barangay. we drove back to the brgy hall and was told the capt went home. we drove to cap's house. aunt talked with him, and he said ""trinatrangkaso kasi ako, hehe, binibiro ko lang siya, pag nagmakaawa naman siya bibigyan ko eh. kuha lang kayo dun, pirmahan ko dito."" we drove back to the hall and employees tried to tell us he was just in bad mood. apparently, okay lang naman pala, walang tanong tanong, gmc lang naman daw pala (mga hayop na alipores). kumuha ako ng apat, isa lang binayaran ko. when we arrived in cap's house, i went out to meet him myself but he didn't show up. pinirmahan niya sa loob ng bahay nila. paano ireport yung ganung klaseng animal? grabe, sobrang backwards mag-isip. wow, ganun ganun nalang, adik ka na. brgy capt lang yan ah. eh nung kumuha ako nbi at police clearance dati sa birthplace ko, di naman ako binansagang adik ng mga pulis dun ah. hayup men.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/h067hi/long_hair_adik/,10 06 2020

(at oo, nakakainggit kasi bukod sa di na niya dama ang covid19, super hot papi pa ang asawa niya.) unfortunately, i don't think i have that will. di ko kayang isuka ako ng pamilya ko, lalo pa ngayong alam kong di ko pa kayang tumayo on my own. kaya pilit ko na lang sinasarili yung sekswalidad ko kahit gusto ko nang aminin sa parents ko. another struggle din yung matindi kong craving for physical touch and intimacy. lahat ng ex ko, we can only do that kapag solo namin ang bahay nila/bahay namin, and that rarely happens. gustong-gusto ko ring maranasan yung may ka-holding hands ka in public or yung pupunta kayo sa amusement park, doing cutesy shits, and no one will bother you. o yung mahalikan ka kapag may fireworks display. o yung maisayaw ka kapag may nagpapatugtog ng sweet songs sa mga gathering like kasal. pero hindi e. i'm not thick-skinned enough to do that, and neither my exes. so, wala. we just keep it to ourselves. speaking of exes, ewan pero magnet din ako ng lalaking malibog lang, which freaking hurts kasi kahit ba mahilig din naman akong makipagtalik, i still date to look for a lifelong companion. pero wala. ang hirap. sometimes kapwa mo pa bakla/bisexual ang unang bigot na ma-e-encounter mo. i literally have a date who kept on saying he's straight kasi he never bottoms, so i ghosted him. sometimes, nakaka-feel ka ng intimacy sa sex friend mo, but you have to keep your feelings intact kasi hanggang libugan lang talaga ito. but my worst experience pa rin e yung may jowang babae at ginawa akong side bitch. i still get angry whenever i remember that, lalo pa noong sinabi niyang dapat daw magpasalamat akong siya pa ang nagyayaya sakin na mag-sex kami. i'm not a sex doll na parausan mo lang. i'm a human. i have feelings. you know, dream kong maging houseband doing a traditional wife role. lumaki kasi akong walang father figure so i wanna be a stay-at-home dad for my kids. besides, tamad din ako mag-work but i enjoy cleaning and cooking, so swak talaga sakin ang maging houseband. but i'm a guy living in an era na both parents have to work to support their family. i don't think magiging possible ang pangarap kong ito. sometimes, i wish i'm straight na lang. i guess less complicated ang buhay ko.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/my73nj/minsan_ang_hirap_maging_bakla/,25 04 2021
Is my friend asshole here?,"pauwi galing ng sm north yung friend ko. ilang oras siyang naghintay pero wala daw talaga siyang ma book. what he did was he approached yung mga habal na angkas riders. ang singil sa kanya was almost 3x ng fare doon sa angkas at joyride. since halos 3 hours na yata siyang naghihintay, pinatulan niya na. nasa p150 yata ang fare, pero p400 ang singil sa kanya. nag agree sila at nag proceed. ngayon noong nakarating na sila sa destination, ang binayaran ng friend ko is yung mismong fare lang doon sa angkas which is yung p150. what he did was, he intimidated the rider. hindi naman makapalag si rider kasi nasa lugar siya ni friend at may nag-iinuman pang mga kakilala niya. pinagsesermunan niya raw yung rider, told him na gahaman sila, mga mapagsamantala, at kung anu ano pa., minura then, pinalayas niya pagkatapos. he told us na hindi raw siya natatakot na ipag viral nung rider if ever man na nilitratuhan siya kasi sobrang dami raw galit sa mga riders ngayon dahil nga sa kalokohan at pananamantala. paniguradong yung rider pa ang mapapasama. for him, tama lang ang ginawa niya kasi hindi naman daw sila natraffic at doon sa p150 eh kay rider na talaga yun, walang bawas si angkas. sa tingin niyo, sobrang kupal ba yung friend ko sa ginawa niyang yun or justified lang? edit: definitely hindi ako to.. if only you know, duwag ako at hindi confrontational. baka manginig at magstutter lang ako kahit nakikipagtalo pa lang.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/zr3s9n/is_my_friend_asshole_here/,20 12 2022

The last BSKE solidified the thought in my head that the Philippines is f*cked.,"in our small barangay in the province, the choices for brgy. captains were a high school teacher with 20+ years experience, an engineer/government employee with 30+ years experience, a young psychometrician with about 5 years experience in politics, and the incumbent captain who finished high school and was the number 1 “kagawad” before shooting up to the highest position of brgy. captain after the previous one was “promoted” to a municipal position last 2022. ang nanalo ngayon ay yung incumbent. during the miting de avance, the first three candidates talked about their credentials, the service they have provided in their professional careers, and their platforms. the common denominator of their plans is accessible education. honestly, first time kong ma-invest sa barangay elections nang ganito kasi after almost 2 years of wfh, nakita ko talaga how our small barangay is doing, and it’s not good. so hearing the platforms, na-impress naman ako. sabi ko pa “may pag-asa na ata.” cut to the incumbent’s speech and it gave ✨nothing✨. sobrang disappointing, considering na s’ya ang current na nakaupo, at alam n’ya ang nangyayari sa barangay. pero you know what disappointed me the most? the whole theme of his speech was “hindi kailangang nakapag-aral, basta may nagawa na.” 🥲 i mean, nothing against people na hindi nakapagtapos kasi hindi sila privileged, pero ‘di ba mas okay pa rin na i-rally mo ang mga tao na magtapos ng school, then provide solution/support for them to be able to do so? tapos sinabi pa n’ya na hindi man s’ya nakapagtapos, marunong naman s’ya magsaka at mangisda, something na hindi raw kaya nung tatlong nauna. again, nothing against farmers and fisherfolk as my family are also like them, but like, anong connect?? nung national election na-feel ko na ‘to with what happened to leni and bbm. akala ko may nabago na kahit konti, wala pala. 😅 edit: 1. spelling. 2. to add as i've mentioned in one of my replies, the other 3 candidates have been involved in the community long before the elections. they participate in community events, they volunteer. they're known people in our barangay. the youngest of them is the former sk chairman. 3. to clarify, this is not my first time voting in the barangay level. i have voted before. i speak about the positives and negatives of politics in social media and irl. ngayon lang ako na-invest (attending rallies, house-to-house campaigns, and miting de avance), as in kinilala ko lahat ng candidates kasi ngayon lang nangyari samin na may naglaban-laban na ganito credentials. 4. the things i noted during the miting de avance speech to address the inaccessible education: a. setting up alternative learning spaces b. opening a public library c. conducting free reading sessions and tutorial services d. providing financial assistance e. trainings and workshops for potential and practicing teachers. basically yung 3 candidates, almost the same. meron ding providing assistance for tesda trainings/courses pero di ko matandaan yung exact assistance. 5. demographics of our barangay - around 10% na lang siguro yung farmers and fisher folk. i would say karamihan dito samin may ""average"" jobs (office worker, retail, may business, etc.) 6. incumbent captain's previous ""projects"" were fixing the street lights. legit eto lang talaga halos yung lalabas pag sinearch mo. (at meralco naman ang may initiative, di naman sya). nagka-issue pa nga sa isang subdivision dito samin kasi may isang galing sa kampo nila na nag-claim na yung street lights ay project ni kapitan, yun pala project ng hoa.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/17k6oov/the_last_bske_solidified_the_thought_in_my_head/,30 10 2023

Why do some foreigners have the audacity to discriminate against Filipinos….IN THE PHILIPPINES?,"this morning i was made fun of by a russian foreigner because of my skin color. so this weekend binistia ko ung kapatid ko sa apartment niya sa bgc. she has work on saturdays, so while waiting for her i decided to wait by the pool and open area located at the ground floor. everything was going great until these 2 russian kids together with, who i assume was, their dad arrived. pagdating palang nila sa pool area napansin ko na nakatitig na agad ung tatay sakin eh ako di ko nalang pinansin kasi baka curious lang. after a while, nag swiswimming na ung mga anak niya tas biglang napansin ko na titingin siya sakin tapos titingin sa phone tapos titingin ulit sakin. so parang ako taena ano problema neto. mga ilang minutes lumapit ung lalaki niyang anak tapos tumingin sa cellphone tapos tumingin sakin tapos tumawa?? then may sinabi ung kid na russian tapos parang nag gesture siya sa arms/ skin tapos tumawa silang mag ama. never ko naman kinahiya ung balat ko (medjo dark brown kasi ung skin ko) pero nung pinag tatawanan nila ako parang na conscious ako bigla. grabe, ako pa ung nahiya kahit nasa sarili kong bansa ako. di ko first time bisitahin kapatid ko sa apartment niya so sanay na ako na maraming foreigner dun pero okay lang kasi usually walang pansinan at walang pakailaman ng trip. anyway, after nun nainis ako so umalis na ako dun then later kwinento ko sa kapatid ko tas nag kwento siya na napapansin niya na bastos talaga ung family na yun kasi daw may time na nakita nung kapatid ko na sinisigawan nung kid ung yaya niya na pinoy din then nung sinita nung guard kasi bawal sumigaw sa lobby kinagat daw ung guard. nakaka disappoint din kasi di yun yung first time ma discriminate sa pinas. ung other time, nangyari naman toh nung 2nd year ng college mga 2018, ung block namin nasa bahay ng kaklase namin na chinese kasi may block project. napansin namin na ayaw kami kausapin ng magulang niya so akala namin na baka masungit lang talaga so di namin masyadong binigyan pansin. tapos nung mga gabi na dumating ung iba namin mga kaklase napagkataon na chinese ung mga dumating (may mga shifts kami kasi di kasya lahat ng tao dun sa bahay). tapos biglang ang bait bigla nung nanay niya? tapos pag nag uusap sila chinese lang di kami sinasama sa conversation. so bakit ka naman titira sa pilipinas kung gusto mo lahat ng kaibigan ng anak mo chinese?? okay lang ba sila? nakakarindi lang na ang kapal ng mukha nilang mang exclude and discriminate ng mga pilipino sa sarili nilang bansa.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/15p33op/why_do_some_foreigners_have_the_audacity_to/,12 08 2023

I joined a Grab Drivers group page and what I found is disappointing.,"i joined a grab driver's group page several months ago because i thought they accept posting basis bookings, well first i was wrong, they don't do that, that's too dangerous but i was too desperate. while the initial plan did not work out, i almost forgot that i got accepted into the group, it was just a harmless group at first, puro mga nagpaparent lang ng mga vehicle nila para makabyahe sa grab o kaya naman inquiry kung paano mag register as a grab driver. minsan pa nga mga humihingi lang ng tulong kapag na ticketan ng mmda kung ano ba ang gagawin. pero hindi palaging ganito. nashock ako dun sa ibang nakita ko. **first encounter, sleeping girl on the backseat.** there's a driver who took a photo of his girl passenger na natutulog sa backseat because she was too drunk. i mean okay lang naman kung gusto mag rant ni kuya, kasi at the first place may kasalanan yung lasing na hindi siya nagtira sa sarili niya but what bothers me is a grown man took a photo of a girl in his backseat na halos di mo na maintindihan yung upo and shared it to other men grab drivers in the community. caption pa niya >""nako mga paps paano ko to iuuwe hehe"" gets naman na harmless yung intention niya pero the fact that he posted that picture without the girl's consent. napa isip ako, shet pano kung ako yung nakatulog sa backseat at pinag uusapan na rin ako ng mga ito dito. there are people who argues naman with kuya driver na dapat kesyo hindi niya pinipicturan o kaya naman invasion of privacy. ang sagot niya? wala eh tutulog tulog siya sa grab. **second encounter, fake daw pwds.** sobrang gets naman na naghahanap buhay lang tayo lahat at gusto kumita pero yung to the point na galit na galit sila sa mga may discount na pwd sa grab kasi kesyo ""hindi naman daw pilay."" minomock nila yung may mga mental disorder kasi hindi naman daw yun pwd nakakasakay parin naman daw ng grab. although nagkaron na ng iba na nagsasabi na hindi dapat yun, ultimo nagpopost na sila na mali na imock yung mga hindi physical na pwd. yung thought and idea lang na kaya nilang sabihin yun dahil lang sa discount. may mga nag cicircle rin sa fb ngayon na conversation nila with a grab driver na hindi daw siya *mukhang pwd.* **third encounter, sharing of profile/information.** may mga grab driver na nirarant kapag hindi nila gusto yung passenger, which is okay lang? pero minsan talagang pinopost pa nila yung profile nung pasahero. which is mali? ang reasoning? para daw maiwasan. **fourth encounter**, **returning of items.** may mga success stories naman sa group page if nawala gamit mo o naiwan mo. pero may mga drivers talaga na pinipicturan yung gamit tapos sasabihin na tutal naiwan ang gamit ibig sabihin lagi na ginagawa. nakakatamad daw ibalik, sakanya nalang. hindi ko naman nilalahat yung mga member ng group page or all the grab drivers in particular. siguro may problema din sa management at system ni grab na ayaw nila ng discounts. hindi yata ganoon ka favorable yung trabaho para sakanila. understandable yun. nakakakilabot lang talaga yung idea na baka next time na magkamali ako kay driver na masakyan ko, ako na yung pinag pyepyestahan sa group page na to. edit: ito pala yung bagong policy ni grab para sa mga pwd/student at senior discounts. >”paps, sa kasalukuyan, si grab ang sumasagot ng diskwento para sa mga pwd, senior citizens, at students sa pamamagitan ng special promo codes. pero ayon sa regulasyon, ang discount na ito ay dapat sagot ng public utility vehicle driver and operator. kagaya rin ito ng ibang industriya gaya ng restaurants at supermarkets na nagbibigay ng diskwento para sa mga seniors at pwd. upang makatulong, pansamantalang paghahatian muna ng grab at driver/operator, 50%-50% ang discount. kaya mas mababa ang commission na kukunin ni grab sa taxi type na ito” >”ang 50-50 hatian na ito ng grab at ng driver-partner/operator ay sasailalim sa review by end of the year, bago gawin ang full transition na 100% na itong sasagutin”",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/15tc76i/i_joined_a_grab_drivers_group_page_and_what_i/,17 08 2023

Mindanao Independence is Impossible,"nabasa ko yung request ni pantaleon alvarez na kapag di daw tayo tumigil sa whatsover with china. magpupush daw sya sa independence ang gusto ko lang iparating sa kanya. 0% chance na mangyayari ang mindanao or visayas independence or both 1.) sa constitution pa lang natin specify na ang republika lang ang nag -iisang pamahalaan sa buong kapuluan 2.) 70% ng ekonomiya ng pilipinas nasa luzon pa lang then halos 60% ng visayas at mindanao ay nasa cebu city at davao city lang, sure na ang independent mindanao ay mababangkarote lang sa utang at mas mapapadali ang pag-unlad ng luzon 3.) yung milf at mnlf, di na nagpupursue ng independence para sa bangsamoro tapos itong mga visayan mindanaoans bigla magpupush? 4.) kung tatanungin natin ang 70% ng mindanao which are visayans. nasa 97% sa kanila not pushing for independence 5.) di na ganun kadali mag-declare ng valid independence ang isang lugar mula sa parent country nila. mas maraming bansa na ang kumikilala na dapat may consent at binding lagi sa parent state ang independence ng isang lugar na humihingi ng paghiwalay gusto nyo ba ng catalonia 2.0? 6.) us ally ang pilipinas. sobrang dali para sa pilipinas mag-request ng veto power sa united states kung gusto ng mindanao ng un membetship kayo ba may makikita ba kayong way para sa mindanao para maging independent sila?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/182l85m/mindanao_independence_is_impossible/,24 11 2023

I'm already a parent without adopting or getting pregnant 😔 mahaba to pero sana matulungan niyo ko,"hi. 29 na ko at may mga kapatid akong 8 taon ang tanda ko na magaaral at isang 8 taon ang tanda sakin na may anak na pero akala ata ay solo pa din siya. ang nanay namin ay halos senior na yung mga bata ay madalas naiiwan sa nanay namin dahil umaga ang trabaho niya (na may option for wfh) kahit na magkaiba na sila ng tirahan. at madalas ako ang kanyang katulong sa pagalaga ng mga bata kahit na may gustong puntahan si inay ay malaking problema lalo kung ako din ay may lakad. at kahit kausapin ang magulang ng mga bata ay parang kasalanan pa namin na hindi kami pwede at na may lakad kami. meron akong partner for 5yrs and naguusap na kami about marriage. ang medjo nagiging problema ko na dahil ang halos laging nakaalalay sa aming nanay, kahit mga plano ko o bakasyon ay apektado at naaantala. i feel guilty whenever kailangan o gusto ko umalis dahil pakiramdam ko ay nakakawawa ang aking ina. pero i somehow find it unfair na parang wala akong control sa buhay ko kahit na matanda na ako at kailangan idelay kahit ang pagpapakasal. at kahit magulang ko ay hindi makapagrelax ng dahil sa sitwasyon. ang sagot niya sakin kada knakausap ko siya about dito ay ""shempre apo ko yon. pag nagkaanak ka din, tutulong din ako."" na kahit sabhen kong ""tulong nga pero lumalabas parang nasatin na ang responsibilidad sa mga bata"" ay parang wala siya narinig. hindi ko alam kung paano ko ioopen up na gusto ko na magmove out o magpakasal dahil pakiramdam ko ay sknya mabubuhos lahat ng kakailanganin ng mga bata dahil nagaaral din ang isa ko pang kapatid. i feel guilty and bad dahil parang ang sama kong anak dahil sa gusto ko na bumuo ng sarili kong pamilya 😔 nabuntis ako noon 2021 but sadly lost the baby at pkiramdam ng nanay ko ay peer pressure lang kaya gsto ko ndn magbaby ulit dahil lang nabuntis din ang aking mga kaibigan. *may pcos po pala ako and gsto ko sana dn magkababy na dahil mahirap daw lalo pag lampas ng 30yo :'(* datirati ay nasasabihan pa na ""magbaby na kahit to follow ang kasal"", ""nasa edad ka na para magka-anak"", ""sana mabigyan ako ng babaeng apo* pero mdalas masama ang loob nya kada ako ay nagpapaalam para umuwi ng ilang araw sa bahay ng partner ko kahit pa sabihin kong *hindi naman pwede mabuo ng ""text s₱3rm to 2366"" lang* at dahil wala din privacy kung dito kami sa bahay niya para may kaagapay sa mga bata. pkiramdam ko din ay invalidated ang feelings ko at parang hindi ako pwede magdesisyon ng sarili ko dahil sa nangyayari hirap na hirap na ako magisip at ibalanse ang bagay bagay. mahal ko ang magulang ko pero pakiramdam ko na para bang ang kaniyang hiling ay iantala ko ang mga plano ko sa buhay para sa isa ko pang kapatid 😔 edit : nagtry kami magsuggest na magkuha ng yaya para may katulong sya sa pagaalaga dahil pwede naman sya sa bahay magwork. ayaw nya at kng ganon daw, sa nanay na lang namin niya ibibigay ang ibabayad sa yaya. isang beses lang yan nangyre at matapos nila magtalo noon, wala na ni piso siyang ibinigay. at kahit nalaman na may maintenance na ang magulang namin, ni isang beses ay hindi man lang niya ito nabilhan. 🤦",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/1621d0r/im_already_a_parent_without_adopting_or_getting/,26 08 2023
UV Express Story,"i rode a uv express along espana boulevard en route to fairview on a saturday morning. i was the first passenger and was greeted by a middle-aged driver who seemed tired from an overnight trip. few minutes during the ride, around 3 police officers in españa stopped the driver and assisted an elderly woman to commute. ""police to driver: boss, paassist naman si lola, mag isa lang, sm fairview. papunta bagong silang"" lola was helped by the police officers in looking for a ride, they opened the front door of the uv express and she was seated beside the driver. during the 45 minute ride, they had the most heartwarming conversation i've ever heard. *non verbatim* driver: saan po kayo papunta, lola? lola: sa fairview lang, uuwi ako sa mga anak ko. galing pa ako isabela, 4am nandito na ako sa maynila kaso wala pa rin yung sundo ko.. sabi susunduin ako 6am pero anong oras na. kaya ako nalang magbbyahe.. d: bakit naman po kayo nag-iisa, lola.. dapat may kasama po kayo. baka mawala pa kayo. ilang taon na ba kayo? l: ah naku hindi naman kailangan. 76 na ako. dati akong taga dito sa vicente cruz marunong naman ako mag byahe, tatawid sana ako sa kabila kaso sabi ng mga pulis dito na ako sumakay sayo papunta fairview.... mabuti mababait yung mga pulis dito, no? tinulungan nila ako. ito nga pala bayad ko... *hands cash to driver, but driver refused* d: wag na po, sa inyo na po yan. tulong ko na po sa inyo. bakit po kayo mag isa lang. wala po ba kayo ibang kamag-anak na kasama lumuwas? l: namatay na kasi mga kapatid ko, dalawa nalang kami nabubuhay, ako panganay, sa awa ng diyos malakas pa. kaya ngayon puntahan ko mga anak ko sa may bagong silang sila nakatira..... . may pamilya ka na ba? d: may mga anak din ako. maaga silang nag-asawa kaya may mga apo na rin. pero kumakayod pa din. di rin sapat yung kinikita sa pagpasada kaya may mga babayaran pa din. l: oh ito na nga ang bayad, pang tulong ko lang sayo.. d: hindi na ho, mas mahalaga makatulong. di bale na mapagod, ang importante nakakatulong din po ako... driver looking back to me: ikaw maam, ok ka naman dyan? ...i was engaged so much in their conversation that i forgot i was also part of the trip. me: ay ok lang po ako kuya 😅, dyan nalang po ako sa terraces bababa.... ikaw ba kuya, ok ka lang? driver: inaantok na nga po ako simula gabi pa ako nagpapasada pero pauwi na rin ako... pakisabay nalang po si lola pagbaba niyo sa terraces, sasakay papunta sa bagong silang. marami na jeep dun. then he stopped at ayala fairview terraces and tinuro pa kay lola yung mga jeep na pwede niya sakyan. before leaving, i secretly paid lola's fare and gave kuya driver additional tip. salamat po kuya sa pagiging mabuting tao. life realization: always be kind. salute to the driver who chose kindness and generosity. you deserve all the blessings in the world 😇 hoping to spread kindness and let's pay it forward.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/16vypb6/uv_express_story/,30 09 2023

"After two years, I visited EDSA and Makati again.","hi i am a probinsyano from central luzon 👋. i was based in mm before covid happened and never came back after. at ngayon na free na, i decided to travel again to visit dahil namiss ko (hehe) at to prepare if pababalikin na kami sa office. as i always practically take the buses, here is my commuting experience: 1. nabago na pala bus routes ng mga galing north provinces. hindi na pumapasok sa may cloverleaf to edsa, pero sa same station pa din naman ang babaan. sa mga baranggay na siya dumadaan. 2. may designated na babaan na sa edsa, barricaded, and most is sa tabi ng mrt stations. i found it organized pero grabe ang layo pala ng lakaran dagdag pagod pag sumabay sa init. kawawa ka pala kapag wala kang kotse sa edsa ngayon at hindi malapit sa station ang pupuntahan mo.for example sa boni, wala ng babaan so either ortigas or guada kana bababa. then lakad ka. 3. some roads were re-routed for example papasok ng makati, instead of 1 aircon bus to buendia lrt, you need to take 2 jeepneys na. hassle at pagod, lalo na sa mga papasok sa work. pero ang kagandahan one way na siya. dati kasi traffic doon lagi pag rush hour. 4. lastly pauwi sa province, sa edsa carousel, instead sa may footbridge, sa may q mart na ang babaan. grabe ang layo pala hahaha. di ko sure if magkadistansya sila ng mrt to provincial bus stations (victory, genesis, five star etc.). in conclusion, ang hirap pala bumyahe as a probinsyano ngayon na walang kotse. kung ako nahirapan, naisip ko lang what more sa mga araw araw na nagttrabaho na sa public transpo umaasa at senior citizens na naglalakad lng. ang tataas pa ng footbridge ng iba. though i am not sure if this has more advantages para ma ease ang traffic, pero in my opinion, siguro may other options pa to meet in the middle. iconsider ang mga normal na mamamayan at maimprove pa ang quality ng buhay sa maynila. feel free to correct me baka may schedules pala or mas convenient na paraan bumyahe po ngayon. friday to sunday kasi ako bumyahe. thank you for reading! 😊",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/t8fkp0/after_two_years_i_visited_edsa_and_makati_again/,7 03 2022

""hay salamat,"" sabi ko noong nakita ko na ang pinakahihintay kong ""blue line."" tulad ng nakagawian, matapos ang pagsukat ng temperatura ay pinapasok na ako. so pagod, gutom at kalamigan ng aircon ako ay natutulog habang nakasilip sa bintana. trenta minutos lang ay makakauwi na ako. napakalas ng ulan, mahirap makita ang mga dinadaanan. napansin ko na hindi pamilyar ang mga nakikita kong gusali. baka nagbago ng daan ang driver dahil sa baha. nais ko siyang tanungin ngunit ako ay malayo at siya ay nakakulong sa plastik na booth. naghintay-hintay pa ako at nakinig sa balita sa telebisyon tungkol sa quarantine. aabot na sa 15,000 ang may covid-19. mga tricycle ay limitado at hindi pinapayagan sa ibang lugar. nagugutom na ang mga pamilyang nawalan ng trabaho. gusto ko sanang mag *mobile legends* ngunit may kutob akong hindi dapat ako mag laro. hindi pa rin pamilyar ang mga nakikita kong bilihan at mga kainan mula sa bintana ng aking bus. paunti-unti bumababa na ang ilang pasahero at iilan na lang ang natitira. ilang minuto ako nagmasid mula sa bintana at sa kadiliman ng gabi't kasagsagan ng ulan bumati ang: *welcome to the province of rizal.* pauwi dapat ako sa marikina. hindi ko napigilang mapa-potangina. lumapit ako sa driver at nagtanong. doon ko nalaman nagpalit pala ng daan ang mga sasakyan ng kompanya ko at hindi ako nasabihan. may walong kilo ako ng grocery, malakas ang ulan, madilim, at walang ibang masakyan para ako'y makauwi. baha ang mga daanan ng aking ama at hindi kaya ng aming kotse lumusong.

Bisita sa Engkwentro (museong online),"ang engkwentro: sa (la) ysay ng diliman commune ay isang museong online na libreng at madaling maaccess sa ginhawa at kaligtasan ng inyong bahay. nakapaskil dito ang mga kaganapan ng diliman commune, isang pag-aalsa na pinangunahan ng mga studyante, mga propesor, at ng mga residente ng up diliman noong panahon ng martial law. sa pamamagitan ng interaktibong mapa at mga naitalang sanaysay para ka nang pumunta sa isang tunay na museo. pero pagkatapos kong bumisita sa mesuong online na ito na isip ko sa sarili ko, ano nga ba ang silbi ng mga ganitong website? matatanong niyo ang mga sarili niyo bakit ito ginawa? https://preview.redd.it/b7q2q6xzcz771.png?width=1904&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1fce4fb857942b261d116c01cc3696e43b71f0c ito ay ilang sa mga halimbawa ng mga nakita ko sa loob ng museong ito . sa unang larawan na ito ipinapakita ang simula ng diliman commune. hindi pa ito nababansagang diliman commune ng unang araw na iyon. sa unang araw pa lamang nagkaroon na agad ng nasaktan at nasawi pero imbis na matakot at matigil ang pagaalsa, pinalakas at pinatibay nito ang loobin ng mga umaalasa, at dahil iisa ang loobin nila mas naging epektibo ang diliman commune bilang isang porma ng rebolusyon laban sa pagwawalang silbi ng karapatang pantao. https://preview.redd.it/sh2rc1xzcz771.png?width=1904&format=png&auto=webp&s=c444335132ba715176891d733d96d3fc74269ba3 sa ikalawang larawan na ito pinapakita ang mga kaganapan ng ikaanim na araw ng diliman commune kung saan ilang araw nang hindi mga tao ang barikada sa up kundi ang mga silya ng mga silid aralan. sa loob ng barikada nagkaroon ng malayan talakayan ng ideya sa pamamagitan ng “teach-ins” at mga “discussion groups”. hindi man naging pormal ito pero kahit papaano nagawan nila ng paraan na maging maalam. https://preview.redd.it/4w4ls6zzcz771.png?width=1904&format=png&auto=webp&s=82597da64811ea54fbea5863fb55eed6475a214f sa ikahuling larawan na ito ay ang pagpapakita na sa loob ng up palaging may demokrasya tayong magkaroon ng malayang pahayagan na hindi natatabunan ng maginoo pagiisip. ipinapakita na kahit sa gitna ng mahirap na sitwasyon mahalaga parin ang pagkakaroon ng isipang malaya na hindi tumatanggap lamang ng impormasyon kundi kinekwestyon ang kawasto ng mga ito. sa panahon natin ngayon gamit ang social media napaka dali na mag bahagi ng mga ideya at saloobin tungkol sa kung ano man, mapa personal o kaya pampubliko pa ito, makakakita ka ng impormasyon kahit nakahiga ka lang sa kama mo. kaso sa sobrang dami ng impormasyon at ng mga pinanggagalingan neto mahirap na sabihin kung makatotohanan at mapagkakatiwalaan ang mga ito. minsan pwede mo sabihin na kilala mo at may tiwala ka sa nagbigay sayo ng impormasyon o balita. pero ganon parin ang pwede itanong sa sarili mo saan niya nga ba nakuha rin ang mga imporamasyon na iyon. kung sakaling nakaabot ka sa parteng ito ng aking mga sinasabi, sana tanongin mo ang sarili mo wasto ba ang mga sinasabi ko? sa punto ko nga naman ako ay isang tao lamang na nagbabahagi ng saloobin sa pamamagitan ng social media. walang kasiguraduhan kung ako ay isang mapagkakatiwalaan pinagmulan ng impormasyon. kaya sana tulad ng mga bumubuo ng komunidad ng up maging kritikal ka sa mga nababasa mo sa social media. subukan mong gumawa ng sarili mong pagsusuri at para masimulan yun subukan mo din bumisita sa mga museo katulad nito( [engkwentro: sa(la)ysay ng diliman commune (upd.edu.ph)](https://engkwentro.upd.edu.ph/)) na ang layunin ay ibahagi ang kasaysayan ng ating bansa. salamat!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/o9h79o/bisita_sa_engkwentro_museong_online/,28 06 2021
"The popularity of Upwork and other freelancing sites, and how it could potentially worsen our already bad economy","don't get me wrong. i have nothing against upwork. as a matter of fact, i'm also earning money from upwork. but let me just share my insight about this as a bs econ graduate. first of all, ano ba ang upwork and how does it work? basically, it is a freelancing site. maghahanap ka ng client, you negotiate, you turn your upwork tracker while working, you get paid based on the number of hours you worked for, you pay your commission fee, then you earn profit. since dolyar ang bayad dito, you can probably earn your previous daily wage while working in an office in an hour. because of the lockdown, maraming biglang naenganyo na subukan ito. marami ring pinalad. as a matter of fact, my friend who used to earn 20k/monthly as an accountant is now earning 120k for being a bookkeeper. laking ginhawa, hindi ba, especially considering na mas madali ang trabaho niya. kaso mayroon kasing malaking problemang kaakibat ito: dahil mas malaki ang opportunity sa upwork, marami nang ayaw bumalik sa previous set-up. and that is a big problem because it would cause *brain drain.* yup, the same problem na idinulot ng ofw. but wait, it doesn't end there. in fact, the problem is probably worse this time. you see, filipinos are generally underpaid in upwork. going back to my friend, she's charging her client $12/hrly, and according to [salary.com](https://salary.com), the average hourly wage in us for bookeeper job is $22/hrly. napakalaki ng natitipid ng american clients niya sa kanya. that's 80$ per day or $400 per month. hindi pa kasama ang mga mandatory benefits. now, let's go back to the brain drain issue. since magkakaroon ng brain drain, local companies would struggle to compete against upwork employers. their only option is taasan ang salary at benefits to discourage competitive employees to leave their work and switch to freelancing. sa bigger companies, no problem. but what about the smaller companies? most likely, they'll end up bankrupt. see, dito pa lang, meron nang malaking problema. we are making already rich countries like america richer while our own country will struggle to cope up. another problem: more cases ng tax evasion. i once attended a forum event hosted by bir, and according to them, there are at least 50% uncollected taxes from self-employed sectors. bilyon na halaga iyon. if more people go to upwork, it will probably increase. and you know, that is less opportunity to fund the feasible project. but that being said, i'm not blaming anyone on why we would rather go to upwork. sabi ko nga, ako rin mismo, nasa upwork na. currently, i'm earning just as much as i'm earning when i'm still teaching in college for less effort. totoo naman kasi talagang mas masaya mag-freelancing. so anong point nito? anong pinaglalaban ko? marami. first of all, syempre as we all know already, this problem arises because of the government's incompetency. one of the biggest bs on duterte's term is the so-called ""build, build, build"" project. bukod sa alam naman nating lahat na this is just an easy way for them to launder money, isa rin itong method to exploit the main loophole of ""economic growth"": expenditure. basically, the idea is tumataas ang ekonomiya kapag mas maraming ginagastos, without considering the fact na kung ang pinagkagastusan ba ay feasible at sustainable. the same method was exploited by marcos during his ""golden age of infrastructure"" na labis na pinagjajakulan ng mga pro-marcos. if the fund for bbb were instead used for real feasible projects like agriculture, transportation, health sector, and heck, kahit capital venture (gaya ng ginagawa ng qatar), e di sana lumago pa ang ekonomiya ng bansa. we can minimize the inflation while also improving the economic growth without relying to that bullshit bbb project. another factor to be blamed by this bs is yung working culture satin. mayroon akong tatlong napansin na nakakabwisit: **1. efficiency is frowned upon.** my first work is on an accounting firm, at dahil mabilis akong magtrabaho, sometimes it takes me 2-3 hrs to finish all of my tasks. you know what happens? bigla akong bobombahin pa ng trabaho. kahit labas sa work description ko gaya ng paglilinis ng office or pagso-sort ng files, ipapagawa sakin. so what i did para di mautusan ng ganyan? i work slowly, which results to inefficiency, at sobrang nakaka-burnout iyon sakin **2. ""3-in1 employee for a salary of one"" culture** kailan lang ay mayroon akong nakitang job hiring. the title is ""layout artist"" pero ang trabaho? layout artist, photographer, customer service representative, social media manager, and e-mail handler. five-in-one! tapos ang salary, 14k. o diba parang tanga lang. sinong hindi gaganahan sa ganyang kultura. i might as well add na uso rin yung promotion pero walang dagdag sahod. ano yun? pampaganda ng resume? **3. office politics** kailangan ko pa bang i-explain? usong-uso ang siraan sa office lalo na kapag may promotion. &#x200b; the verdict of this long-ass post? in macroeconomics perspective, the popularity of freelancing culture in the philippines is detrimental to our economy, but we are not at fault here. all of us would do whatever it takes to survive after all. however, it doesn't mean we should accept it as it is. our first step should be electing the right politicians. also, we should stop tolerating the bullshit office cultures in the country so to encourage more people to get back to the old setup.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/phtdjm/the_popularity_of_upwork_and_other_freelancing/,4 09 2021

(chants of walang tulugan). katakut-takot na kape ang uubusin natin. mula po nang nagsimula ang kampanyang ito…ang uniteam po ay 6 na buwan nang umiikot sa buong pilipinas at dala ang mensahe ng pagkakaisa. dala ang mensahe ng pagmamahal at pagtutulungan ng bawat pilipino. dahil po sa aming pananaw ito ang kailangan natin sa panahon na krisis kagaya ngayon. at tinanggap po ninyo ang mensahe namin tungkol sa pagkakaisa. naunawaan po ninyo kaagad na ang pagkakaisa ay magiging bunga ng pagmamahal ng pilipino sa isa’t isa.marami na pong nakabanggit sa dami nang problemang ating hinaharap. marami pong nakakaalam at nararamdaman kung ano ba ang mga dapat tugunan na dala nang pandemya ng krisis ng ekonomya na likha ng pandemya. kami po ay patuloy naming isinisigaw ang pagkakaisa. at ang ating mga kababayan, kayo po lahat ay napakadali sa inyo na maunawaan ang pagkakaisa dahil nasa inyo ang puso ng tunay na pilipino. ang puso na nagmamahal sa kapwa. ang puso na nagmamalasakit sa kapwa. ang puso na nagmamahal sa ating bansang pilipinas. dahan-dahan po ay dumadami po ang sumasama sa atin. dahan-dahan po ay naririnig natin ang sagot ng ating mga kababayan sa sigaw ng uniteam ng pagkakaisa. at ito po ay noong nagsimula kami 6 na buwan na po. noong nagsimula kami ang sagot na narininig natin ay parang bulong lamang. halos hindi po marinig. habang tumatagal po ang panahon, nakikita po natin na yang bulong na yan ay palakas nang palakas. habang dumadami ang nagsasanib puwersa sa likod ng kilusan nang pagkakaisa. hanggat ngayon na maliwanag na maliwanag na ang sigaw ng pilipino. at ang sigaw ng pilipino ay nauunawaan namin. ang pagkakaisa. nauunawaan namin ang pagmamahal. kaya’t kami ay kasama sa pagkakaisa. kami ay kasama sa pagpapaunlad ng pilipinas. kami ay kasama sa pagpaganda ng buhay ng bawat mamamayang pilipino. kami ay kasama sa kilusan ng pagkakaisa. dito po natin makikita ang tunay na ugali ang kultura ng pilipino na nagmamahal sa kapwa. dito po natin makikita ang tunay na pagmamahal ng pilipino sa ating minamahal na pilipinas. kaya naman po ang ating sinasabi ay hindi tayo dapat magtaka. dahil po alam natin ang ugali ng pilipino. ang ugali ng pilipino ay mapagmahal. ang ugali ng pilipino ay may malasakit sa kapwa. lagi ko pa na pag-iikot namin lagi ko pong sinasabi na ang tunay na puso ng pilipino ay tutulungan ang kanyang kapwa kapag naghihirap. ang tunay na puso ng pilipino ay magbibigay ng kanyang kamay upang makapagdulot man ng tulong at ginhawa kung isa ay natisod na at nadapa na pilipino. alam naman po natin na ang ugali ng pilipino ay maging mapagmahal hindi lamang sa kapwa kundi maging sa bansang pilipinas. kaya naman po kami po ng uniteam, ng tambalang marcos duterte, kami po ay umikot upang lumapit sa ating mga kababayan at hlingin sa inyo ang inyong suporta. hilingin sa inyo ang suporta para sa aming mailuklok ang aming magagaling na opisyal. para aming masimulan ang pagkakaisa ng sambayanang pilipino. at dumadami na po ang sumanib puwersa dito sa kilusan ng pagkakaisa. ngunit meron po akong napuna. kami po ay tumakbo sa ilalim ng adhikain ng pagkakaisa. hiningi namin po ang suporta ng ating mga kababayan. at ibinigay po ninyo at nagpahayag kayo ng suporta. nagpahayag kayo ng tiwala sa marcos at kay duterte at pati na sa uniteam. kaya’t gumanda po ang pag-asa namin na pagdating ng halalan baka naman kami ay mabigyan ng pagkakataon na simulan ang pagkakaisa ng pilipinas. ngunit po hindi pa po tayo nakarating sa halalan. hindi pa po tayo wala pa po tayong napasyahan na mga kandidato na mamumuno sa darating na ilang taon. ngunit ang taumbayan po ay hindi na po nag antay sa halalan. ang taumbayan po nung marinig ang mensahe ang aming adhikain ng pagkakaisa ay sinimulan na ang pagkakaisa kaya’t ating naramdaman na ang buong pilipinas ay dahan-dahan nang nagkakaisa. kayo na ang mga mamamayang pilipino ang nangunguna dito sa kilusan ng pagkakaisa. habang kaming mga kandidato ay nag aantay ng suporta. nag aantay na sana kami ay maging mapalad at makaupo. ang taumbayan ay hindi na naghantay at ipinalabas ulit ang tunay na puso ng pilipino at sinimulan na ang pagkilos ng pagkakaisa kaya naman po napakaganda po ng naging pagsanib puwersa ng lahat ng pilipino. kayo na ang nangunguna sa kilusan ng pagkakaisa. kami po ay nagsisilbi sa inyo upang ipagpatuloy ang inyong sinimulan. upang ipagpatuloy ang dahan dahang pagkakaisa ng sambayanang pilipino. upang gawin ang lahat upang dumating ang araw na masasabi natin ang mga pilipino ay muli nagtatrabaho. ang mga pilipino ay may pera na naman sa bulsa. kaya na namang ipakain ang kanilang mga pamilya. kayang pag-aralin ang kanilang mga anak. at iyan ang inaantay natin na araw. na masasabi natin na dahil sa pagtutulong natin sa isat isa nararamdaman na natin na tayo habang nasa krisis man kahit nasa krisis pa lang ay tayo ay dahan-dahang nakikita natin na gumaganda ang buhay dahil lahat tayo ay kapit bisig lahat tayo ay pilipino, ipinagsasama ang tapang, ang sipag, ang galing, ang kakayahan, at ang pagmamahal ng bawat pilipino. inaantay natin na masabi na dumating na ang araw na tayo ay masasabi natin na tayo ay napagsama-sama natin ang mga pilipino. napaganda na natin ang buhay ng ating mga kababayan dahil tayo ay tumulong. dahil tayo ay nagkaisa. at pagdating ng araw na iyan ay tayong mga pilipino ay magmamalaki ulit, sasabihin sa mga ating mga kaibigan sa buong mundo “tingnan ninyo kami mga pilipino, dumaan sa krisis, at hindi kami nakaraos lamang kami ay sumikat pa at nalampasan natin ang ating sitwasyon bago pa nagkaroon ng pandemya. pagagandahin pa natin at tayo darating din sa araw na iyan na kapag tayo ay nagsanib puwersa, tayong mga pilipino, na tayong muli ay haharap sa buong mundo at sisigaw sa ating mga kaibigan at iwawagayway ang ating bandilang pilipino. at sasabihin natin, at ipagmamalaki natin, at isisigaw natin “ako ay pilipino, taas noo kahit kanino” yang hangarin na iyan, yang layunin na iyan ay kayo aking minamahal na mga kababayan, kayo ang magdadala sa bukas na mas maganda sa pagkakaisa ng sambayanang pilipino. mararamdaman po natin yan, mararating

ilang taon. ang hiling ko lang sa inyo, ay huwag ninyo pong kalimutan ang ating pinag usapan dito sa anim na buwan na kampanya na ito. huwag po nating titigilan ang ating sinimulan. huwag po tayong hihinto. at lahat ng ating lakas ay ating isakripisyo. ang ating buong puso at dunong ay ibibigay natin sa ating kapwa. ihahandog natin sa ating minamahal na pilipinas. alalahanin din po ninyo na ang suporta ninyo para sa uniteam, para sa tambalang marcos duterte ay di lamang suporta para sa mga kandidato. ito ay suporta para sa pagkakaisa. ito ay suporta para sa pagunlad ng pilipinas. ito ay suporta sa magandang kinabukasan. kaya’t pagdating ng lunes pagpasok po ninyo sa inyong mga presinto ay isipin ninyo kung ano ang ninanais nating kinabukasan para sa ating mga mamamayan. ano ang ating ninanais na kinabukasan para sa pilipinas. at sa ganoong pag-iisip ay umaasa kami sa uniteam, na tambalang marcos duterte umaasa kami na kami ang mapupusuan ninyo dahil sa uniteam niyo lang narininig ang pagkakaisa, ang pagmamahal at ang pagsasama-sama ang ating minamahal na mga kababayan. gawin na po natin ang nakasulat sa ating mga placard. sama-sama tayo sa tagumpay. sama-sama tayo sa tagumpay sa darating na halalan sa lunes. ngunit sama-sama rin tayo sa tagumpay ng pagkakaisa ng buong pilipinas. iyan po ang aming naging pangarap. mukha namang dahil sa inyo, dahil sa inyong mga minamahal kong mga kababayan malaki po ang pag-asa na makakamtam po natin. maaabot po natin. magagawa po natin para sa pilipinas yan. at kapag ating nagawa ito, asahan ninyo na tayo ay maaalala natin kung saan tayo nagsimula. maaalala natin kung ano ang ating nilakbay upang dumating dito at kung ano pa ang ating ipinagpatuloy para sa pagkakaisa. at mararamdaman po natin kung tayo ay tuluyang magmahal sa isa’t-isa, kung tayo ay tuluyang magmahal sa pilipinas, sama-sama po tayong babangon muli. maraming-maraming salamat po. mabuhay ang

Woes of a Kakampink OFW,"last year i had a falling out with my family. very vocal kasi ako na kakampink ako. i was the only kakampink in the family, aside from my 14-year old niece. but she can't vote, so her posts about leni were always the butt of the joke in the family group chat. 'ang bata bata mo pa, akala mo naman may alam ka!', they would say. i would post leni's advocacies and they would put 'haha' reacts to it. hinayaan ko lang. election came and went, bbm won, sara won, but i never shut up. post pa rin ako nang post sa facebook calling out how they blatantly steal from the filipino people. they would comment, pero hindi na ako pumapatol, 'haha' react na lang pabalik tutal ganoon lang din naman ang ginagawa nila kapag wala na silang masabi to defend bbm. pero hindi na ako nakapagtimpi when they told me to shut up because i was not living in the philippines. hindi na ako nakatira sa pilipinas, pero ramdam na ramdam ko pa rin ang hirap dahil nagpapadala ako sa kanila. it's as if nawalan ako ng karapatan dahil wala ako doon, pero ako naman ang gumagastos para sa kanila? 'manahimik ka na, wala ka naman dito!', pero pagdating ng bills ng kuryente, wifi at tubig, sa akin hihingi. 'manahimik ka, di mo naman alam mga nagagawa ni bbm dito!', pero kapag wala na silang makain, sa akin tatakbo. 'shut up na, sa ibang bansa ka naman nagttrabaho!', kahit philippines pa rin ang hawak kong passport at pilipino ako. i'm in the process of acquiring a new citizenship in a year. hindi na ako makapaghintay hindi maging pilipino. para manahimik na talaga ako. dumating sa punto na php 200k ang naipadala ko sa isang buwan sa kanila. yung pang grocery at pambayad ng bills, suddenly, kulang na kulang na. pero shut up daw ako kasi wala naman daw ako sa pilipinas. edit: naoverwhelm ako sa dami ng comments. - why would they bite the hands that feed them? gaya nga ng sabi ko, do not underestimate people's audacity. it's the 'anak ka lang namin, wala ka dito sa mundong ibabaw kung hindi dahil sa amin' mentality. - bakit nagpapadala ka pa? my 8-yr old sister isn't independent. malaki ang padala ko kasi may sakit siya and kailangan ng meds. sinubukan ko na yung sa kanya lang padaanin pero ang sagot eh 'di ako marunong magwithdraw', 'di ko alam yan eh'. - you get what you tolerate. takot akong maging mag-isa sa buhay, probably, dahil alam kong kapag cinut-off ko sila, lahat, including extended family, damay. siguro di pa ako handa maging mag-isa kaya takot ako magcut-off. may matitira naman, mga pinsang bukas mag-isip pero ilan ilan lang din. once i get my new citizenship, kukunin ko na yung mga kapatid ko (i have a brother na mas matanda pero ignorante rin; kukunin ko pa rin siya dahil naniniwala naman akong with proper education mamumulat sila sa kung ano ang tama). edit 2: some shit went down earlier kasi sinunod ko yung isang comment dito na ipost to sa facebook. i will update kapag tapos na kami sa confrontation. ilang oras na kami nagchchat and i tried to call them, nirereject at sa chat na lang daw kami mag-usap dahil baka raw di nila ako matancha. hahahahahahaha.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/16p0yni/woes_of_a_kakampink_ofw/,22 09 2023

Sharing our experience in a public hospital,"hello, naka admit kami right now sa isa sa pinaka malaki na public hospital sa manila for two months already. and hindi pa rin namin sure kung when kami lalabas because of my mom’s condition. i just want to share our experience from the time that we are admitted up until today. • guards are super rude to the point na kami na pasiente hiyang hiya kapag sinisigawan kami. minsan na pag tritripan kami. for example: pina aalis sa plastic container yung mga ulam at ilipat sa plastic, vice versa. • palakasan is real! kainis nakakaiyak kasi parang kailangan namin mag makaawa para lang matignan kami. • always check you bills. naka kita kami ng mga items naka charge sa min na never namin na received. • last, doctors here are only friendly when they’re getting money and following their orders. you can’t question them. if you do, ma pa galitan ka lang. this is just our experience, it could be different from others but so far it is unpleasant. yung situation sayo ang papatay hindi yung sakit mo. edit: about sa doctors na we question, we question them kasi there are three doctors na nag check up sa mommy ko, all them have different diagnosis sa mom ko. dr. a say na okay everything is fine, walang further test na gagawin. dr. b say na my mom is critical. while dr. c say na eto yung sakit ng mom mo at eto yung mga dapat gawin. since mag kakaiba sila ng sinasabi at yung mga procedure ay salungat din. we asked them bakit mag kakaiba kayo ng sinasabi? and their response was, gusto namin mapabuti ang pasyente, in demeaning and condescending way. but they never answered our question na bakit sila mag kakaiba ng diagnosis sa mom ko.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/16wwypj/sharing_our_experience_in_a_public_hospital/,1 10 2023

Paano kayo nagccope up sa pagkawala ng mahal ninyo sa buhay?,"it's been 2 weeks since my father died. sobrang bilis, ang lakas niya pa lang tapos bigla na lang siyang nastroke. sabi ng doctor niya makakauwi na siya, pero yung day na dapat uuwi na siya ang day ng libing niya. hanggang ngayon, hindi pa rin mawala sa isip ko kung may pagkukulang ang mga doctor ni papa. doctor ni papa na cardiologist ang humawak sa case niya, nadiagnose siya ng hemorrhagic stroke, pumutok ang ugat sa utak niya at kailangan pigilan ang pagkalat ng dugo. sobrang confident namin sa doc ni papa kasi sabi magaling daw, ang sabi after 5 days ic-ct scan ulit si papa. ang lakas ni papa kahit nung 1-2 days niya sa icu. inaalis niya pa ngt sa ilong niya and malikot ang left side niya though hindi niya magalaw ang right side ng katawan niya at hindi namin siya makausap. 3rd day ni papa sa icu, sinabihan siya ng doctor niya na makakalabas na siya ng icu ng thursday (saturday ng madaling araw na stroke si papa at nadala namin siya agad sa ospital). at sabi, saturday makakauwi na siya sa amin. ayan ang advise ng doc niya sa amin bago umalis ang doc ni papa at nagseminar o may pinuntahan sa ibang bansa at iniwan sa isang doc na iternist. that day, nanghina si papa. ang dating malakas na grip na kamay niya at malikot niyang paggalaw ay humina... akala namin okay na... sobrang taranta na namin at late na na may nakapagsabi sa amin na kakilala na bakit walang neurologist si papa. kailangan daw niya neuro. late rin namin nalaman na cardio and internist doctors lang humahawak kay papa. before that, tanong na kami nang tanong sa mga nurses. nagtanong pa kami bakit hindi pa ict-scan si papa dahil nanghina siya. ang sabi, hindi na raw kailangan daw lalabas na siya. binawasan din mga gamot niya. kaso ang sabi nagka-infection daw siya sa dugo dahil hindi mawala ang lagnat niya kay binigyan siya ng antibiotics. thursday nang malaman namin na walang neuro si papa at kailangan niya ng neuro. pinilit namin na ipatingin si papa sa neuro kahit na nagagalit na samin mga nurses. cardio raw ang kailangan ni papa at hindi neuro. pinapirma kami ng waiver na kami ang nag-ask for neuro at hindi ang doctor ni papa. turns out, nang icheck siya ng neuro bakit daw hindi na-ct scan agad. dapat 2-3 days na ct scan daw ulit para malaman kung namaga utak ni papa. mali pa raw ang antibiotics na ibinibigay kay papa, sobrang baba raw dapat daw malakas dahil sa utak nga daw ang problema ni papa. thursday night, bumagsak katawan ni papa. ang gcs niya from 10 nang dinala namin siya sa ospital to 3. kumalat na daw ang dugo sa utak ni papa as per result ng ct scan sabi ng neuro niya baka kailanganin niya ng surgery. that night, sobrang bumaba bp niya, naging abnormal heartbeat niya at super nahirapan siyang huminga nilagyan na siya ng tube. super sakit akala namin makakauwi na siya tapos friday ng madaling araw nawala na siya. super sakit, before siya mastroke pinag-uusapan pa lang namin graduation ko. sabi niya super proud siya sa amin magkakapatid. ngayon hindi na niya ako makikitang ggraduate....yung panganay niya, walang tatay sa graduation. hindi ko alam kung may pagkukulang mga doctors niya or what, until now di pa rin namin nassettle ang bill. ang hirap magsalita kasi di naman kami expert pero para sa akin may pagkukulang sila. hindi ko sila sinisisi pero ang sama-sama ng loob ko!!! may times na parang okay na, pero kapag naaalala ko si papa... ang sakit-sakit, sobrang miss ko na siya. sobrang miss ko na ang papa ko. unang anak niya na mapapagraduate niya ng college, hindi niya makikita... kahit na mahirap, pinag-aaral niya kaming apat. ang sakit-sakit pa rin... hindi ko alam paano magccope up sa pagkawala ni papa...",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/14hwjjn/paano_kayo_nagccope_up_sa_pagkawala_ng_mahal/,24 06 2023
Ang hirap ng buhay sa Pilipinas. (personal experience),"nang magkaroon ng pandemic, nawalan ng trabaho ang papa ko. dahil dito, nawalan kami ng perang pambili ng mga gamot niya na siyang dahilan para 4 months siyang hindi makainom. nagkaron siya ng infection sa loob ng katawan at kailangan siyang dalhin sa hospital pero hindi namin nagawa dahil wala kaming pera. may bukol naman ang mama ko sa kanyang dibdib pero hindi rin namin mapa-check dahil wala kaming pera. and for some reason, 'di namin magamit ang philhealth ng papa ko kahit sa buong buhay ng pagtatrabaho niya ay kinakaltasan sila. last week lang nakapagpacheck up ang papa ko at may bagong gamot na naidagdag sa maintenance niya. nagkaroon na ng trabaho ang papa ko pero 1,000 lang ang sweldo niya per week. nakakapagtinda kahit papaano ang mama ko. pero hindi ito sapat para sa aming gastusin dahil sobrang mahal ng mga bilihin. nahihirapan na ako sa online class dahil nasira ang laptop ko at 4,500 ang pagpapagawa. ang mahal rin ng internet/data. bsa student ako at kailangan naming gumamit ng excel. hindi ko na alam ang gagawin. salamat sa iyong pagbabasa. pasensya na kung mahaba. sadyang wala lang akong mapagsabihan at sobrang bigat na niya sa pakiramdam. nawa ay nasa maayos kang kalagayan at hangad ko ang iyong kasiyahan. salamat muli. edit: marami pong gusto humingi ng gcash ko po. edit: magandang araw po sa lahat. hindi ko po ine-expect na maraming gustong tutulong sa akin. ang tangi ko lamang pong hangad ay mailabas ang bigat ng nararamdaman ko po. ako po ay tiga-laguna at hindi po talaga kami makapunta sa ibang lugar dahil po sa pandemic. sa prostrate po ang sakit ng papa ko at hindi ko po alam ang sa mama ko. lcd po ang sira ng laptop ko po kaya hindi ko po maipagawa dahil mahal daw po ito. hindi ko po siya maibenta para makabili ng 2nd hand dahil ito po ay regalo sakin ng papa ko noon kay gusto ko rin po maipaayos. salamat po. i appreciate you all po. ps: ibagsak ang imperyalismo, pyudalismo at burukratang kapitalismo.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/lqaf95/ang_hirap_ng_buhay_sa_pilipinas_personal/,23 02 2021

Creatures of Philippine Lower Mythology,"reading this book it details the physical attributes, magic and power, capabilities and domiciles of philippine lower mythological beings like demons (kapre, tikbalang) aswangs, witches, mermaids and engkantos. the book taps the history of pre-colonial philippines. the book also explore the comprehensive effects of these creatures in the daily life of filipinos. positive man or negative. while some filipinos believe in the existence of these creatures, some may not. i personally believe that science should triumph over superstitious or primitive beliefs. that everything has a logical explanations be it sa pagkalampag ng bubong (dahil dinapuan ng aswang ang bubong) or itim na aso na umaaligid sa bahay ng may sakit. however, nakakaaliw din magbasa or makinig ng mga stories tungkol sa aswang, mangkukulam, engkanto, tikbalang and etc. so bilang malapit na ang halloween at bilang batang pinanganak ng early 90s na part ng school life yung pinagkwekwentuhan ang mga kwentong kakatakutan kapag ganitong buwan…drop your stories here (narinig man or naexperience) about these creatures of the night.",https://i.redd.it/15237my7qysb1.jpg,8 10 2023

Truth why children struggles for reading comprehension in my POV,"i have worked part time as an assistant for my late mother when she was a teacher until she became a principal so i think i'm qualified to post this at least. so bakit nga nagiistruggle ung mga bata especially reading comprehension, what's happening within the school system and this is what i observed for 8 years i have worked in deped. 1. teachers are being worked for community services like feeding programs. imo dapat lgu services ang gumagawa nito not teachers. isa ito sa mga matrabahong ginagawa nila kaya nababawasan ang attention sa bata. pinakahassle dito ung liquidation which really drains the life out of you. 2. teachers are being worked for data reports instead of adding an employee for the task. isa ito sa mga pinakaiinisan ng mga teachers. not just time consuming, nakakalito pa sa dami ng data kailangang ipasa sa deped within a short period of time. the higher-ups mentality: kung ayaw mo humanap ka ng ibang trabaho (what a nice way to motivate teachers amiright?!). this job causes teachers para tamarin ng magturo, imbes na lesson plan ang inaatupag nasa data reports na, kaya paggawa ang grades ng bata dinaig pa na galing sa rekto para hindi na sakit sa ulo. also teachers have a hard time adjusting to technology especially yung mga nagstart pang nagturo since 90's era na nasanay na sa papel kaya madaming pinaparework na reports which again causes them to advert their attention from the students. 3. ito masakit: deped really doesnt give a fuck about children performances. totoo naman eh, they only care about the data they demand from the schools wether it is invented or not basta napirmahan at naaprubahan bahala na yung bata kung marunong o hindi. ang bottom line ng mga teachers kung bakit imbento na yung grading especially sa reading comprehension dahil sa reasons 1 & 2 (dagdag mo pa yung mga bata na ayaw matuto). also matrabaho ang magparemedial reading at apektado din grades mo as a teacher dahil mababa ung grado ng reading comprehension ng bata habang naghahabol ka ng data reports ng deped(o diba ang dami). so anong solusyon? ipasa mo nalang kahit hindi marunong. wala man lang akong nakitang employee na nagveverify ng reading comprehension ng mga students. basta ang kalakaran as long as papers goes it goes. 4. corruption in deped and broken promises. my mother (school principal) and her teachers are always promised laptops since 2017 pero walang dumadating. during their seminars laging pinagmamalaki ng regional supervisor for this annual budget at magkakaroon sila ng makabagong gamit. welp never happened, outdated parin laptops ng mga teachers, i think 2015 pa ata ung models na ginagamit ng mga teachers dito ofc im not going to disclose the location. this mostly started during duterte's term pero nung kay pnoy madami laging bagong learning materials at libro hindi pa masyado uso laptops noon. demanding ang deped pero hindi progressive yan ang katotohan sadly. out of touch ang higher-ups sa mga front liners kaya tayo umabot sa ganito. teachers works are overloaded and demanding yet underpaid. so kung may opinions pa kayo just comment down below.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/wsv9x2/truth_why_children_struggles_for_reading/,20 08 2022

Short Tagalog Story (I hope you like it),"i'm in a creative mood so i thought of writing a short story. mga anito ng maynila **sa may simbahan ng binondo** nakatingin ang babae sa kalesa at sa kabayo na nakapwesto sa harap ng simbahan ng binondo. may maliit na ngiti sa gilid ng kanyang labi. “sakay kayo?” tanong ng kutsero sa babae. “di ko akalaing makakita ako ng ganito dito.” sabi ng babae. “konti na nga lang mga kalesa dito sa maynila. kung gusto nyo ng ikot lang pwede na ang tatlong daan, pa gabi na din kasi.” “salamat, pero di ko po sila kayang sakyan.” “dalawang daan?” “salamat pa rin po.” tumango ang kutsero at bumalik sa panonood sa kanyang cellphone. “hanapin mo ako.” bulong ng babae sa kabayo bago maglakad pa alis. **sa isang murang hotel sa soler st.** nag ring ang telepono sa room 314. “mam, may lalaki po dito hinahanap kayo.” “paki patuluyin mo sa kwarto ko.” “bukas yan” ang sagot ng babae pagka katok sa kanyang pinto. “nakita mo ang ilaw ng kandila?” tumango ang mama. “pwede ba?” tanong ng lalaki nung binunot nya ang pakete ng fortune. humindi ang babae at tinuro ang “no-smoking” sign sa kwarto. “nagulat ako nung nakita kita kanina, di ko inakalang may… kagaya mo dito sa siyudad.” “at di ko din inakalang may manananggal na bibisita sa siyudad at tumabi pa sa simbahan.” “walang epekto ang simbahan sa akin, taga panga-alaga pa nga ako ng mga santo sa amin. kung alam lang ng mga tao dun.” tumingin tingin ang lalaki sa kwarto. may kandilang itim na naka sindi sa maliit na lamesa at may maleta na may sticker ng cebu pacific na galing tagbilaran sa sahig. “galing ka ng bohol?” “sa loon. nakita ko ang pangalan mo sa kalesa. richard nga ba ang pangalan mo?” tumango ang lalaki. “ako si avelina pero lina na lang itawag mo sa akin” “ano ang pakay mo dito?” “hinahanap ko si bathala.” “di na sya ang bathalang tulad ng dati.” “nandito nga sya? kaya mo ba akong samahan papunta sa kanya?” nagisip isip si richard at walang maisagot sa babae. “may sakit ako at konti na lang ang oras ko dito, sya na lang ang pag asa ko.” “sasamahan kita sa kanya, pero wag ka magugulat sa makikita mo.” bumaba papuntang lobby ang dalawa at lumabas ng hotel. kahit lagpas alas-onse ng gabi ay madami pa din mga kotse sa kalsada. “malayo ba sya?” “walang deretsong jeep papunta sa pwesto nya, lakarin na lang natin.” sarado na ang mga tindahan bukod sa mga 7-11 na nadaraanan ng dalawa. nakapag sindi na din ng sigarilyo si richard habang nag lalakad. “matagal ka na dito sa maynila?” “mga tatlumpung taon na.” “alam ng kutsero kung ano ka?” “oo, mabait ang pamilyang yun sa akin. yung kutsero kanina, anak na yun ng may ari ng kalesa.” “meron din kagaya mo sa bohol, pero sa ibang lugar sila nakatira. may kilala akong apat na kagaya mo doon.” “ikaw pa lang ang manananggal na nakita ko dito sa loob ng apat na taon. may nakilala ako dati na nagging flight stewardess. mahilig yata kayo talagang lumipad.” “di ko yata kaya ang mawalay sa mga tanim at alaga ko. parang ikaw, mukha naman kuntento ka na sa pamilyang kumupkop sayo.” “araguy!” napatigil ang matandang babae dahil sa sakit sa tagiliran. inalalayan naman sya ni richard. “mabilis sana kung lumipad tayo, pero di ko alam saan ang pupuntahan natin.” “di mo ako kayang bitbitin, manang” “akala mo lang, tikbalang” “malapit na din tayo, ulitin ko lang, wag ka magulat sa makikita mo.” tumango si avelina sa sinabi ni richard. nakarating sila sa quiapo church at naglakad patungo sa mga eskinita sa tabi nito. may tindahan ng mga halamang gamot at iba rito ay nasa botelya. “pampa-regla” “gamot sa eksema” mga nakadikit sa bote. may matandang lalaking panot at mabahong natutulog sa tabi ng tindahan na ito. “sya ang hinahanap mo” sabi ni richard kay manang. lumuhod si manang kay bathala at binaba ang ulo. umubo si richard para magising si bathala. walang nangyari at patuloy lang sa pag hilik ang matandang lalaki. tinapik na ni richard ang upuan ng lalaki kaya ito nagising. nagulat si bathala ng makitang si manang avelina na nakaluhod sa harapan nya sabay tingin kay richard. “hoy kamusta, richard? buhat na dyan, di mo kailangan gawin yan, basta may pambayad ka may gamot ako dito. hula ko hindi pampa regla ang kailangan mo.” “bumyahe pa yan mula bohol para makita ka.” sabi ni richard. “meron po akong sakit at kailangan ko ang tulong nyo.” “ano ang sakit mo?” at kinuwento nga ni manang avelina ang kanyang mga sintomas at nakinig naman si bathala. “pasensya ka na, pero wala akong maitutulong sa sakit mo. mga gamot na mabibigay ko ay pantulong lang sa kirot pero di ito mapapahaba ang buhay mo.” “naniniwala pa po ako sa inyong kapangyarihan. baka pwede nyo pong gamitin ang kapangyarihan nyo sa akin.” natawa si bathala. “nakikita mo ba ako? tatlong araw na akong di nakakaligo at nagbabantay na lang ako ng tindahan na ito. dito ako natutulog dahil wala akong bahay. alam mo kung bakit ko piniling pumwesto dito sa simbahan ng quiapo? para maramdaman ko man lang na ako ang sinasamba ng mga tao pero hindi ako ang sinasamba nila kaya’t wala na akong kapangyarihan. ang mangilan-ngilan na kapangyarihan ko sa mga mangigilan na bumubulong ng pangalan ko sa kanilang dasal ay binubuhos ko sa mga gamot na to.” “alam mo sinasamba ng mga tao ngayon? pera. wala din ako nyan. mukha bang malakas ang bentahan ng pwesto ko? pero bebentahan kita ng gamot dahil di pa din ako kumakain ng pang gabi. itong isang bote na to, 350 na lang. inumin mo to isang kutsara sa umaga at isa sa gabi para sa sakit. pero ulitin ko, di ka nito mapapagaling.” kumuha ng pera si manang avelina sa kanyang pitaka at ibinayad kay bathala. “salamat! bumalik ka, hija! at kung maari, babalik na ako sa tulog ko. richard, daan ka ulit dito minsan. kwentuhan tayo.” “salamat pa rin po, dakilang bathala.” at naglakad na pabalik patungo sa hotel ang dalawa. “ayoko man isipin at ayokong maniwala, pero pera na nga yata ang kapangyarihan ngayon. yun na din yata ang sagot sa sakit ko.” sabi ni lina habang naglalakad pabalik. “at least kung may pera ako may pang ospital ako.” “kung di ka din matutulungan ni bathala at pera din lang pala sagot sa problema mo baka hindi si bathala ang pinuntahan natin.” “sino?” “si pilandok” hope to be continued",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/vy5jhx/short_tagalog_story_i_hope_you_like_it/,13 07 2022

i attended some Ang Dating Daan sessions last weekend,"attended their bible expo/bible study last friday and the leader bro eli soriano just started spewing stuff like, marcos was the best president, martial law was very good, wala daw mga drug addict, safe ang daan. mga suwail sa gobyerno at mga komunista lang naman ang umayaw. even saying that marcos deserved the libingan ng mga bayani burial because he was an ex president and is entitled to it. then said na imposibleng nagnakaw si marcos ng bilyon bilyon kasi hindi naman daw ganun kalaki ang funds na pwede nya makuha as president that time????? (isang malaking ??????) gave it another chance the next day in their thanksgiving bec my husband was insisting i go again.... guess what. then they said na kaya daw wala masyadong ncov19 cases sa pilipinas dahil sa taal volcano eruption. pinaputok daw ng diyos yung taal to save the philippines from the virus, apprently they are saying na ash fall can kill/prevent the ncov virus. and as expected paniwalang paniwala yung mga members? palakpakan after! the logic is just ????? i mean? so pano na yung mga namatay, nawalan ng tirahan dahil sa taal eruption? mag thank you pa dahil solution yun ni god for the ncov thing? my god. edit 1: found a copy of their bible expo sa youtube.

"Para sa mga Dentista dito, kailangan po ba ng Xray before tooth extraction??","ok so here’s what happened. i have anxiety and depression, at naging sandalan ko kumain ng matamis na pagkain. but before you judge me, yes, i brush my teeth properly 2-3 times a day. unfortunately, nanalo ang sugar and sobrang natakot ako dahil yung molar ko sa right side may butas na. nagka lakas loob na ako around second week of december 2022, magpa check sa dentista after almost a decade. and yun na nga i have 1 impacted tooth (#17 ata yun), 3 dapat pastahan, and sinalihan na ng cleaning. so ayun nagpa schedule ako to tend to my impacted tooth for 15k, and the rest 4.5k kahapon ng january 10, 2023. pag upo tinanong ako if may x-ray ba daw ako. naturally, i said wala dahil wala naman instructions na binigay sa akin. so ayun pina buka na ako ng bunga bunga and dere-deretso na nga. ngayon, nagtaka ako kase akala ko talaga yung right molar ko na may butas ang bubunutin, pero yung left molar ko pala and wisdom tooth! and sobrang sakit ng procedure, di man lang ako naka prepare mentally sa mangyayare. anyway, sobrang sakit during and after. plus na lock jaw ata ako dahil more than 10 minutes ko di ma close yung panga ko. after everything happened, nag linger pa rin yung question na “may x ray ka”? dahil, 1. dapat ba meron? 2. if meron man dapat, at di ako nasabihan (kasi nga dec pa ako nagpa check up) ano ang pwede or dapat ko gawin? 3. di na ako comfortable sa kanya so di na ako nagpa pasta and di ko na pinagalaw yung isa kong molar na may butas. dapat ba akong lumipat ng dentista? thank you so much po sa maka sagot! if may part man sa kwento ko na di clear or kulang sa info, pls feel free to ask lang po. and pasensya po talaga, this might be my anxiety talking pero di ako maka tulog. 😔",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/108gcz0/para_sa_mga_dentista_dito_kailangan_po_ba_ng_xray/,10 01 2023

Permanent WFH Setup: Filipinos Should Look Into Virtual Assistant (VA) Industry,"i want to share this here hoping that it could help some people who are tired from the daily commute that they have to endure just to get to work. marami pa ibang dahilan bakit gusto mag wfh ng isang tao katulad ng: * kailangan mag alaga ng anak o kapamilya na may sakit o matanda na, * malayo ang bahay sa trabaho kaya gusto makatipid sa pamasahe/gas, * estudyante na gusto ng pang allowance/tuition, * may sakit pero kailangan pa rin magtrabaho para may kita, * etc. virtual assistant (va) is a general term that refers to freelancers working **remotely** for **foreign clients**. merong mga freelancers na hindi remote workers (e.g. photographer, model, insurance agent, etc.) kaya wag ka malilito sa term na ""freelancer"" at ""va"". vas yung mga nagtatrabaho sa bahay, sa coffee shop, sa beach, kahit saan kase ""remote worker"" sila. never nila poproblemahin ang return-to-office (rto) order kase nasa ibang bansa yung client nila. anong pwede maging trabaho ng va? depende sa designation. a va can be a/an: * administrative assistant, * architect, * auditor, * bookkeeper, * content creator, * customer service representative, * graphic designer, * human resource, * it personnel * paralegal, * seo specialist, * social media manager, * web developer, * writer, * etc. halos lahat ng designation pwede ma-categorize as va basta permanent wfh + foreign client. just like traditional jobs, you need to apply for the position, undergo interview, training and you can be laid off too due to poor performance, bankruptcy, world crisis, etc. > pros ng pagiging va 1. permanent wfh setup 2. flexible hours (depending on the contract) 3. salary in foreign currency 4. lower tax rate 5. work-life balance > cons ng pagiging va 1. you need to be tech savvy to start in this field, 2. saturated market. madami gusto mag wfh ever since nag pandemic, 3. no ph government benefits, ikaw magfa-file ng taxes mo at magbabayad ng contributions mo as self-employed, 4. no hmo, 13th month pay and bonus **unless** mag agree kayo ng client na meron 5. you need to be independent and resourceful kase kung gusto mo tinuturo lahat sayo at wala ka initiative matuto mag isa, mahirap. short story: i became a part-time va (social media manager) in 2016. i worked with an australian client but i left after 6 months kase mababa ang sahod tapos lakas mag micro-manage and nag focus na lang ako sa pag aaral. tumigil ako ng ilang taon, kinalimutan ko na, maliit naman sahod. in 2019, few months before covid lockdown, i tried again because school expenses are hurting my pocket. this time, i am a full-time va (administrative assistant) for a us client. my starting salary was php22,500 and then it went up to 25k to 27k to 50k. i was promoted to operations manager and started earning php100k a month. after graduation and during bar review, i continued working. when i passed the bar exam in 2022, i told my client that i will leave the job so i can focus on my legal career. he does not want me to leave so he doubled my salary from 2k usd to 4k usd (php200k a month). he also pays for our medical insurance, 13th and 14th month pay, monthly bonus and gadget upgrade. currently, i have 2 jobs: va and my traditional job. mahirap ang buhay. kung kaya mag double job, grab it. you can learn to be a va through: 1. reddit (r/buhaydigital) 2. facebook (online filipino freelancers page) 3. youtube 4. other vas 5. google hindi kami hiring ngayon, wag nyo i-send saken resume nyo. protect your identity, this is reddit. i am just hoping that this could help someone who wants a permanent wfh setup. sobrang pahirap yung public transportation system sa pilipinas, and it will take years and good leaders before we see improvements. that's it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/w8j318/permanent_wfh_setup_filipinos_should_look_into/,26 07 2022

angkas app cancels my booking,"i could be wrong. i have two numbers registered in angkas. i often use my smart number. nung lumuwag na uli ang protocols, sobrang tagal na mag booking (20mins +). kinacancel ko na lang and nag te train na lang ako. i cancelled a bunch of booking awaiting rider acceptance. now, everytime i book a ride, automatic na nag pop out na ""no riders near my area"". so mag train na lang which will take me 1.5h to get to work. the problem is, sandamakmak na angkas riders ang nakikita ko sa labas ng building namin waiting for their passengers or just traveling to and fro. didn't mind it at first, pero this happened a lot of times na that i cannot use my angkas app na. tinry ko na rin mag book sa labas ng building namin, literally just looking at the angkas drivers na nag da drop ng customer nila. just the same, no riders in my area. i updated the app, thinking that maybe it will fix the issue pero same thing pa rin. so i decided to use my globe number instead. i rarely use it for angkas thus, no track record of cancelation in between booking. lo and behold... i finally got a ride. tldr: cancelling your bookings might indirectly, block you from angkas by using pop outs na walang rider within the area when in fact, meron pala. cancelling covers those cancelled bookings awaiting rider acceptance. hindi yung cancelled despite being accepted by rider. i don't cancel when i have a ride. i don't have any issue at present. i was just wondering if bug ba to or is this normal sa across ride sharing app. kala ko kasi kina count lang nila yung nag cancel ka if in accept nanni rider.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/zwv363/angkas_app_cancels_my_booking/,28 12 2022

Para sa mga nagvolunteer at umatend ng mga rallies...,"at sa mga nakisama in spirit, thank you for your efforts! on a lighter note, maiba lang tayo, share naman kayo ng heartwarming stories or experiences nyo this campaign period. nakakanerbyos kase yung mga nangyayare lately, let's make this thread full of good vibes and positivity. i want to hear stories of people giving rides, sharing lumpia, cupcake or water, or finding lost wallets. may bago na ba kayong friends? may nagkainlaban ba? yung isang friend ko, sumama sa rally kasama buong pamilya, nahiwalay sa anak at saglitang nawala yung anak. thankfully, nahanap naman. pero hanggang kinabukasan, tinetext siya nung mga nakilala nyang kakampink tinatanong kung nahanap na yung anak niya at maaari silang tumulong kung hindi pa. sobrang ramdam daw niya yung sincerity and yung kagustuhang tumulong. nakakataba ng puso. i've seen a lot of posts about yung hirap iconvince ang mga kamaganak or magulang. i see your frustration, and i guess it gave me a newfound appreciation for my family. they have always had strong political views, to the point where it has put our lives in danger. but they have always stood for what is right. and they fight for what is just. we are martial law victims. there are pains and trauma that transcend time and get passed down to further generations. may mga dinakip nang walang sapat na rason, kahit menor de edad. there was no due process in court. may tinorture, kinulong. may ""napatay"". mga magulang na naglibing ng anak. may dinakip at kinulong kasama ang mga maliliit na anak. mga batang tinutukan ng baril. may mga tumandang may mental health issues kase naka bug yung telepono sa bahay at matagal na under surveillance yung bahay. yung papadalhan ka ng mga litrato ng bahay mo at ng anak mo suot kung ano yung suot niya an hour ago. or yung every now and then may sumusunod sa sasakyan mo. may espesyal na panghampas para bugbog na yung laman mo pero walang pasa. may buntis na pinaghubad at pinaupo ng maraming oras sa bloke ng yelo hanggang makunan. yung bigla na lang papasukin yung bahay mo, raid daw, pero kukunin lang nila ang mga valuables mo at tataniman ka ng incriminating evidence. gang rape, hindi yung pinipilahan, kundi sabay sabay. at marami pang pangyayari na iisipin mo sa pelikula lang nangyayare. we feel strongly about the elections now, because of what we have gone through. so for those who tried enlightening their friends and family, please don't give up. even after the elections. continue to tell your stories, continue to share facts. ipaalam ang tungkol sa mga resibo. who knew decades after the martial law ended, we would be back to fighting another marcos? yes, we didn't tell our stories enough, we didn't teach the others enough. because some thought that what transpired was so inhumane and so unjust that the people couldn't possibly forget the atrocities of the marcoses. and now look where we are. but despite these experiences, friendships were forged. and at a time of darkness and violence, several young teenagers bonded over their political views and love for country. and yes, some fell in love with each other. some of those who survived have paired up and have been married for almost 40 years now, raising children with equally strong political views. these children are now adults, actively participating in political discourse. so, on a lighter note, please share your positive experiences or lessons learned. while we wait for election results, let this thread be full of hope, good vibes, and stories of new friendships formed. and please tell me, may nagkainlaban ba diyan?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ulm5ta/para_sa_mga_nagvolunteer_at_umatend_ng_mga_rallies/,9 05 2022

Should I go back to the Philippines?,"hi, i'm a 26-year-old male and an accounting graduate from a university in quezon city. right after graduation, i reviewed for the board exams with my friend in cpar. she passed the exams, while i didn't even take the boards that year. i really regret that decision, at least to the extent that i can feel that the people around me is somewhat disappointed in me. ""a brilliant individual"" is how people around me often describe me. but somehow that changed after that one decision that i made in 2018. my family started to treat me like someone who couldn't make any rational decisions. but what i really can't forget is what my professor in college told me the last time we met, about 6 months after the october exams. he said: ""alam mo sayang, ka magaling ka pa naman top ka sa klase ko."" at that moment everything sinked in na realize ko lahat lalo na yung mga opportunities na sinayang ko. simula noon pakiramdam ko di nako nakarecover yung motivation ko at unti unti ring nawala yung mga reasons ko na magtake ng cpale. the following year, i tried to do a self-review for the board exam in may but ended up bailing again. my reason at that time was that i needed to review pa kasi gusto ko sa top 10 ako, which is the same reason why i didn't take the exam in october of the previous year, as noong nag preboard ako, that in october of 2018, i was only on top 19. my thinking at that time was that if i gave it some effort, maybe i could enter the top 10. kaya from october 2018 to may 2019, naging october 2019 ng finally nagtake nako ng exam and failed, puro reasons ginawa ko at lagi kong reason di pako nakakareview di ako prepared kaya di ako magtatake, but the more na dinelay ko for more time to review, eh wala namang pagrereview na nangyari, ni hindi ko nabuksan yung libro kahit isang pahina. the truth is ang hirap mag aral magisa lalo na kung yung naging motivation mo lang to finish the course is your friends. so that october, after not reading or solving any accounting-related materials, i took the boards. at that time, bago mag-exam ang yabang ko, pa sabi ko sa sarili ko, what if pumasa ko, how cool will that be after more than a year of not studying? not surprisingly, i failed that october 2019 cpale. i ended up not having a job for 2 years because of my stupid decisions, and after i failed the boards, i was really devastated. mostly because i failed, and that failure was a result of me not giving my best. yung kaya ko naman kaso di ko pinahalagahan yung mga privilege nabinigay sakin, 3 consecutive review centers na fully paid ng parents ko na bihira lang ako pumasok at may allowance and condo pa. ang dami kong sinayang na habang tumatagal na rerealize ko na tama yung prof ko baka nga sayang ako. after 2 years of being depressed, i finally had the courage to go out again and find a job. but at that time, my confidence level was so low that i didn't have the guts to apply for an accounting-related job. i felt at the time that i didn't deserve it, so i applied to a bpo company instead. i did a great job there and was awarded as one of the top employees in my first year. pero di ako masaya pakiramdam ko, i don't belong there, na hindi yun yung para sakin araw araw, i'm questioning myself: ""anong ginagawa mo dito"". the following year, i received the devastating news that my friend had died. my friend's father told me that she died because of an illness that was misdiagnosed, and because covid cases were high during that time, she wasn't able to go to the hospital regularly to be checked. this was hard on me because she's the one i looked up to when i was in college; she's the one who got herself all figured out, the complete opposite of me. she was like my anchor when i was at university. you see, she's very smart, hardworking, and even finished college with a full scholarship. she's also the ""panganay,"" so she has all these hopes that someday she'll be successful and be able to help her family. so being with her somewhat motivated me to study. i'm a very laid-back person, and she always kept me in line, reminding me that i can't get everything in life so easily and that i should work hard to get what i want. so when she died, that brought me to the worst point of my life. it's just so hard to think about all the things she will never be able to do or be. i was thinking up until now that maybe if i found out sooner that she was having medical problems. i could have referred her to my uncle. i have all the resources to help her, but i didn't because i thought she was alright. i could have helped her with the medical bills so that her family wouldn't have to struggle so much. i just can't accept the fact that she died because no hospital will accept her because they thought it was covid. it was a very curable illness; it's just that it happened at the worst time. right after her funeral, i decided that i would do everything she told me that she wanted to do. so i quit my job, booked a plane ticket, and traveled to thailand. that country na gustong gusto nya puntahan ever since, but di nya napuntahan. pero habang nasa thailand ako, i felt really sad; narealize ko na she's the most precious person in my life, and that i do love her. i had all these regrets bugging my mind all throughout my stay there. nasana kung di ko sinayang 4 years ng buhay ko magkasama sana kami now. or at least, man lang, i made the effort to spend more time with her before she died. ang daming what ifs, and that happened because i was so engulfed in my own sorrows that i didn't even bother to check on her; in fact, she was the one always reaching out to me. but everything is too late now. kaya ngayon nagdecide ako na hindi lang yung dream destination niya yung puntahan ko kundi pati narin yung mga bagay na di nya natupad ay tuparin ko para sa kanya especially her dream of us becoming a lawyer. i'm currently traveling and wandering around asia right now as a backpacker and working as an esl instructor for a couple of months in different countries. right now i've decided to finally quit my job and go home and try to fix my life. gusto ko tuparin yung lagi nyang sinasabi na magtake ako ulit ng cpale at this time; gawin ko na yung best ko. and when i pass, i'm planning to go to law school for her to fulfill one of her dreams. i hope this is the right decision now. and maybe someday i can be the person that she has always wanted me to be.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/128v23u/should_i_go_back_to_the_philippines/,1 04 2023
I failed to be a good sister,"i have no one to talk to right now and i think writing here will help me get this out of my chest. so i have a younger sister and she's 15 while i'm 19. she's a 'typical' teenage girl. mahilig siya sa wattpad, tiktok, ig, vlogs, make-ups, shopee, k-dramas to the point na dun lang umiikot yung araw niya. we're total opposite. she follows trends, i don't. i'm good at acads, she's not. what i really dislike is the fact that she's so lazy that she doesn't attend online class because she didn't wake up. every time na may inuutusan siya sa bahay palaging 'wait lang' ang sagot gamit ang mataas na tono na halatang naiinis. she talks back to me and my father too. she doesn't know any household chores. araw-araw lang siya nakahiga sa kwarto at nagcecellphone. maldita pa. sobrang naiirita talaga ako pero never akong nagalit sa kanya. i think that she acts that way because she's still young. next school year, shs na siya pero hindi niya alam anong gusto niya sa buhay. my parents separated last year in a good terms pero nakatira kami parehas kay papa. she hates talking to mom and she'll do everything to avoid it. yesterday, inutusan siya ni papa bumili ng food supplies pero nawala niya yung pera. i was tired because of cooking and attending a class when i learned what happened. i wasn't that mad but i got really mad because when i asked her when did she think she dropped it, she responded using a higher tone. siya pa yung galit and it happens every time na kinakausap ko siya. she's spoiled and i hate it so much. i unintentionally yelled at her ""letse naman *insert name*, bahala ka dyan. ang tanga kasi, hanapin mo yun."" i know i used hurtful words and i felt bad. after couple of minutes, may bumili sa tindahan namin habang naglalaba ako pero di niya pinagbentahan. nagkulong lang siya sa kwarto. hanggang magvideo call si mama and ayaw niya pa rin lumabas kahit tinatawag ko siya so i confronted her. i was mad again so i said ""ano na naman bang kaartehan 'to. ikaw pa galit..."" i was shocked at her answer, sabi niya ""sige, saktan mo ko. di mo alam nasasaktan mo na ko. "" tapos umiyak. my father heard us so he scolded my sister bakit daw sumasagot sakin and such. dahil maldita yung kapatid ko, pumasok siya sa kwarto pero iniwan yung cellphone niya. i felt guilty that she was hurt because i yelled hurtful words at her so after an hour kinausap ko siya and ibabalik ko na rin yung cellphone niya. i'm the kind of person who hates conflict. i'm quiet too and i rarely get mad. i found her crying in a corner. i said sorry and explained that i was tired too. but her answer shocked me more. she said, ""wag niyo na ko pakialamanan."" i wanted to cry too because she's too immature. i was explaining things to her while she was crying but she just said ""di niyo alam nangyayari sakin."" i think that i really failed as her sister because she grew up like that. but i'm tired too. i'm getting tired of her. i'm getting tired of understanding her. right now, i just don't want to talk to her anymore but i'm scared that she's depress or something. the other thing that bugs me is that she's just being dramatic because of what she reads and watches.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/kdkn73/i_failed_to_be_a_good_sister/,15 12 2020
Inaccurate Portrayals of the Provinces,"i've always been bugged by the fact that a lot of movies portray the provinces inaccurately. kalimitan, yung pag portray sa probinsya, mga bahay na walang electric at water connections, mga made of kawayan/nipa yung mga bahay, radyo lang form of entertainment, etc. tapos, minsan ang pagportray pa sa mga probinsyano na pumupunta sa manila, yung oa na parang napunta ibang planeta. guys, especially yung mga taga luzon, di na po ganyan sa probinsya. we also have cities here. of course not on par with metro manila pero di naman kami ganon ka atat ng mall na as if first time palang namin makapasok dun. we have smartphones, malls, internet connection, water, cable/sat tv, electricity, basically kung anong meron sa manila/luzon area, meron na rin dito. oo kahit 7/11 at puregold meron din dito sa amin. hell, may miniso at h&m nga dito eh. kahit nga sa mga interior mismo na probinsya, may mga cellphone/tv naman yung mga tao dun, may kuryente na din, all though yung water connection is a bit of a problem. a bit of a suggestion to filmmakers/playwrights/radio artists/ or any kind of story-telling artists here, i'm not saying that you should abandon your notions of ""probinsya"", because truth be told, compared to manila and to an extent, luzon, the other parts of the philippines are still pretty behind. but we aren't that overly backwards, guys. please just portray us and the places where we live in more accurately. and please, mag effort naman kayo if your movies involve some local dialects like bisaya. madalas ang pangit kasi ng pronounciation tsaka diction, nagiging katawa-tawa pakinggan. sorry if mahaba and if ever i offended some of you. may mga bad experiences lang talaga ako with some manilenyos/ luzon residents looking down on us coming from the vismin areas.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ghts1j/inaccurate_portrayals_of_the_provinces/,11 05 2020
I think I'm losing everything.,"(first time doing this and writing on reddit to express how i feel, so bear with me.) pandemic and recent election period really take a toll in my well being. i was in a 6yr relationship and it is really weird and complicated. we tried to avoid topics such as beliefs and politics. but recently (as i always did naman since 2016 pa), i decided to stand up and fight and be vocal for what i think is morally right. to cut it short, she belongs to a religion which just recently endorsed the corrupt and the thieves. so, we call it quits a while back pa and cut off our communication because i know she would follow their so called 'unity voting'. as of now, i'm trying to be productive and focus on things that really matters. pero still you know, bad news, surveys and mostly disinformation on other social platforms gives us more anxiety and make me lose hope. aside from politics and relationship, my career and family is next on the line. i'm now resigning for my current work to pursue better career opportunity and going back to my parents' home to work remotely. problems are, i cannot focus well and breathe freely around my father alam niyo yon? he's a loyalist and i feel terribly sad he was enslaved by fake news peddlers for years now ever since that boi b/b/m lost in 2016. i sometimes took the blame or like it's my responsibility to help them not consume fake news because i work in it industry and i somehow know how information or mostly disinformation spreads on facebook and youtube. i tried to explain to them about their data and fb ads, cam/bridge analy/tica and all those 2016 election fiasco. i feel like i was fool while telling those things to them. also, the reason i wanna go back home is i wanna be with my mother ever since she worked abroad as ofw, she recently came home for good. so i thought, gusto ko makabawi sa panahon na wala siya and when i needed a mother in my side when i'm really down and longing for a mother's touch. but yea it's hard to go home. i'm also thinking about moving on to different place again and not move back to my parents' since i am living independently rin naman ngayon. but you know, living alone also took a toll on my head for years now. i cannot sleep well at night, i sometimes procrastinate and play games until 2-3am. i had lost my enthusiasm on the things i'm really good at. my 2018-2019 me is better than what i am right now. it affects my career and my skills and just struggling today. so it bugs me a lot on where to go and where to start. so ayon, i feel like i'm losing everything. i'm losing her again and again because of me fighting for democracy. i don't know where to go and i feel like i don't belong in anywhere as of now. i'm losing myself and still trying to figure things out. lahat ng yon, there's this small hope and faith inside me, for our fellow citizen. kahit ang hirap hirap and we feel like we're alone in this battle. internet communities, m04d, all those wholesome/bardagulan kakampinks fb pages and etc. i'm still holding onto hope. next time na magsusulat ako dito hopefully, i'll be writing some good news na. salamat sa pagbasa nito at nakaabot ka pa dito. para sa pilipinas. 🌸",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/uinzvl/i_think_im_losing_everything/,5 05 2022

I don't like the hugot/love culture here.,"ok, opinion ko lang ito pero it's really bugging me that relationships, crushes, and couples are more important to majority of filipinos rather than accomplishing academic success, having a good career, and being set for life. puro kantutan, kabastusan, at pagrerelasyon ng maaga ang pinagiisipan ng mga tao kaysa gumawa ng paraan para makatapos ng pag-aaral at makakuha ng magandang trabaho o umasenso sa buhay. tapos, minamadali pa nila ang pagliligaw kahit hindi pa ready yung isa. hindi kailangan ng isang relasyon o romantic/sexual relationship para maramdaman mo ang pagmamahal ng iba. worse, yung mga single diyan, pinagtatawanan ng mga nagrerelasyon dahil wala daw jowa. puta, wala kang pera pagbili ng gusto mo dahil pinabigay mo sa crush mo tapos bastos ka pa sa iba dahil wala pa silang gf/bf o gusto na single sila. sana lang, matuto lang nila na huminay at umitindi lang. grabe na, yung mga may jowa na, nagtatagal lang ang relasyon nila sa ilang buwan o linggo bago maghiwalay. kahit may relasyon ka na, hindi pa yan sapat para sabihin mo na ok ka na sa buhay.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/xhbhnz/i_dont_like_the_hugotlove_culture_here/,18 09 2022

angkas app cancels my booking,"i could be wrong. i have two numbers registered in angkas. i often use my smart number. nung lumuwag na uli ang protocols, sobrang tagal na mag booking (20mins +). kinacancel ko na lang and nag te train na lang ako. i cancelled a bunch of booking awaiting rider acceptance. now, everytime i book a ride, automatic na nag pop out na ""no riders near my area"". so mag train na lang which will take me 1.5h to get to work. the problem is, sandamakmak na angkas riders ang nakikita ko sa labas ng building namin waiting for their passengers or just traveling to and fro. didn't mind it at first, pero this happened a lot of times na that i cannot use my angkas app na. tinry ko na rin mag book sa labas ng building namin, literally just looking at the angkas drivers na nag da drop ng customer nila. just the same, no riders in my area. i updated the app, thinking that maybe it will fix the issue pero same thing pa rin. so i decided to use my globe number instead. i rarely use it for angkas thus, no track record of cancelation in between booking. lo and behold... i finally got a ride. tldr: cancelling your bookings might indirectly, block you from angkas by using pop outs na walang rider within the area when in fact, meron pala. cancelling covers those cancelled bookings awaiting rider acceptance. hindi yung cancelled despite being accepted by rider. i don't cancel when i have a ride. i don't have any issue at present. i was just wondering if bug ba to or is this normal sa across ride sharing app. kala ko kasi kina count lang nila yung nag cancel ka if in accept nanni rider.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/zwv363/angkas_app_cancels_my_booking/,28 12 2022

Para sa mga nagvolunteer at umatend ng mga rallies...,"at sa mga nakisama in spirit, thank you for your efforts! on a lighter note, maiba lang tayo, share naman kayo ng heartwarming stories or experiences nyo this campaign period. nakakanerbyos kase yung mga nangyayare lately, let's make this thread full of good vibes and positivity. i want to hear stories of people giving rides, sharing lumpia, cupcake or water, or finding lost wallets. may bago na ba kayong friends? may nagkainlaban ba? yung isang friend ko, sumama sa rally kasama buong pamilya, nahiwalay sa anak at saglitang nawala yung anak. thankfully, nahanap naman. pero hanggang kinabukasan, tinetext siya nung mga nakilala nyang kakampink tinatanong kung nahanap na yung anak niya at maaari silang tumulong kung hindi pa. sobrang ramdam daw niya yung sincerity and yung kagustuhang tumulong. nakakataba ng puso. i've seen a lot of posts about yung hirap iconvince ang mga kamaganak or magulang. i see your frustration, and i guess it gave me a newfound appreciation for my family. they have always had strong political views, to the point where it has put our lives in danger. but they have always stood for what is right. and they fight for what is just. we are martial law victims. there are pains and trauma that transcend time and get passed down to further generations. may mga dinakip nang walang sapat na rason, kahit menor de edad. there was no due process in court. may tinorture, kinulong. may ""napatay"". mga magulang na naglibing ng anak. may dinakip at kinulong kasama ang mga maliliit na anak. mga batang tinutukan ng baril. may mga tumandang may mental health issues kase naka bug yung telepono sa bahay at matagal na under surveillance yung bahay. yung papadalhan ka ng mga litrato ng bahay mo at ng anak mo suot kung ano yung suot niya an hour ago. or yung every now and then may sumusunod sa sasakyan mo. may espesyal na panghampas para bugbog na yung laman mo pero walang pasa. may buntis na pinaghubad at pinaupo ng maraming oras sa bloke ng yelo hanggang makunan. yung bigla na lang papasukin yung bahay mo, raid daw, pero kukunin lang nila ang mga valuables mo at tataniman ka ng incriminating evidence. gang rape, hindi yung pinipilahan, kundi sabay sabay. at marami pang pangyayari na iisipin mo sa pelikula lang nangyayare. we feel strongly about the elections now, because of what we have gone through. so for those who tried enlightening their friends and family, please don't give up. even after the elections. continue to tell your stories, continue to share facts. ipaalam ang tungkol sa mga resibo. who knew decades after the martial law ended, we would be back to fighting another marcos? yes, we didn't tell our stories enough, we didn't teach the others enough. because some thought that what transpired was so inhumane and so unjust that the people couldn't possibly forget the atrocities of the marcoses. and now look where we are. but despite these experiences, friendships were forged. and at a time of darkness and violence, several young teenagers bonded over their political views and love for country. and yes, some fell in love with each other. some of those who survived have paired up and have been married for almost 40 years now, raising children with equally strong political views. these children are now adults, actively participating in political discourse. so, on a lighter note, please share your positive experiences or lessons learned. while we wait for election results, let this thread be full of hope, good vibes, and stories of new friendships formed. and please tell me, may nagkainlaban ba diyan?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ulm5ta/para_sa_mga_nagvolunteer_at_umatend_ng_mga_rallies/,9 05 2022

Should I go back to the Philippines?,"hi, i'm a 26-year-old male and an accounting graduate from a university in quezon city. right after graduation, i reviewed for the board exams with my friend in cpar. she passed the exams, while i didn't even take the boards that year. i really regret that decision, at least to the extent that i can feel that the people around me is somewhat disappointed in me. ""a brilliant individual"" is how people around me often describe me. but somehow that changed after that one decision that i made in 2018. my family started to treat me like someone who couldn't make any rational decisions. but what i really can't forget is what my professor in college told me the last time we met, about 6 months after the october exams. he said: ""alam mo sayang, ka magaling ka pa naman top ka sa klase ko."" at that moment everything sinked in na realize ko lahat lalo na yung mga opportunities na sinayang ko. simula noon pakiramdam ko di nako nakarecover yung motivation ko at unti unti ring nawala yung mga reasons ko na magtake ng cpale. the following year, i tried to do a self-review for the board exam in may but ended up bailing again. my reason at that time was that i needed to review pa kasi gusto ko sa top 10 ako, which is the same reason why i didn't take the exam in october of the previous year, as noong nag preboard ako, that in october of 2018, i was only on top 19. my thinking at that time was that if i gave it some effort, maybe i could enter the top 10. kaya from october 2018 to may 2019, naging october 2019 ng finally nagtake nako ng exam and failed, puro reasons ginawa ko at lagi kong reason di pako nakakareview di ako prepared kaya di ako magtatake, but the more na dinelay ko for more time to review, eh wala namang pagrereview na nangyari, ni hindi ko nabuksan yung libro kahit isang pahina. the truth is ang hirap mag aral magisa lalo na kung yung naging motivation mo lang to finish the course is your friends. so that october, after not reading or solving any accounting-related materials, i took the boards. at that time, bago mag-exam ang yabang ko, pa sabi ko sa sarili ko, what if pumasa ko, how cool will that be after more than a year of not studying? not surprisingly, i failed that october 2019 cpale. i ended up not having a job for 2 years because of my stupid decisions, and after i failed the boards, i was really devastated. mostly because i failed, and that failure was a result of me not giving my best. yung kaya ko naman kaso di ko pinahalagahan yung mga privilege nabinigay sakin, 3 consecutive review centers na fully paid ng parents ko na bihira lang ako pumasok at may allowance and condo pa. ang dami kong sinayang na habang tumatagal na rerealize ko na tama yung prof ko baka nga sayang ako. after 2 years of being depressed, i finally had the courage to go out again and find a job. but at that time, my confidence level was so low that i didn't have the guts to apply for an accounting-related job. i felt at the time that i didn't deserve it, so i applied to a bpo company instead. i did a great job there and was awarded as one of the top employees in my first year. pero di ako masaya pakiramdam ko, i don't belong there, na hindi yun yung para sakin araw araw, i'm questioning myself: ""anong ginagawa mo dito"". the following year, i received the devastating news that my friend had died. my friend's father told me that she died because of an illness that was misdiagnosed, and because covid cases were high during that time, she wasn't able to go to the hospital regularly to be checked. this was hard on me because she's the one i looked up to when i was in college; she's the one who got herself all figured out, the complete opposite of me. she was like my anchor when i was at university. you see, she's very smart, hardworking, and even finished college with a full scholarship. she's also the ""panganay,"" so she has all these hopes that someday she'll be successful and be able to help her family. so being with her somewhat motivated me to study. i'm a very laid-back person, and she always kept me in line, reminding me that i can't get everything in life so easily and that i should work hard to get what i want. so when she died, that brought me to the worst point of my life. it's just so hard to think about all the things she will never be able to do or be. i was thinking up until now that maybe if i found out sooner that she was having medical problems. i could have referred her to my uncle. i have all the resources to help her, but i didn't because i thought she was alright. i could have helped her with the medical bills so that her family wouldn't have to struggle so much. i just can't accept the fact that she died because no hospital will accept her because they thought it was covid. it was a very curable illness; it's just that it happened at the worst time. right after her funeral, i decided that i would do everything she told me that she wanted to do. so i quit my job, booked a plane ticket, and traveled to thailand. that country na gustong gusto nya puntahan ever since, but di nya napuntahan. pero habang nasa thailand ako, i felt really sad; narealize ko na she's the most precious person in my life, and that i do love her. i had all these regrets bugging my mind all throughout my stay there. nasana kung di ko sinayang 4 years ng buhay ko magkasama sana kami now. or at least, man lang, i made the effort to spend more time with her before she died. ang daming what ifs, and that happened because i was so engulfed in my own sorrows that i didn't even bother to check on her; in fact, she was the one always reaching out to me. but everything is too late now. kaya ngayon nagdecide ako na hindi lang yung dream destination niya yung puntahan ko kundi pati narin yung mga bagay na di nya natupad ay tuparin ko para sa kanya especially her dream of us becoming a lawyer. i'm currently traveling and wandering around asia right now as a backpacker and working as an esl instructor for a couple of months in different countries. right now i've decided to finally quit my job and go home and try to fix my life. gusto ko tuparin yung lagi nyang sinasabi na magtake ako ulit ng cpale at this time; gawin ko na yung best ko. and when i pass, i'm planning to go to law school for her to fulfill one of her dreams. i hope this is the right decision now. and maybe someday i can be the person that she has always wanted me to be.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/128v23u/should_i_go_back_to_the_philippines/,1 04 2023
I failed to be a good sister,"i have no one to talk to right now and i think writing here will help me get this out of my chest. so i have a younger sister and she's 15 while i'm 19. she's a 'typical' teenage girl. mahilig siya sa wattpad, tiktok, ig, vlogs, make-ups, shopee, k-dramas to the point na dun lang umiikot yung araw niya. we're total opposite. she follows trends, i don't. i'm good at acads, she's not. what i really dislike is the fact that she's so lazy that she doesn't attend online class because she didn't wake up. every time na may inuutusan siya sa bahay palaging 'wait lang' ang sagot gamit ang mataas na tono na halatang naiinis. she talks back to me and my father too. she doesn't know any household chores. araw-araw lang siya nakahiga sa kwarto at nagcecellphone. maldita pa. sobrang naiirita talaga ako pero never akong nagalit sa kanya. i think that she acts that way because she's still young. next school year, shs na siya pero hindi niya alam anong gusto niya sa buhay. my parents separated last year in a good terms pero nakatira kami parehas kay papa. she hates talking to mom and she'll do everything to avoid it. yesterday, inutusan siya ni papa bumili ng food supplies pero nawala niya yung pera. i was tired because of cooking and attending a class when i learned what happened. i wasn't that mad but i got really mad because when i asked her when did she think she dropped it, she responded using a higher tone. siya pa yung galit and it happens every time na kinakausap ko siya. she's spoiled and i hate it so much. i unintentionally yelled at her ""letse naman *insert name*, bahala ka dyan. ang tanga kasi, hanapin mo yun."" i know i used hurtful words and i felt bad. after couple of minutes, may bumili sa tindahan namin habang naglalaba ako pero di niya pinagbentahan. nagkulong lang siya sa kwarto. hanggang magvideo call si mama and ayaw niya pa rin lumabas kahit tinatawag ko siya so i confronted her. i was mad again so i said ""ano na naman bang kaartehan 'to. ikaw pa galit..."" i was shocked at her answer, sabi niya ""sige, saktan mo ko. di mo alam nasasaktan mo na ko. "" tapos umiyak. my father heard us so he scolded my sister bakit daw sumasagot sakin and such. dahil maldita yung kapatid ko, pumasok siya sa kwarto pero iniwan yung cellphone niya. i felt guilty that she was hurt because i yelled hurtful words at her so after an hour kinausap ko siya and ibabalik ko na rin yung cellphone niya. i'm the kind of person who hates conflict. i'm quiet too and i rarely get mad. i found her crying in a corner. i said sorry and explained that i was tired too. but her answer shocked me more. she said, ""wag niyo na ko pakialamanan."" i wanted to cry too because she's too immature. i was explaining things to her while she was crying but she just said ""di niyo alam nangyayari sakin."" i think that i really failed as her sister because she grew up like that. but i'm tired too. i'm getting tired of her. i'm getting tired of understanding her. right now, i just don't want to talk to her anymore but i'm scared that she's depress or something. the other thing that bugs me is that she's just being dramatic because of what she reads and watches.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/kdkn73/i_failed_to_be_a_good_sister/,15 12 2020
Inaccurate Portrayals of the Provinces,"i've always been bugged by the fact that a lot of movies portray the provinces inaccurately. kalimitan, yung pag portray sa probinsya, mga bahay na walang electric at water connections, mga made of kawayan/nipa yung mga bahay, radyo lang form of entertainment, etc. tapos, minsan ang pagportray pa sa mga probinsyano na pumupunta sa manila, yung oa na parang napunta ibang planeta. guys, especially yung mga taga luzon, di na po ganyan sa probinsya. we also have cities here. of course not on par with metro manila pero di naman kami ganon ka atat ng mall na as if first time palang namin makapasok dun. we have smartphones, malls, internet connection, water, cable/sat tv, electricity, basically kung anong meron sa manila/luzon area, meron na rin dito. oo kahit 7/11 at puregold meron din dito sa amin. hell, may miniso at h&m nga dito eh. kahit nga sa mga interior mismo na probinsya, may mga cellphone/tv naman yung mga tao dun, may kuryente na din, all though yung water connection is a bit of a problem. a bit of a suggestion to filmmakers/playwrights/radio artists/ or any kind of story-telling artists here, i'm not saying that you should abandon your notions of ""probinsya"", because truth be told, compared to manila and to an extent, luzon, the other parts of the philippines are still pretty behind. but we aren't that overly backwards, guys. please just portray us and the places where we live in more accurately. and please, mag effort naman kayo if your movies involve some local dialects like bisaya. madalas ang pangit kasi ng pronounciation tsaka diction, nagiging katawa-tawa pakinggan. sorry if mahaba and if ever i offended some of you. may mga bad experiences lang talaga ako with some manilenyos/ luzon residents looking down on us coming from the vismin areas.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ghts1j/inaccurate_portrayals_of_the_provinces/,11 05 2020
I think I'm losing everything.,"(first time doing this and writing on reddit to express how i feel, so bear with me.) pandemic and recent election period really take a toll in my well being. i was in a 6yr relationship and it is really weird and complicated. we tried to avoid topics such as beliefs and politics. but recently (as i always did naman since 2016 pa), i decided to stand up and fight and be vocal for what i think is morally right. to cut it short, she belongs to a religion which just recently endorsed the corrupt and the thieves. so, we call it quits a while back pa and cut off our communication because i know she would follow their so called 'unity voting'. as of now, i'm trying to be productive and focus on things that really matters. pero still you know, bad news, surveys and mostly disinformation on other social platforms gives us more anxiety and make me lose hope. aside from politics and relationship, my career and family is next on the line. i'm now resigning for my current work to pursue better career opportunity and going back to my parents' home to work remotely. problems are, i cannot focus well and breathe freely around my father alam niyo yon? he's a loyalist and i feel terribly sad he was enslaved by fake news peddlers for years now ever since that boi b/b/m lost in 2016. i sometimes took the blame or like it's my responsibility to help them not consume fake news because i work in it industry and i somehow know how information or mostly disinformation spreads on facebook and youtube. i tried to explain to them about their data and fb ads, cam/bridge analy/tica and all those 2016 election fiasco. i feel like i was fool while telling those things to them. also, the reason i wanna go back home is i wanna be with my mother ever since she worked abroad as ofw, she recently came home for good. so i thought, gusto ko makabawi sa panahon na wala siya and when i needed a mother in my side when i'm really down and longing for a mother's touch. but yea it's hard to go home. i'm also thinking about moving on to different place again and not move back to my parents' since i am living independently rin naman ngayon. but you know, living alone also took a toll on my head for years now. i cannot sleep well at night, i sometimes procrastinate and play games until 2-3am. i had lost my enthusiasm on the things i'm really good at. my 2018-2019 me is better than what i am right now. it affects my career and my skills and just struggling today. so it bugs me a lot on where to go and where to start. so ayon, i feel like i'm losing everything. i'm losing her again and again because of me fighting for democracy. i don't know where to go and i feel like i don't belong in anywhere as of now. i'm losing myself and still trying to figure things out. lahat ng yon, there's this small hope and faith inside me, for our fellow citizen. kahit ang hirap hirap and we feel like we're alone in this battle. internet communities, m04d, all those wholesome/bardagulan kakampinks fb pages and etc. i'm still holding onto hope. next time na magsusulat ako dito hopefully, i'll be writing some good news na. salamat sa pagbasa nito at nakaabot ka pa dito. para sa pilipinas. 🌸",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/uinzvl/i_think_im_losing_everything/,5 05 2022

""we'll avoid large crowds and just visit tourist spots."" that's a fucking paradox, large crowds are practically synonomous with tourist spots. at this point i'm numb to it, if they want to leave then fine, but they shouldn't be surprised if they come back at meron sila nay sakitin sa ulo ug sip-on as well. if they end up with covid-19 then that's just natural selection at work.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/fa8pr2/why_did_those_tourists_still_insist_on_going_to/,27 02 2020

"We lost contact with our mom, who works as an overseas Filipino worker in Riyadh","tl;dr: we have not heard anything from our mom for four days and we are worried about her safety. i reached out to her agency but there’s no update yet about her situation there. hello , i am the oldest son and just wanted to get this off my chest. i am currently a 3rd yr student and masyado akong na-busy last week gawa't midterms namin yon. last tuesday, napansin ko na hindi na tumatawag or nagchachat si mama at nakita ko na hindi siya talaga nag o-online. nagtaka na ko at sinubukan kong siyang i-message pero walang reply. ang last convo namin at last activity niya sa fb niya ay nung saturday pa. nag sabi na ko sa so ko at sabi niya we'll call owwa tom if wala pa rin response si mama that day. kinabuksan, tinawagan ko na ang owwa at binigay naman ang cellphone number ng agency ni mama para matawagan at i-raise ang concern. tinawagan ko pero walang sumasagot so nag iwan lang ako ng message. later that night, nag reply naman at sinabing ipapaabot daw nila sa foreign recruitment agency (fra). kinabukasan (today), nag send na ng message ang agency ni mama sa fra this morning at nag reply naman ang fra na they will check with the employer at babalikan daw ang agency kapag may update na. we were all so worried na to the point na si tita, nataranta na at tinawagan ang agency, baka raw inaway na ni tita ang nakausap niya sa agency at binantaan na ipapa tulfo daw (naiintindihan ko naman si tita kay usually ganon talaga mga kilala kong boomers) sabi ni ate na pinsan ko. now, super grateful ako kay so na nagagawa niya kong pakalmahin kahit napaka overthinker ko. we will pray for mama's safety there in riyadh. if may mga kakilala kayo sa fra o nasa riyadh (near alyasmi ), please baka matulungan niyo ko sa concern namin. i forgot, nung last vc namin ni mama ay nabanggit niya na minsan nahahampas niya na ang cp niya kasi raw naglalag gawa nang mabagal ang internet. hindi naman nananakit ang amo niya, mabait naman daw pero sinasabi niyang kuripot kay tinitipid daw siya sa food. so, i assumed na nasira ang phone ni mama kaya hindi namin siya ma-contact. i tried locating her phone through google's 'find my device' app, but i can't locate her. di naman nag ooff si mama ng gps niya sa phone kasi chinecheck ko yan siya before sa app na yan. ang concern ko lang ay baka ma-depress si mama ng todo kasi palagi siya nag rarant sa amin everyday sa tuwing tumatawag siya na nababagot na daw siya doon kasi wala siyang makausap. palagi niya kaming tinatawagan para hindi siya ma-bored doon, kahit na choppy siya. i will be celebrating my bday this month and my only wish is for her to be safe palagi sa saudi. debut ko na this yr at gusto ko sana kasama ko buong family ko mag celebrate pero nasa malayo si mama. pero kahit sana maka-vc man lang namin siya. i hope she's okay. i really miss her. take ko na rin tong opportunity to ask if totoo ba na hindi usually nasusunod ang kontrata ng mga ofw (in middle east, particularly, saudi), lalo na sa day off? update: a friend of my cousin's friend contacted my mother's employer and hung up when she uttered my mother's name. update (2): i want to express my heartfelt gratitude po for the overwhelming support and concern many of you shared in response to this post. i'm relieved to update you all na we've heard from my mom na, and she's safe, thank god! it turns out her employer's internet service was temporarily disconnected, and they estimate it could take up to 2 weeks to resolve. ito po yung reason bakit hindi siya nakapag-contact sa amin. wala po siyang sim card ng saudi and she doesn't have mobile data. di rin po siya basta pina-connect ng amo niya sa data nila. luckily, maybe after ma-raise ang concerns sa iba't-ibang agencies particularly sa fra ng mom ko na ilang beses tinawagan yung employer, her employer finally allowed her brief access to their data po, allowing her to contact us and provide reassurance. it was a very tough time for our entire family. i can't imagine if anything bad happens sa mom ko. thank you all for your support and kind words. it means the world to us, and we're now in a much better state knowing my mom is okay. appreciate you all po! lahat ng comments niyo binasa ko at sobrang laking tulong ng mga suggestions ninyo, and most importantly, ng mga prayers ninyong lahat 🙏 lesson learned: ngayon ko na-realize na ibang-iba talaga ang culture sa saudi. reality hits hard. di ko inexpect na pati sa mobile data ay kayang ipagdamot ng employer ng mama ko. tho i still believe na hindi naman lahat ng stereotype patungkol sa mga arabs ay totoo and cultural diversity plays a role in this. despite our struggles, i'm still very much grateful that my mom is safe and sound.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/18cr8a4/we_lost_contact_with_our_mom_who_works_as_an/,7 12 2023
Some jeepney drivers don’t deserve their license.,"meron talagang mga jeepney drivers na mae-encounter ka na mapapaisip ka nalang, “paano kaya nakakuha ng lisensya to?”. sunod-sunod na traffic violations, mainit ang ulo na idadamay pa yung mga inosenteng pasahero, di nagbibigay ng sukli, etc. i don’t want this post na maging anti-poor. i know all of them just want to make a living and provide for their families but that doesn’t mean naman na they can just be reckless sa road, right? when you’re driving, especially a public vehicle, hindi lang life mo ang at risk, mga pasahero mo rin. last friday i encountered this extremely rude jeepney driver along alabang-zapote road. just to be clear hindi ako yung sinungitan nya but other pasahero pero i feel really bad for them because isipin mo sobrang init na ng panahon and pagod ka from work or school tapos ganyan pa ugali ng jeepney driver na masasakyan mo. like this one guy said “sa tabi lang po” and i’m guessing he assumed that the driver didn’t hear what he said so the pasahero said “para po” ng 2 times pa ulit. the driver got mad and shouted “sa susunod nga na nagmamadali kayo bumili kayo ng sarili nyong sasakyan ha”. nasa tabi ng driver ako nakaupo nun so rinig na rinig ko talaga and i was shookt. then meron pa na may nakasabay sya sa kabilang lane na friend nyang jeepney driver din and nag kwentuhan sila habang nag d-drive ng sobrang bagal it was causing traffic na sa likod, one driver behind him talagang nag b-beep na sa kanila and this caused him to explode again and shouted “putang ina mo kanina ka pa busina nang busina ha”. tapos one person said “para po” pero this time di talaga narinig ng driver kaya napahinto sya sa may bandang intersection and he got pissed again and shouted about how filipinos are pasaway daw and stuff na bakit ngayon lang daw bababa. gosh, the amount of times i rolled my eyes during the byahe talaga. then the driver stopped suddenly and said sa lahat ng pasahero “wala bang bababa dyan?” then no one responded but i noticed this one student slightly leaning forward to get a clear view of the road ahead, obvious naman na bababa sya malapit na. the driver ignored this and exclaimed “wala na bababa dyan ng alanganin ha” sabay harurot ng sobrang bilis, completely ignoring the poor student saying “para po” and di tumigil hanggang di nakarating sa next stop light. after that thing talaga i realized di ko na kaya tagalan yung driver na yun, bumababa nalang ako nung medyo malapit na sa destination ko. when i looked back pa nga i saw na he parked his jeepney na sa side ng road and got off, habang meron pang pasahero sa loob. he just decided that’s the end of his byahe and wala na magagawa yung ibang pasahero but bumaba nalang kahit malayo pa ang destination nila. buong byahe rin bigla bigla syang sumisingit sa ibang lane, nag overflow, di nag si-signal, etc. i was scared for my life. sorry for the long rant. this really just pissed me off. there’s so many things i wish i’ve done like take a picture of his plate number and file a report to ltfrb pero di ko rin nagawa because i was also slightly bothered by the thought na baka magalit sya sa akin if i even dare take a picture of his jeepney.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/17deymr/some_jeepney_drivers_dont_deserve_their_license/,21 10 2023

Why do some foreigners have the audacity to discriminate against Filipinos….IN THE PHILIPPINES?,"this morning i was made fun of by a russian foreigner because of my skin color. so this weekend binistia ko ung kapatid ko sa apartment niya sa bgc. she has work on saturdays, so while waiting for her i decided to wait by the pool and open area located at the ground floor. everything was going great until these 2 russian kids together with, who i assume was, their dad arrived. pagdating palang nila sa pool area napansin ko na nakatitig na agad ung tatay sakin eh ako di ko nalang pinansin kasi baka curious lang. after a while, nag swiswimming na ung mga anak niya tas biglang napansin ko na titingin siya sakin tapos titingin sa phone tapos titingin ulit sakin. so parang ako taena ano problema neto. mga ilang minutes lumapit ung lalaki niyang anak tapos tumingin sa cellphone tapos tumingin sakin tapos tumawa?? then may sinabi ung kid na russian tapos parang nag gesture siya sa arms/ skin tapos tumawa silang mag ama. never ko naman kinahiya ung balat ko (medjo dark brown kasi ung skin ko) pero nung pinag tatawanan nila ako parang na conscious ako bigla. grabe, ako pa ung nahiya kahit nasa sarili kong bansa ako. di ko first time bisitahin kapatid ko sa apartment niya so sanay na ako na maraming foreigner dun pero okay lang kasi usually walang pansinan at walang pakailaman ng trip. anyway, after nun nainis ako so umalis na ako dun then later kwinento ko sa kapatid ko tas nag kwento siya na napapansin niya na bastos talaga ung family na yun kasi daw may time na nakita nung kapatid ko na sinisigawan nung kid ung yaya niya na pinoy din then nung sinita nung guard kasi bawal sumigaw sa lobby kinagat daw ung guard. nakaka disappoint din kasi di yun yung first time ma discriminate sa pinas. ung other time, nangyari naman toh nung 2nd year ng college mga 2018, ung block namin nasa bahay ng kaklase namin na chinese kasi may block project. napansin namin na ayaw kami kausapin ng magulang niya so akala namin na baka masungit lang talaga so di namin masyadong binigyan pansin. tapos nung mga gabi na dumating ung iba namin mga kaklase napagkataon na chinese ung mga dumating (may mga shifts kami kasi di kasya lahat ng tao dun sa bahay). tapos biglang ang bait bigla nung nanay niya? tapos pag nag uusap sila chinese lang di kami sinasama sa conversation. so bakit ka naman titira sa pilipinas kung gusto mo lahat ng kaibigan ng anak mo chinese?? okay lang ba sila? nakakarindi lang na ang kapal ng mukha nilang mang exclude and discriminate ng mga pilipino sa sarili nilang bansa.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/15p33op/why_do_some_foreigners_have_the_audacity_to/,12 08 2023

My thanksgiving dinner experience with a BBM family.,"so eto nga guys, nag-punta kami (me (f), my wife (f) my sister and her bf) reluctantly sa invitation ng ilocano-bbm tita na kapit-bahay namin. may pinag-samahan naman yung family kahit papano, before elections super ganda ng communication namin sa kanila kasi kapitbahay namin dito sa canada. saktong usapan lang, nag-dasal kami bago kumain. to be honest, ang ganda nung prayer. as an agnostic, na-appreciate ko naman siya. pero gagi, yung kapatid ko brining-up yung pag-unfriend ko sa tito ko na misogynistic bbm supporter din tapos sabi sakin bigla nung bbm na tita: ""kayo kasi maka-leni kayong lahat diba? dapat di na kayo nagpapa-niwala sa kwento kwento lang. dapat sa totoong news sources lang."" mind you, binigyan ko lang siya nuon ng heads-up na fake yung website source niya (halatang fake kasi no actual sources from credible organizations, news sites, people, also the ones she sent me usually walang https:// (unsecure-doesnt mean all with https:// are legit as well) tapos yung design nung buong site, parang cult na may agila, illuminati sht - web designer and dev ako) tapos kinimkim pala niya yun. di ko nalang tinuloy yung pag-rebut ko kasi yung wife ko natatakot na magalit ako. i was very polite about it kasi mas matanda siya sakin and i was just looking out for her. then na-bring up nanaman ng kapatid ko about yung recently nangyari kay leila de lima. gagi nagulat ako sabi ng panganay niyang babae, ""dapat pinatay na nila yun. tinuluyan na dapat sinaksak."" sabay silang pamilyang tumawa (aside sa bunso na awkward sa situation) i felt chills. paanong nakakapag-dasal ng ganun kaganda tapos without any hesitations, would wish harm on other people just like that. ps. sinabihan din nung bbm tita yung mom ko directly bakit ako nag-cocomment and nag-popost na kumakalaban sa views niya. tas sabi ni bbm tita ""isang post mo nalang eh sasampalin na kita."" sabay tawa. eto din isang kinagalit ko sila yung traditional toxis filipino family. lakas nilang i-body shame yung asawa ko sa harap ko? muntik na talaga nag-liparan ang mga lumpia. anyways, officially cut ties with them na. may bbm supporter akong mga kakilala pero not that extreme (madalas dahil lang kasi ilocano. &nbsp; &nbsp; (edit) just to answer some questions. &nbsp; > quote q1. why was politics bough up nung dinner? i did not want to talk about politics because i knew it was going to be a mess, pero my sister thought our casual arguments sa fb nuon nung tita is civil and casual. she thought wrong. she had no idea the tita was extremely pro-marcos. she tried to change the topic but we decided na umalis bago magka-gulo (because i get really unpleasant pag nasimulan ko nang magalit and isa yun sa puna ng wife ko sakin kaya ayaw ko siya lalo ma-stress) anywho, lesson learned sa kapatid ko lol &nbsp; >quote q2. di bako sumagot or stoop up for what i believe in? i tried. di sa pag-tanggol sa pagkatalo or sa binoto ko, pero sa misinformation na nagbblur sa totoo at hindi. ang sagot sakin ""naniniwala ka kasi sa fake news. dun ka sa totoong balita lang. wag sa kwento kwento sa facebook at tiktok."" can't argue with people who always things they're right. siya nag-banggit na kay leni kami nag-vote last election and my side of the family all nodded (said ""yes. syempre tita."") then she proceeded to complain about the philippines being poor right now and then overcompensating sa pag-puri kay bbm after niya magreklamo. lol also i don't ever want to stoop low para makipag-sampalan at murahan sa harap nung bunso nila (na awkwardly listening to her mom talk about marcos. i guess she's the ""odd"" one in the family.) &nbsp; >quote q3. but they body-shamed your wife? di ka pumatol? as mentioned i can become harsh pag galit ako. my wife doesn't like me when i'm at that point of anger kaya we just looked at each other and signaled na umalis na. although i told them my wife is building strength kasi nag-ddeadlift siya. di nila alam ata kung ano yun. tbh nung tumahimik ako, napansin nung bf ng sister ko and akala daw nila may gagawin ako. i'm honestly surprised i held it in like that. i'm quite proud of myself. charot &nbsp; >quote q4. important ba sila sa inyo? nung bago-bago palang kami sa canada isa yung tita na nagshashare ng food niya samin sa work, nag-lolook out for us and genuinely concerned if we were okay. kaya masakit din na this happened. &nbsp; >quote q5. anong nangyari sa fresh lumpia? binigyan kami ng pa-take home pero wala na gusto kumain. binalik ko yung plate nila kahapon pero di ko na kinausap. iniwan ko nalang sa pinto nila. &nbsp; &nbsp; >quote edit: clarified that not all websites with ""https://"" are legit din.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/y1fwdi/my_thanksgiving_dinner_experience_with_a_bbm/,11 10 2022

Ang hirap ng buhay sa Pilipinas.

angkas app cancels my booking,"i could be wrong. i have two numbers registered in angkas. i often use my smart number. nung lumuwag na uli ang protocols, sobrang tagal na mag booking (20mins +). kinacancel ko na lang and nag te train na lang ako. i cancelled a bunch of booking awaiting rider acceptance. now, everytime i book a ride, automatic na nag pop out na ""no riders near my area"". so mag train na lang which will take me 1.5h to get to work. the problem is, sandamakmak na angkas riders ang nakikita ko sa labas ng building namin waiting for their passengers or just traveling to and fro. didn't mind it at first, pero this happened a lot of times na that i cannot use my angkas app na. tinry ko na rin mag book sa labas ng building namin, literally just looking at the angkas drivers na nag da drop ng customer nila. just the same, no riders in my area. i updated the app, thinking that maybe it will fix the issue pero same thing pa rin. so i decided to use my globe number instead. i rarely use it for angkas thus, no track record of cancelation in between booking. lo and behold... i finally got a ride. tldr: cancelling your bookings might indirectly, block you from angkas by using pop outs na walang rider within the area when in fact, meron pala. cancelling covers those cancelled bookings awaiting rider acceptance. hindi yung cancelled despite being accepted by rider. i don't cancel when i have a ride. i don't have any issue at present. i was just wondering if bug ba to or is this normal sa across ride sharing app. kala ko kasi kina count lang nila yung nag cancel ka if in accept nanni rider.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/zwv363/angkas_app_cancels_my_booking/,28 12 2022

Should I go back to the Philippines?,"hi, i'm a 26-year-old male and an accounting graduate from a university in quezon city. right after graduation, i reviewed for the board exams with my friend in cpar. she passed the exams, while i didn't even take the boards that year. i really regret that decision, at least to the extent that i can feel that the people around me is somewhat disappointed in me. ""a brilliant individual"" is how people around me often describe me. but somehow that changed after that one decision that i made in 2018. my family started to treat me like someone who couldn't make any rational decisions. but what i really can't forget is what my professor in college told me the last time we met, about 6 months after the october exams. he said: ""alam mo sayang, ka magaling ka pa naman top ka sa klase ko."" at that moment everything sinked in na realize ko lahat lalo na yung mga opportunities na sinayang ko. simula noon pakiramdam ko di nako nakarecover yung motivation ko at unti unti ring nawala yung mga reasons ko na magtake ng cpale. the following year, i tried to do a self-review for the board exam in may but ended up bailing again. my reason at that time was that i needed to review pa kasi gusto ko sa top 10 ako, which is the same reason why i didn't take the exam in october of the previous year, as noong nag preboard ako, that in october of 2018, i was only on top 19. my thinking at that time was that if i gave it some effort, maybe i could enter the top 10. kaya from october 2018 to may 2019, naging october 2019 ng finally nagtake nako ng exam and failed, puro reasons ginawa ko at lagi kong reason di pako nakakareview di ako prepared kaya di ako magtatake, but the more na dinelay ko for more time to review, eh wala namang pagrereview na nangyari, ni hindi ko nabuksan yung libro kahit isang pahina. the truth is ang hirap mag aral magisa lalo na kung yung naging motivation mo lang to finish the course is your friends. so that october, after not reading or solving any accounting-related materials, i took the boards. at that time, bago mag-exam ang yabang ko, pa sabi ko sa sarili ko, what if pumasa ko, how cool will that be after more than a year of not studying? not surprisingly, i failed that october 2019 cpale. i ended up not having a job for 2 years because of my stupid decisions, and after i failed the boards, i was really devastated. mostly because i failed, and that failure was a result of me not giving my best. yung kaya ko naman kaso di ko pinahalagahan yung mga privilege nabinigay sakin, 3 consecutive review centers na fully paid ng parents ko na bihira lang ako pumasok at may allowance and condo pa. ang dami kong sinayang na habang tumatagal na rerealize ko na tama yung prof ko baka nga sayang ako. after 2 years of being depressed, i finally had the courage to go out again and find a job. but at that time, my confidence level was so low that i didn't have the guts to apply for an accounting-related job. i felt at the time that i didn't deserve it, so i applied to a bpo company instead. i did a great job there and was awarded as one of the top employees in my first year. pero di ako masaya pakiramdam ko, i don't belong there, na hindi yun yung para sakin araw araw, i'm questioning myself: ""anong ginagawa mo dito"". the following year, i received the devastating news that my friend had died. my friend's father told me that she died because of an illness that was misdiagnosed, and because covid cases were high during that time, she wasn't able to go to the hospital regularly to be checked. this was hard on me because she's the one i looked up to when i was in college; she's the one who got herself all figured out, the complete opposite of me. she was like my anchor when i was at university. you see, she's very smart, hardworking, and even finished college with a full scholarship. she's also the ""panganay,"" so she has all these hopes that someday she'll be successful and be able to help her family. so being with her somewhat motivated me to study. i'm a very laid-back person, and she always kept me in line, reminding me that i can't get everything in life so easily and that i should work hard to get what i want. so when she died, that brought me to the worst point of my life. it's just so hard to think about all the things she will never be able to do or be. i was thinking up until now that maybe if i found out sooner that she was having medical problems. i could have referred her to my uncle. i have all the resources to help her, but i didn't because i thought she was alright. i could have helped her with the medical bills so that her family wouldn't have to struggle so much. i just can't accept the fact that she died because no hospital will accept her because they thought it was covid. it was a very curable illness; it's just that it happened at the worst time. right after her funeral, i decided that i would do everything she told me that she wanted to do. so i quit my job, booked a plane ticket, and traveled to thailand. that country na gustong gusto nya puntahan ever since, but di nya napuntahan. pero habang nasa thailand ako, i felt really sad; narealize ko na she's the most precious person in my life, and that i do love her. i had all these regrets bugging my mind all throughout my stay there. nasana kung di ko sinayang 4 years ng buhay ko magkasama sana kami now. or at least, man lang, i made the effort to spend more time with her before she died. ang daming what ifs, and that happened because i was so engulfed in my own sorrows that i didn't even bother to check on her; in fact, she was the one always reaching out to me. but everything is too late now. kaya ngayon nagdecide ako na hindi lang yung dream destination niya yung puntahan ko kundi pati narin yung mga bagay na di nya natupad ay tuparin ko para sa kanya especially her dream of us becoming a lawyer. i'm currently traveling and wandering around asia right now as a backpacker and working as an esl instructor for a couple of months in different countries. right now i've decided to finally quit my job and go home and try to fix my life. gusto ko tuparin yung lagi nyang sinasabi na magtake ako ulit ng cpale at this time; gawin ko na yung best ko. and when i pass, i'm planning to go to law school for her to fulfill one of her dreams. i hope this is the right decision now. and maybe someday i can be the person that she has always wanted me to be.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/128v23u/should_i_go_back_to_the_philippines/,1 04 2023
I failed to be a good sister,"i have no one to talk to right now and i think writing here will help me get this out of my chest. so i have a younger sister and she's 15 while i'm 19. she's a 'typical' teenage girl. mahilig siya sa wattpad, tiktok, ig, vlogs, make-ups, shopee, k-dramas to the point na dun lang umiikot yung araw niya. we're total opposite. she follows trends, i don't. i'm good at acads, she's not. what i really dislike is the fact that she's so lazy that she doesn't attend online class because she didn't wake up. every time na may inuutusan siya sa bahay palaging 'wait lang' ang sagot gamit ang mataas na tono na halatang naiinis. she talks back to me and my father too. she doesn't know any household chores. araw-araw lang siya nakahiga sa kwarto at nagcecellphone. maldita pa. sobrang naiirita talaga ako pero never akong nagalit sa kanya. i think that she acts that way because she's still young. next school year, shs na siya pero hindi niya alam anong gusto niya sa buhay. my parents separated last year in a good terms pero nakatira kami parehas kay papa. she hates talking to mom and she'll do everything to avoid it. yesterday, inutusan siya ni papa bumili ng food supplies pero nawala niya yung pera. i was tired because of cooking and attending a class when i learned what happened. i wasn't that mad but i got really mad because when i asked her when did she think she dropped it, she responded using a higher tone. siya pa yung galit and it happens every time na kinakausap ko siya. she's spoiled and i hate it so much. i unintentionally yelled at her ""letse naman *insert name*, bahala ka dyan. ang tanga kasi, hanapin mo yun."" i know i used hurtful words and i felt bad. after couple of minutes, may bumili sa tindahan namin habang naglalaba ako pero di niya pinagbentahan. nagkulong lang siya sa kwarto. hanggang magvideo call si mama and ayaw niya pa rin lumabas kahit tinatawag ko siya so i confronted her. i was mad again so i said ""ano na naman bang kaartehan 'to. ikaw pa galit..."" i was shocked at her answer, sabi niya ""sige, saktan mo ko. di mo alam nasasaktan mo na ko. "" tapos umiyak. my father heard us so he scolded my sister bakit daw sumasagot sakin and such. dahil maldita yung kapatid ko, pumasok siya sa kwarto pero iniwan yung cellphone niya. i felt guilty that she was hurt because i yelled hurtful words at her so after an hour kinausap ko siya and ibabalik ko na rin yung cellphone niya. i'm the kind of person who hates conflict. i'm quiet too and i rarely get mad. i found her crying in a corner. i said sorry and explained that i was tired too. but her answer shocked me more. she said, ""wag niyo na ko pakialamanan."" i wanted to cry too because she's too immature. i was explaining things to her while she was crying but she just said ""di niyo alam nangyayari sakin."" i think that i really failed as her sister because she grew up like that. but i'm tired too. i'm getting tired of her. i'm getting tired of understanding her. right now, i just don't want to talk to her anymore but i'm scared that she's depress or something. the other thing that bugs me is that she's just being dramatic because of what she reads and watches.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/kdkn73/i_failed_to_be_a_good_sister/,15 12 2020
Inaccurate Portrayals of the Provinces,"i've always been bugged by the fact that a lot of movies portray the provinces inaccurately. kalimitan, yung pag portray sa probinsya, mga bahay na walang electric at water connections, mga made of kawayan/nipa yung mga bahay, radyo lang form of entertainment, etc. tapos, minsan ang pagportray pa sa mga probinsyano na pumupunta sa manila, yung oa na parang napunta ibang planeta. guys, especially yung mga taga luzon, di na po ganyan sa probinsya. we also have cities here. of course not on par with metro manila pero di naman kami ganon ka atat ng mall na as if first time palang namin makapasok dun. we have smartphones, malls, internet connection, water, cable/sat tv, electricity, basically kung anong meron sa manila/luzon area, meron na rin dito. oo kahit 7/11 at puregold meron din dito sa amin. hell, may miniso at h&m nga dito eh. kahit nga sa mga interior mismo na probinsya, may mga cellphone/tv naman yung mga tao dun, may kuryente na din, all though yung water connection is a bit of a problem. a bit of a suggestion to filmmakers/playwrights/radio artists/ or any kind of story-telling artists here, i'm not saying that you should abandon your notions of ""probinsya"", because truth be told, compared to manila and to an extent, luzon, the other parts of the philippines are still pretty behind. but we aren't that overly backwards, guys. please just portray us and the places where we live in more accurately. and please, mag effort naman kayo if your movies involve some local dialects like bisaya. madalas ang pangit kasi ng pronounciation tsaka diction, nagiging katawa-tawa pakinggan. sorry if mahaba and if ever i offended some of you. may mga bad experiences lang talaga ako with some manilenyos/ luzon residents looking down on us coming from the vismin areas.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ghts1j/inaccurate_portrayals_of_the_provinces/,11 05 2020
I think I'm losing everything.,"(first time doing this and writing on reddit to express how i feel, so bear with me.) pandemic and recent election period really take a toll in my well being. i was in a 6yr relationship and it is really weird and complicated. we tried to avoid topics such as beliefs and politics. but recently (as i always did naman since 2016 pa), i decided to stand up and fight and be vocal for what i think is morally right. to cut it short, she belongs to a religion which just recently endorsed the corrupt and the thieves. so, we call it quits a while back pa and cut off our communication because i know she would follow their so called 'unity voting'. as of now, i'm trying to be productive and focus on things that really matters. pero still you know, bad news, surveys and mostly disinformation on other social platforms gives us more anxiety and make me lose hope. aside from politics and relationship, my career and family is next on the line. i'm now resigning for my current work to pursue better career opportunity and going back to my parents' home to work remotely. problems are, i cannot focus well and breathe freely around my father alam niyo yon? he's a loyalist and i feel terribly sad he was enslaved by fake news peddlers for years now ever since that boi b/b/m lost in 2016. i sometimes took the blame or like it's my responsibility to help them not consume fake news because i work in it industry and i somehow know how information or mostly disinformation spreads on facebook and youtube. i tried to explain to them about their data and fb ads, cam/bridge analy/tica and all those 2016 election fiasco. i feel like i was fool while telling those things to them. also, the reason i wanna go back home is i wanna be with my mother ever since she worked abroad as ofw, she recently came home for good. so i thought, gusto ko makabawi sa panahon na wala siya and when i needed a mother in my side when i'm really down and longing for a mother's touch. but yea it's hard to go home. i'm also thinking about moving on to different place again and not move back to my parents' since i am living independently rin naman ngayon. but you know, living alone also took a toll on my head for years now. i cannot sleep well at night, i sometimes procrastinate and play games until 2-3am. i had lost my enthusiasm on the things i'm really good at. my 2018-2019 me is better than what i am right now. it affects my career and my skills and just struggling today. so it bugs me a lot on where to go and where to start. so ayon, i feel like i'm losing everything. i'm losing her again and again because of me fighting for democracy. i don't know where to go and i feel like i don't belong in anywhere as of now. i'm losing myself and still trying to figure things out. lahat ng yon, there's this small hope and faith inside me, for our fellow citizen. kahit ang hirap hirap and we feel like we're alone in this battle. internet communities, m04d, all those wholesome/bardagulan kakampinks fb pages and etc. i'm still holding onto hope. next time na magsusulat ako dito hopefully, i'll be writing some good news na. salamat sa pagbasa nito at nakaabot ka pa dito. para sa pilipinas. 🌸",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/uinzvl/i_think_im_losing_everything/,5 05 2022
Lazada has this email bug where I receive email notification from another user,"just want to share. ang email ko sa lazada is my <first\_name>.<lastname>@gmail.com. apparently narerecieve ko din yung email ng kapangalan ko. bale sa kanila <first\_name><last\_name>@gmail.com. kung tutuusin breach eto ng privacy kasi nakikita ko yung home address niya at yung purchase history niya. for now, yun lang naman ang effect niya sa akin. hindi naman nagagamit yung card ko, at kadalasan cod ang purchases niya. saka napapansin ko na he's into biking and fitness din. kinda amusing but scary. since i'm a developer myself, and this maybe a problem sa service provider nila for sending email.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ls3m7o/lazada_has_this_email_bug_where_i_receive_email/,25 02 2021
