A close encounter with COVID-19.,"guys, just want to share my personal experience. do not let your guard down even with friends or relatives, especially if you have elderly, children or sickly family members. the short story is that i have three siblings, girls ages 17 (twins) and 12, who have been staying with me for more than a year and a half now because our mom is sumakabilang bahay. their dad died in 2017. i have another brother from the same mother, he is 18 years old recently graduated from senior high. i did not take him in cause of a few reasons. one, i have an ate 30 and another brother who is 22 who are capable of taking him in. i already have three girls with me and it's more than what i can handle already. second, i know he can't be contained meaning lakwatsero so he's a real risk for us especially that i have a baby aged 1 and a half. three, he's annoying. however, recently, naawa ako. i am usually mataray and masungit sa kanya, just to push him away. i am a realy push over and minsan hindi ako makatiis so this is how i cope with it na i pretend to be masama, mataray and masungit so people won't ask me for favors. august, naawa ako sa kanya and he really has no place to say. my brother and sister who were supposed to take him in, both are selfish in their own right, all in all walang kwenta. so i let him stay. he has a bike so sideline niya is delivery so i let him. i also have a bike and i also deliver my selling goods so i know to just disinfect, keep your distance and minimal contact. i let him stay at our house, he's staying at the part of our living room that nobody goes to and is right infront of our other door for entrance. for the rest, yes, he's using our utensils, bathroom, kitchen, etc. this was a big mistake for me. come his birthday, end of august, i bought him some food and a cake and after that he ate and run. i said, if you're leaving this house, you're not coming back. he said yes. i told him good. but then, my fiance, also a big push over, opened the door when my brother knocked. i told him, why did you let him in? he said well nakakaawa. i said my sister should be responsible in finding a place for him, not us and he said just let him stay it's okay with me. so i did. after three days, nawalan ng panlasa. i knew it, he threw his friends a birthday party and probably they were drinking. i said get out of this house and get picked up by the barangay elsewhere. he asked me what he should do, i said i already told you what to do. i told you to stay indoors right? now, i don't care just leave. i have young siblings here, i have a baby, my fiance is very sickly since he was a kid, i have my step mother who has asthma and is very sick, we have a tenant upstairs who has a baby as well. my sister also called and i told her i told you. why did you let him stay here with us when you know we are at risk. she claimed that she did not know that he was staying here. we disinfected the entire house. i threw out his clothes to the garage and everything he had used. we used up all the chlorine and alcohol that we had. even doing that felt pointless. we were already exposed. we used the same utensils, we used the same door handles, the same bathroom, he touched the refrigirator, the dining table and chairs, everything. all i can do was pray. after 8 days, he tested positive for covid. he currently remains asymptomatic aside for the loss of senses such as taste and smell. we did not get any tests done because none of us experienced any symptoms. it's been more than 15 days since. we are all fine. but the entire time, i was really... mad. for his birthday, he put other people at risk, his own family. i threw him a small birthday party and it was not enough for him. i said, he could have lived with me until the end of the pandemic and i would not mind. he could have ate and slept here for free but he chose to have a good time with his friends in exchange for our health and safety. guys, don't let anyone into your home. do not feel safe, not even with your own family. this was a close call. i will never put my family at risk again just because i feel like i am selfish by not letting someone in. it's been 20 days since and we are healthy and fine. even my father, my step mother, my other siblings, my in laws who were exposed because they visited while my brother was still here, our tenants. no one got sick. i would not know what to do if we contracted covid-19. it was an excruciating two weeks for me, not knowing what is going to happen.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/itfju1/a_close_encounter_with_covid19/,15 09 2020

DDS trolls are an indirect cause of covid 19 infections and covid 19 related deaths via misinformation,"as early as january, doctors and healthcare workers advised the government to close all flights from china. dds trolls defended duterte's decision to keep our borders open by posting sentimental copy-pastas defending pogo workers and by accusing healthcare workers of racism healthcare workers advocated for contact tracing and targeted mass testing. dds trolls repeatedly slammed these advocacies and stated that healthcare workers should stick to their jobs; they don't have a right to make demands from the government. look at us now, still no mass testing, contact tracing is lagging, we jump from ecq to gcq to mecq because the government is not doing anything while we are in lockdown. doctors spoke up against the use of rapid antibody test kits, joey concepcion said that doctors are all talk and no action. dds trolls defended joey concepcion and promoted the use of rapid antibody test kits. now we have increased spread of infections because people using these kits often mistakenly believe that they don't have the virus even when they are infectious. today, pgh has just announced that rat kits can only detect 20% of positive cases; the dds trolls once again blamed doctors for this ""late"" announcement now look at those dds trolls! doctors are speaking up against the use of russia's sputnik v vaccine because of the lack of peer reviewed journals and the fact that it has barely even completed the first and second phase of its clinical trial. dds trolls are promoting it as the solution to the crisis those dds trolls have to be silenced and made accountable for the crisis that we are currently in. make them shut up and make them pay up",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ia3kzt/dds_trolls_are_an_indirect_cause_of_covid_19/,15 08 2020

Brain fog from covid,"i'm a fresh grad who just started working my first job at an audit firm here in makati a few weeks ago when suddenly i fell very ill last friday. it was a nasty flu and i suspected it was covid because just prior to friday, all my siblings felt very ill as well. because of this, i had to go on sick leave for a couple of days. i slept a lot, rested a lot, did my best not to stress myself, etc. fast forward to today, i finally was able to get a swab test and it turns out that i really am positive. some of the symptoms have gone away, but what's really been bugging me is that i've felt like i've lost myself, like i found myself feeling very disoriented, unmotivated, lazy and very unfocused. and the thing is, i can't afford to be this way for a long time since my job requires me to think a lot especially since i'm new at the firm and i'm still trying to overcome this learning curve. to those who have tested positive for covid before, have you guys experienced anything like this? if so, how did you cope? and how long did it take for you to recover and feel normal again? any answers would be very much appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/xqd2nr/brain_fog_from_covid/,28 09 2022

Our COVID story,"so kakatapos lang ng 14 day isolation namin and our lgu declared us covid recovered. i just want to share my experience regarding this. around april 19 my lola started developing a cough that progressed into pneumonia. since she hasn't gone outside since the pandemic started it took a week before our doctor recommended we get her swabbed. she tested positive april 24 and was admitted into a hospital april 27. the rest of our family got swabbed april 28 and the results came back positive for my mom and i. our lgu had us admitted into an isolation facility (15 min drive from our barangay) april 29. we stayed there for 14 days and we are currently back home. regarding our covid symptoms timeline, around the same time lola started coughing napapansin ko na ilang araw akong nahihilo at nag-lbm. nagkasore eyes din ako for a few days. day 3 sa isolation facility nawalan ako ng pang-amoy at sumama nadin yung panlasa ko. losing your sense of smell and taste is weird to say the least. as for my case i did not have any trouble breathing nor did i have a clogged nose, wala ka lang talagang maamoy at ang nalalasahan mo lang ay maalat at matamis, no complex flavors. thankfully, this only lasted for about 3-4 days. also developed a rash but thats about it. my mom developed a fever for a day and started coughing but that was quickly treated. for the facility naman i can't really complain. we stayed in a big hall type building na naka divider per cell(?)/room(?). the place was well ventilated and air conditioned. you get food 3 times a day. pwede ka rin magpadala ng extra food or other items outside from your family and friends so thats a plus. shared yung cr pero malinis naman. the facility itself was like a small subdivision, pwede ka magexercise and walk or jog around the place in the morning and in the afternoon. staff were friendly and helpful too. our whole 14 day stay was free from the accommodation to the food and the medicine. dahil most of us there were mild/asymptomatic and everyone was friendly and helpful hindi naging depressing yung atmosphere and that helped us get through the 2 weeks. sadly, my lola didn't make it and she said goodbye may 8. while my mom and i are thankful that we recovered, nakakalungkot din yung uuwi ka knowing na abo na yung isang tao na naging part ng buhay mo since bata ka. please stay safe guys. get vaccinated if you can. while we were lucky that we got through this, marami din ang hindi. if not for yourself think of those around you. the virus is and was always a big deal, i just hope more people realize that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/nb9os1/our_covid_story/,13 05 2021

My two cents on the rising Covid cases here in PH and why we shouldn't be complacent.,"first of all, this not a fear mongering post. pretty sure actual cases never really significantly decreased these past months to last year. it's just that most cases weren't recorded for they're either asymptomatic or with just very mild symptoms not needing to get tested simply because of the vaccines working and the common variants are getting weaker. but we shouldn't ignore the recent increasing cases here in ph. there's a reason why the number of recorded cases is increasing again and it's because more people are getting tested. why are these people getting tested? coz their symptoms are more likely beyond just mild. kapag simpleng sipon naman hindi ka na magpapatest diba? again, i'm not trying to scare anyone. i'm not forcing anyone to mask up. i myself don't wear mask everytime anymore. let us not panic, but at the same time don't be complacent. (honestly not sure if tama gamit ko ng ""complacent"" hahaha pasok mga grammar nazi) keep an aye out. unless the government is faking the increasing recorded cases? well sana. all i can say now is... ""it's not over anywhere until it's over everywhere."" edit: coz iba iba tayo ng exp w/ covid. i lost my father because of covid. my eldest brother passed away early this year and i’m pretty sure it’s related to covid long term effects. i myself is suffering from heart palpitations months after catching the virus back in 2021. so you can’t blame me if i’m still keeping an eye out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/139w6qz/my_two_cents_on_the_rising_covid_cases_here_in_ph/,6 05 2023

Duterte's COVID response,"i called out a duterte supporter for posting some misleading figures. in the comment section another dds called me out when i said that duterte bungled his handling of covid. my planned response is below. please go through it and give me some feedback and additional info if you have some. i'm trying to avoid hearsay and unproven statements by other politicians though so please be aware of that. thanks! no prompt response by the government at the very beginning \- december palang may namamatay na sa china. kaibigan niya si xi jing ping. one of the few times na makakatulong ang pagtalikod niya sa pangako niya na magiging matatag siya against china, pero wala. middle of march bago niya sineryoso. before that sinasabi niya wala lang yan. sasampalin nga niya lang raw noong feb 2020 e. first case natin january. walang travel ban (except wuhan and eventually chinese countries in feb), testing, or lockdowns. ayaw pa ng doh mag isolate and contact tracing (which i’ll mention again later) noong simula, despite being told to do so by who. live address \- i was excited noong first time inannounce na he’ll be speaking to the people on his response on covid. around march 15 to. i wasn’t a fan of his na, especially after how he softened against china, but i was willing to give him a chance kahit papano. cause nakikita ko naman na may iba ring rabidly against him na naloloko na rin sila ng fake news at times. pero wala. ang rami niyang sinabi, nothing connected sa actual plan ng government. pagkatapos na saka inexplain ng ibang tao niya. i wanted to give him another chance but after a few more press briefings niya wala. personal na attacks and ramblings lang narinig ko. this was the perfect time to show his leadership skills and take decisive action. but wala. personal attacks left and right. delayed vaccination rollout \- nauna pa guards niya sa vaccination. there were so many delays. and while hearsay ang sinabi ni lacson regarding the delayed pfizer vaccines, ppe prices, and vaccine prices, duque’s response to the to covid has been far from exemplary. pero protected parin ni duterte, even going so far as praising him as a hero. ibang bansa dec 2020 palang nagsimula na. march 2021 nag simula sa atin. part of this is because of the vaccine indemnification law, which was signed too late as vaccine manufacturers were not willing to sell us vaccines until such a law came to fruition. dahil diyan isa tayo na last nakakuha ng vaccines sa area natin. doh messes \- no proper contact tracing happened, especially sa simula when it was crucial. namatay dad ng friend ko due to covid some time around april 2020. during his time in the hospital no one in his family was asked kung sino ang naka contact niya. responsibility yan ng doh, i know. but given who assigned duque and hailed him as a hero, duterte bears some responsibility for this. \- mababa na nga inallot na budget sa doh, roughly p200b+ out of p4t, most of which napunta sa build build build projects niya, 62% of the budget is still untouched. hindi kulang ang pera nila to help people. they are clueless in how to use it. duterte kept saying walang pera pero meron. may ibang priorities lang siya, like construction projects. inconsistent quarantines \- delayed news on quarantines. sobrang dalas na one day before the expected date saka nila iaannounce kung anong quarantine level ang gagawin. one time they announced in advance only to turn it a day before the quarantine. yes it takes planning but they usually have a week to do these things, starting from announcement of the schedule of change of quarantine. \- but of course, the blame game is on the citizens. yes, pasaway ang tao, but nagmamalinis rin ang gov’t as if wala silang power to control its citizens. the close-open attitude to the quarantine didn’t help. \- isa tayo sa mga bansa with the longest quarantines. we still had one of the highest numbers. others \- handling of the dengvaxia controversy (2017-2018) – this was a long time ago but there’s a hesitance to use vaccines because of what happened back then. while duterte remained uncharacteristically quiet during that time, he never really assured the public during t that time the vaccines are okay, that what happened during the dengvaxia incident was an exception. 2019 na siya nagsalita at which point too late. he does go on to say on air in june 2021 that he’ll jail people who refuses the vaccine, a threat with no teeth, but the damage has been done. tumaas rin ang dengue after that. \- he protects his people. one moment duterte lambasts people who hold events the next he ignores the fact that sinas does exactly that, setting a bad example to people. if his personnel doesn’t care to follow, why should we. tapos ngayon undersecretary na siya. \- and despite his supporters loving his way of talking gems such as “soak your masks in gasoline” and accusing doctors of wanting to overthrow the government, happened. \- instead of appointing medical experts in his covid task force, aside from duque, the others are lawyers and ex-generals. that can help with operations but getting knowledge from medical experts to handle a health-related crisis seems to make more sense.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/qxa3r1/dutertes_covid_response/,19 11 2021
Students in the COVID-19 panemic.,"**please read with an open mind and an open heart.** i am a college student currently studying in an institution that boasts an e-learning management system that it claims is effective in managing tasks for students in continued learning. as many people in this country face a big threat to continue their lives while a general public health crisis is in full effect. the ever growing worry that students is various parts of this country is faced with a heightened risk that dep-ed and ched would allow classes to resume at august is just dangerous and e-learning in our context is really limiting what education can really do for the people. me myself did not have the greatest conducive learning environment while at home. while i can access the materials properly and can answer it on my own schedule, the unnecessary tasks led me to have greater anxiety, and depression caused by how much i cared for the persons i love during this pandemic, thinking everyday that what would happened if one day, the virus got to him/her. despite the anxieties, i am forced by my will to continue this non-conducive learning method that really was not that efficient in how i learned. in some jokes with my friends, we even laughed when we said that here our new professor, prof youtube. **unfair to many and to the filipino people** e-learning alternatives is just plain unfair to many students in the philippines that has no access to stable, reliable, and dependable broadband. and just plainly the lack of access to the necessary devices needed to fulfill the tasks provided as such. in many cases, this is the plain reason why parents send their kids to expensive universities and colleges to have an equal advantage of using laboratories and equipment to use at their fullest advantage. but here we are some colleges forcing e-learning saying that they believe they have the capacity to support this learning measure. in my response, no you're not ready. i believe that there is a possibility of using an online learning component of learning but this is just plainly not the right time to do it. lets not forget that many people who are poor will more likely loose access to education given free by the government itself. imagine all those public schools pushing a non effective medium but instead of focusing our resources in combatting this pandemic we have to spend it on that. dep-ed and ched i ask that you study this in the ***bigger picture. not in the eyes of what schools says but what student says. what is education if you cant reach the full potential of learning?*** &#x200b; **mental health** as said before, there is also a high probability that many students do not have the mental capacity to learn effectively while a pandemic is ongoing, a news article by many news agencies tell that mental health concerns are rising amidst the current worldwide pandemic. me myself is a testament to that and has suffered a lot of anxiety and depression during these tragic times. a simple seminar wouldn't fix this, or even a consultation. it's a pandemic, t makes us worry more. the economy is not doing fine, stocks are down, many issues arise in our society and the growing risk every single day is just a great challenge for many filipinos. &#x200b; **is it worth the risk?** schools most likely is a gathering place, whether we follow standard safety and health procedures, its a social place which is in a way dear in my heart. some might say in filipino "" ano ba yan padagdag lang ng padagdag ang taon ng pagaaral"", let me ask you again, ***is it worth the risk?.*** we want our chile to succeed in life and have a better future? , would you risk that and instead of them staying at home comfortably, you want to risk them going to face to face classes. even if it's e-learning, if you're really pushing it, i ask you ""***would a student learn as well as how it was delivered in a face to face environment?""***. it's like the saying that if it works it works, but what about quality? you've been thought online but did you truly understand it? ***is it worth to be a professional if you didn't learn the skills that explores the passion in your profession?*** &#x200b; **schools should support teachers while still in the pandemic.** we love our teachers, we really do. they've been part of our lives and how we've changed but hearing the news that some teachers are having difficulties having make ends meet, its a sad story to hear. we call to our schools and to the government that please don't let them down. teachers, professors and the academe are the wonderful people that taught many generation of people empowering them through passion. our health-workers, they use what they've been thought. we salute our teachers as we also salute our dearest front-line workers. &#x200b; we support what the executive government said that the education sector isn't worth opening until the crises and or a vaccine is develop, it isn't just worth the risk. &#x200b; i just want to share this sentiment to my fellow filipinos. as we strive for better education and a better future, let us act as one and be united. a united people towards a greater philippines. &#x200b; please share your thoughts with this discussion! &#x200b; stay home! stay safe!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/gqwg7k/students_in_the_covid19_panemic/,26 05 2020

In my case I think I got infected at a barber shop.,"i am certain i got covid from a barbershop. i went to get a haircut on the 31st and all the barbershops were closed except for one. there was a barber who was coughing. a lot. he was cutting the hair of an unmasked older gentleman who didnt seem to mind. the barber told me to sit down because he will be done shortly with cutting the hair of the older person then it would be my turn. i should have walked out. normally i avoid people coughing but i thought it didnt matter as this was the 31st - before news of the big surge. i also thought that the barber was coughing due to the cold weather. i didn't walk out. instead i had my haircut by another barber in the same shop. i hope the older guy is okay. :-( i'm fully vaxxed with astrazeneca and boostered with moderna. edit: and i have flu vaxx too. as for me i'm ok - no more colds,- slight cough with sore throat - isolating right now. 02 sats never dropped below 97 although i had a nonstop runny nose for four days. it's the worst i've ever had in my life. can you guys please share how you think you got covid? i think it would help others be more careful.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/rx1xu7/covid_positive_here_could_any_fellow_positives/,6 01 2022

The noise is driving me insane,"i've been travelling in ph for about 2 weeks now. i've been to many places in se asia but ph is by far the loudest place that i ever remember going. every place i've been to is just so extremely noisy. it is impossible to sleep after 6.30am because there will be always someone or something waking you up. i was on palawan for a week. spent a few days on the edge of a small village where i would be woken up around or before 6am by a cacophony of roosters, pigs, dogs, and a hammering neighbor who also loved to play loud music from 6am. sleeping before 1am was impossible because the nearby bar would blast music until at least that time. i hoped to find more peace in the more touristic and developed el nido, indeed there didn't seem to be many animals or hammering neighbors around my hotel, but filipino hotel guests who were talking and laughing (and sometimes screaming) loudly at breakfast at 7am more or less in front of my door. later they were replaced with other filipino guests who didn't speak much but instead played music during breakfast. currently i'm on bohol in a hotel where somebody is hammering the entire evening and morning from 6.30am. luckily they stop hammering for about 7 hours during the night. this morning it woke me up. my room is adiacent to the common area, where some filipino guests seem to be hanging out almost 24/7, talking loudly, making constant phone calls on speaker with their family and coughing as if they have long cancer. in fact, coughing and burping loudly seems to be another hobby of filipinos since the guests at the breakfast in el nido loved doing that as well. the male guest there had to burp loudly about every 20 seconds from 7 to 8 am. if that didn't disturb me enough, my current hotel faces the road where insanely loud motorbikes, buses and tricycles blaze past, constantly honking for god who knows what reason. what am i supposed to do here? and yes, i wear earplugs, even sometimes when i'm not sleeping, but the noise is just driving me absolutely crazy. how filipinos are able to live in their own country, i really don't know. it's good that i have less than a week left here, or i would go permanently insane.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/11f4a03/the_noise_is_driving_me_insane/,1 03 2023

Wtf is with people and their poor health behaviors,"i just want to rant about how one person in the family recklessly caused everyone else in the household to be sick. it all started last week when my dad experienced symptoms. as early as then, my mom would tell him to wear a mask around the house, especially considering that we also have a senior living with us. but he didn’t listen. he would react as if my mom was treating him harshly for being sick and respond with “hindi na nga ako lumalapit masyado sainyo.” he never attempted to wear a mask nor practice precautionary measures. he wouldn’t cover his mouth when coughing or sneezing—even during meals, considering that he sits at the end of the table (kabisera), in front all of us. he is disgusting. now, everyone in the household is sick, including my lola, and i hate it. it is very hard to function when sick. i am currently in my final year of college that’s why i’m busy working on my thesis, alongside my other academics, and reviewing for the nmat. but i cannot work at my highest capacity because my current health condition doesn’t permit me to. the same goes for my brother who’s reviewing for his boards. it is frustrating and infruriating. all of these could have been prevented if my father wasn't only thinking of himself. yesterday he even went out and and ate at a boodle fight. how selfish and stupid, right? i am honestly livid with him. if it were us who got sick first, he definitely would have scolded us. i don't know why also, as you're probably wondering why he would scold us for being sick. that's just how his mind works. he would get annoyed, sometimes even mad, whenever he would hear repeated coughing. that's why i usually hold my cough at home whenever i'm sick. but, lo and behold, he's been receiving all the special treatment now that he's sick. if he wasn't the head of the household, i would treat him the same way he treats us. i would make him feel like it is his fault for being sick. not to mention, my father is one of those people who do not believed in covid. since 2020, we never attempted to get tested for covid despite experiencing symptoms every now and then. he thinks it's just the regular flu. oh, and he also thinks that hospitals are crime syndicates. he's convinced that doctors purposely diagnose patients as covid positive to earn money—that those who believe otherwise have been manipulated. he's also a bbm. lol.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/wzo5wj/wtf_is_with_people_and_their_poor_health_behaviors/,28 08 2022

Our COVID story,"so kakatapos lang ng 14 day isolation namin and our lgu declared us covid recovered. i just want to share my experience regarding this. around april 19 my lola started developing a cough that progressed into pneumonia. since she hasn't gone outside since the pandemic started it took a week before our doctor recommended we get her swabbed. she tested positive april 24 and was admitted into a hospital april 27. the rest of our family got swabbed april 28 and the results came back positive for my mom and i. our lgu had us admitted into an isolation facility (15 min drive from our barangay) april 29. we stayed there for 14 days and we are currently back home. regarding our covid symptoms timeline, around the same time lola started coughing napapansin ko na ilang araw akong nahihilo at nag-lbm. nagkasore eyes din ako for a few days. day 3 sa isolation facility nawalan ako ng pang-amoy at sumama nadin yung panlasa ko. losing your sense of smell and taste is weird to say the least. as for my case i did not have any trouble breathing nor did i have a clogged nose, wala ka lang talagang maamoy at ang nalalasahan mo lang ay maalat at matamis, no complex flavors. thankfully, this only lasted for about 3-4 days. also developed a rash but thats about it. my mom developed a fever for a day and started coughing but that was quickly treated. for the facility naman i can't really complain. we stayed in a big hall type building na naka divider per cell(?)/room(?). the place was well ventilated and air conditioned. you get food 3 times a day. pwede ka rin magpadala ng extra food or other items outside from your family and friends so thats a plus. shared yung cr pero malinis naman. the facility itself was like a small subdivision, pwede ka magexercise and walk or jog around the place in the morning and in the afternoon. staff were friendly and helpful too. our whole 14 day stay was free from the accommodation to the food and the medicine. dahil most of us there were mild/asymptomatic and everyone was friendly and helpful hindi naging depressing yung atmosphere and that helped us get through the 2 weeks. sadly, my lola didn't make it and she said goodbye may 8. while my mom and i are thankful that we recovered, nakakalungkot din yung uuwi ka knowing na abo na yung isang tao na naging part ng buhay mo since bata ka. please stay safe guys. get vaccinated if you can. while we were lucky that we got through this, marami din ang hindi. if not for yourself think of those around you. the virus is and was always a big deal, i just hope more people realize that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/nb9os1/our_covid_story/,13 05 2021

Need help diagnosing sickness!,"hi r/philippines! i am feeling quite sick and doctors haven't been able to provide any help. i am an american who spent about two weeks in the philippines in june/july. i was out in a more rural area for a little less than a week in antique on panay. then i was at borocay for a few days and then manila for a brief time. i ate lots of food i've never seen before including balut, vampire stew, and more. i felt fine the whole trip. two days after returning (almost a month ago now) i become very sick. i had a high fever, a terrible headache, loss of appetite, insomnia, and a swollen throat. it lasted for about 5 days. it was probably the most sick i've ever been. after that i felt completely fine. i tested negative for covid and influenza. 2 or 3 weeks later now, i am sick again but with some different symptoms. i have a slight headache, a swollen throat, i have no appetite and occasionally feel sick at the sight of food (haven't thrown up yet), and i feel incredibly cold. the opposite of a fever, i think my body temperature has actually decreased and i sometimes feel freezing. this has been going on for 6 days now. doctors here do not seem to recognize what this could be. i feel incredibly anxious because i've never felt sick like this. any ideas? i had a great time visiting otherwise. thank you !",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/15n811q/need_help_diagnosing_sickness/,10 08 2023

Just diagnosed with HIV,"hi. i (23m) just got diagnosed with hiv. i will still undergo a confirmatory test on wednesday to see if i really do have the virus. i only took 2 rapid antigen tests and they came back positive, and the test kits are highly accurate. when i took my first antigen test on august 20 and got the result, it was a weird feeling. i have been very sickly for almost a year now, and now that i have my results, i finally know why. i just want to get this off my chest. i have already accepted my diagnosis and i'm glad that receiving my diagnosis wasn't so bad as others. maybe it has not sunken it yet? idk. i hope that i'd really come into terms with this chronic illness. what's really bothersome for me is, i am a person with big, big dreams. i have always been looking forward to the future. right now, i am a graduating student practicing physical therapy. the thing is, when i got my diagnosis, i wasn't afraid of how deadly or how potentially life-threatening it is. instead, i was more afraid of how it can potentially impact my life from now on. i've always had a map, a direction of where i wanted to go in my life, but now, idk what to do anymore. i don't know what kinds of opportunities that were just stripped off from me, and i am yet to find out. i definitely know that life is going to be different from now on, and nothing has prepared me for this. i can't even tell my parents about this. from my family, i just told my sister. luckily, treatment is going to be for free and that's convenient so i don't have to rely on my parents. huge shoutout to loveyourself! they have been amazing in delivering their service. it brings me comfort to just see how passionate the people who are working there. as for me, i'm still yet to see. it's going to be a different life from now on. i know i got this, i just have to continue moving forward update: hello, i've read all of your comments! thank you all so much for your affirming words 🙏🏼 i'm very glad na i sparked this discourse and people are getting educated by it! i feel so much better than yesterday when i posted it, it's just amazing na there are understanding people! i would just like to answer some very common questions from the comments: how did you acquire it? - i engage in very risky sexual behaviors. mostly m2m, and i do it unprotected sometimes. mostly oral lahat, wasn't really into penetrative sex. for 3 years, i've mostly engaged in oral sex lang with people i met online and usually ako yung *insertive* sa role. since then, twice lang ako nakapag anal but puro protected. i'm thinking na maybe i got it through oral sex and take note ah na it's rare to acquire it via oral sex. this is a lesson to all! what were your symptoms? - for almost a year, i was very sickly talaga. september last year, i contracted amoebiasis and i didn't get treated for it until january when i was hospitalized due to sever malnutrition and dehydration. they did try to rule out hiv while i was treated, but since i had a primary diagnosis at that time, they didn't bother testing hiv nalang. over those months, onting ulan lang, i'd get sick na. it was every week na i'd get a fever! again, i did not think na it was because of hiv since i contracted amoebiasis at the time. the reason why i delayed my treatment lang was sobrang hirap kumuha ng med cert from my school. plus, i didn't want to make up for any missed activities or exams and at that time it was hell months sa gawain and all. they had to isolate me for 2 weeks kasi i had diarrhea and it was a symptom of covid (i know, pretty messed up yung clinic namin). i know it's very ironic of me, a medical course student, who chose to be sick than getting treated dahil lang sa school works. fast forward to february this year when i was discharged, it seemed like i never really got better. i was still having stomach problems and my oral thrush came back, even after weeks of taking prescription medications for it. i had enlarged lymph nodes around my neck to which my doctor prescribed me with antibiotics and nag shrink din naman yung lymph nodes ko. since feb ang masasabi ko lang na pinaka complaint ko is just the fatigue. i didn't have the energy that i used to have. and i just notice na i'm weaker. maffeel mo talaga na something is wrong sa body mo. that's the best way to describe it. what made you decide to get tested? - it was a message from the universe. may nakita lang ako na ad sa facebook by self care about free testing kits that they give out and get delivered to your doorstep. i ordered mine ng august 13 and dumating yung kit ng august 20 (you decide the date that's most convenient for you cause you have to sign some paperwork before it gets handed to you). i was curious lang din to know my status. how much will the treatment cost? - free. as long as may philhealth insurance ka, it's gonna be for free. don ako sa loveyourself sa shaw boulevard pumunta. but, some testing procedures are not going to be for free. i will update on this soon since i will be going back to the doctor ng wednesday. but treatment is generally for free",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/162t88p/just_diagnosed_with_hiv/,27 08 2023

My job is requiring me to take a rapid test after one day of absence. Need advice.,"last friday, i was absent on my work because i had a really intense panic attack. i'm a trainee in a call center, and it was my first time taking calls last thursday. the reason for my panic attacks last friday was that i felt really terrified of taking calls that i spent hours crying, and i felt like i would rather just die than take another of those calls. coz i mean, if you're also working/ have worked in a call center you get me when i say that the customers/clients can really be mean and put you down like you're some garbage right? anyway, to add, i have social anxiety, and i am diagnosed with bipolar 2. it really also doesn't help that the calls are not scripted, and you have to really converse with the customer on your own. this is my first job ever, and i didn't expect it to be like that. i'm good at english and all, but the words that i heard affected me too much the next day. idk if it was my bipolar getting triggered, but long story short, i decided to just take a day off for my mental health. i can really be impulsive, and suicidal when i'm in this state, hence why i thought it would be right to take a pause for a day. philippines isn't really great at understanding and handling mental disorders. so, i just thought it would be okay to just tell my trainer that i'll be absent because i have a fever instead of saying “i'm having a severe panic attack.” well now i have a problem because the work is requiring me to provide a medical certificate and fit to work clearance within 24 hours of my absence because i said i have a fever. so, what i did was, i went into nowserving and booked myself an appointment. i got a virtual consultation with a doctor and was able to provide the certificate & clearance. i thought it would all be fine but turns out, virtual consultation, they said, is invalid and that i still need to have a face to face consultation today. that it's a protocol that even if i do get a face-to-face consultation with a doctor today, they are still requiring me to either quarantine myself for 7 days or get a rapid/swab test. i cannot afford either to not work for 7 days or afford to get a rapid/swab test. i need money because therapy is not cheap at all, and i need to support my family. idk what to do. i don't know if i should just beg or just tell the truth about what happened. i'm worried that if i tell the truth, it would impact on me negatively. &#x200b; note: i'm 19, and i was on my 3rd year of college. family and financial problems happened, so i needed to quit college. i don't have a bachelors, so getting a job that pays enough is quite hard. also, no disrespect please. i am just really in need of advice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/yvlxfm/my_job_is_requiring_me_to_take_a_rapid_test_after/,15 11 2022

Does anybody here currently have normal cold / normal flu whilst we are this tough times?,"context: my wife had fever last night, and now it's gone, fortunately. she still has runny nose, cough, body pain (just today). but never did she experience difficulty in breathing. anyways, i just wanna know, if there are people here having the same symptoms but far away from the affected areas. we are from bulacan, btw. we kinda can afford to get ourselves checked sa hospital, fortunately, so we're definitely going tomorrow. but i really wonder, how would a doctor determine if this is a normal cold or normal flu. to add, i'm not seeking medical advice, of course, let's focus on the question. thanks a lot! edit: there are many factors that we can discuss to the doctor tomorrow, like sinipa ng baby ko yung boobs ni wifey, so apparently when that happens to you (a breastfeeding mom), you'll get fever - according to breastfeeding pinays fb group ha? she had sweets din days ago. i had sweets today plus damn grapes, and now i'm having mild sore throat. thanks people!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/fhi35p/does_anybody_here_currently_have_normal_cold/,12 03 2020

Popburri says the Quezon City restaurant has to close its shelter to the homeless after the barangay chairman ordered it to stop operating for allegedly violating quarantine protocols.,"at 6am this morning kagawad julius sevilla announced the permanent shut down of the popburri homeless shelter at 67 k-8 street east kamias qc. this was in response to the decision made by our barangay captain octavio ""bing"" garces on march 27. the reason for this shutdown is the violation of the quarantine protocols enforced by the barangay. for the record, we at popburri learned along the way to enforce the protocols required. yesterday we are proud to have set up stations in the effort to comply with the quarantine protocols, namely mandatory fever check (with two fever guns), mandatory health interview, mandatory bleach and soap foot wash, mandatory shower, mandatory face mask, mandatory bag check for all items, and 1 meter distance in sleeping, eating and lining up. last night 72 homeless clients slept safe and sound under these protocols. unfortunately, these did not meet the requirements. the lord gives us leaders in our nation that see further than we can, and often are more knowledgeable in many aspects and therefore we respectfully honor the decision made by our barangay leaders. today at 4pm, we will be distributing grocery bags with the donations given by all of you wonderful popburri friends, customers, neighbors and nagmamahal na mamamayan. we will also be driving around to locations where the karitons sit within our community to distribute goods until this lockdown ends. thank you for the opportunity for our team- michelle, jethro, e-john, coco, char, lois, john, jay, noy, lowell and camille to witness bayanihan in our community, and god's hands at work to help the most vulnerable. i hope this is only the beginning of the process to get them permanently off the street and hope together we can create an alternative, long lasting solution to our issue of homelessness. -love, the popburri team",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/fqe3a9/popburri_says_the_quezon_city_restaurant_has_to/,28 03 2020

Our football stadiums suck!!,"this post is a reaction to that tiktok video rant about why football isn't as popular here. nakikisabay siya sa world cup fever, i know, but to be honest, it's normal na mainggit, kasi nakakainggit naman talaga. one major reason why football is not that popular is the abhorring lack of proper sports infrastructure. unlike basketball and volleyball na pwedeng gumamit ng multipurpose court anytime, anywhere, football fields and stadiums are very few and far in between. take note, politicians and those working for dpwh and the local engineering offices, alam kong lurkers kayo dito. because, really, our football stadiums suck!! manila, marikina, bocaue, clark, at bacolod lang may matinong stand-alone stadiums. probably the ones in marawi, roxas city, vigan, and puerto princesa as well, but all of them are simply too small. most of the stadiums we have are built alongside school grounds, like the ones in tuguegarao, lingayen, makati, lucena, iloilo, cebu, cagayan de oro, and zamboanga. same case with the new stadiums in san fernando, laoag, and sorsogon city. perdices in dumaguete naman was built at the back of the provincial capitol, the result is wala nang room for expansion. tapos, kung may matinong sports complexes naman, they're mainly built to host the palarong pambansa and they're either built right smack in the middle of fucking nowhere or pinabayaan na lang matapos ang event. this is the case in tubod, siargao, san jose de buenavista, imus, biñan, and ilagan. so in terms of accessibility pa lang, bagsak na. football stadiums are supposed to be accessible to everyone, whether they be local football teams na nagpa practice, people jogging at any time of the day, or other people utilizing them as venues. but we definitely lack proper infrastructure to support homegrown groups, let alone a national football league. we have to clamor the government, both at the national at local level, to invest more in sports, kasi kulang na kulang talaga.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/zd1pg7/our_football_stadiums_suck/,5 12 2022

My Medical Abortion experience in the Philippines,"it's been over a month since i had a successful medical abortion (ma). i live in the philippines and it's illegal here. found a helpful group of women on facebook and they helped me throughout the process. i found out i was pregnant last week of january. dec and jan are such busy months in my line of work that i couldn't even recall if i had my period for both months. i finally took a pregnancy test and two lines appeared almost instantaneously. my boyfriend and i are both financially unstable. we're also far from ready to be parents. and tbh, with how the world is turning out, i find it absurd for anyone to subject another human being to this cruelty we call life/living; so we agreed to have it aborted. luckily, i am a nursing graduate and a bit knowledgeable about the process of how to terminate birth (i am not a nurse anymore). since i am still in my first trimester, i know that i can abort it through oral medication. we searched all corners of the internet for the pills needed. found several websites like women on web, safe2choose, etc, which led me to this certain organization for women's health. a friend also suggested an fb page that also advocates women's health, but they don't reply promptly. my boyfriend and i decided to visit one of the clinics of the said women's health org (a day after we got a positive pt). and as expected, they were only giving post-abortion care assistance. legally, that's the only thing they can offer for help. 🥲 the volunteer from the said org was the one who urged me to get a transvaginal ultrasound (tvs). just so everyone knows, you don't need a doctor's referral to get one. a missed period and a positive pt are enough reasons for you to get a tvs. while waiting for my tvs result, the volunteer who urged me to have my tvs sent me a text referring me to a person who she said can 'help' me with this dilemma. we immediately texted the number. he replied and said he was a doctor and was offering me a surgical procedure. he was really pushy which i find really sketchy. also, i don't want to opt for a surgical procedure. so we parked that option first. a few days passed and that fb group that also advocates women's health replied; i was able to talk to the sweetest nurse over the phone. she wasn't at all judgmental about my decision. unfortunately, she doesn't have a source for the pills, but she referred me to fredli's group of doctors and gave me the assistant's contact number. i did find several rappler articles about fredli while doing the web rounds before the nurse from that fb group even mentioned them to us. we contacted the number she gave us and they replied promptly. we didn't proceed with them because they are way out of our budget and the assistant (and all the written documents that they sent over) sounds really rude. but i am not taking that against them, i know they're just extra careful because it is illegal after all. while all of this was happening, i was also talking to a seller i found on facebook. she invited me to one of their group chats with other sellers and customers. on the group chat, they post proofs and testimonials; customers may also ask questions. you may observe before purchasing. they eventually gained my trust when several customers on the group chat i messaged privately attested to them. they have several packages/sets depending on what trimester you're in. they cater up to 6mos of pregnancy, i believe! i purchased the package recommended to me and paid thru gcash. received the package the next day; it was wrapped in a very discreet manner. i spent a week on the preparation my seller told me to do before proceeding with the procedure. she told me to do heavy exercises, drink pineapple juice and ginger tea (pinakuluang luya) multiple times daily, and several other things i cannot attest to if it did help. i was already on my 7th wk (and 3rd day) when i was fully prepared to undergo the ma procedure. the set i got has 6 misoprostol (cytotec), 4 mifepristone, and 6 methergine. my seller guided me throughout the procedure via chat and gc. the procedure was overall ok except for the part that i needed to hold for several hours to what seems like a very watery poop. the cramps during the procedure were very tolerable for me as well. had a mild fever in the first few hours. on my fifth hour of taking the meds, i was able to push the fetus out along with the placenta (i can send you a photo if you're not that squeamish). hehe! post-abortion was way worse than the procedure itself. i never had dysmenorrhea in my entire womanhood. i have a high tolerance for pain as well, but those cramps post-abortion kept me in bed for several days. the pain was so painful i had to take ibuprofen for it. the bleeding was also intermittent. i was blood/spotting-free after 3-4wks. it has been a month and a week now since i had a successful medical abortion. i just took another pt this morning, and it is now negative. i am also on the first day of my period since i had an abortion. yey! fyi: you should take a pt after 3-4wks of a successful ma, and it should be negative. i never fully realized how compromised we are as women with the current laws we have for women's reproductive health until i got pregnant and needed an abortion. ma is such a simple and safe procedure and yet we are not provided with that choice in our country just because 🤷🏻‍♀️. i hope noone has to go through this same experience, but if ever you're in one, don't hesitate to message me. i am more than willing to help. p.s. happy women's month!!!

Clearing up misconceptions about 2019-nCoV,"yesterday, during the parents' plenary in lpu, i've had the honor of listening to prof. oliver dumaoal's briefing on ncov - and i would like to give him credit for doing an incredible job of explaining to parents and students about the situation of this newfound virus. with that being said, and as a sci-tech editor of my school paper, here's my attempt to explain everything he said in hopes to change everyone's perspective of novel coronavirus. what is this? 2019 novel coronavirus (connoted as ncov) is a virus outbreak that apparently originated from wuhan, china. as the newest addition to the coronavirus family (sars-cov and mers-cov are its ""older"" siblings), it possesses some traits similar to the previous viruses. according to the centers for disease control and prevention, its symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. once infected, these symptoms will appear between 2 to 14 days. but most of the confirmed cases have shown that it takes longer times before these symptoms appear. currently, there is no particular cure for the virus. its symptoms, however, are a different story. according to reports, most people become asymptomatic when they're prescribed with medicine for the symptoms (paracetamol, the most commonly used drug used to treat fever, helps patients with ncov deal with fever and thus become asymptomatic after a few days.) how do you get infected? a person carrying this virus, according to statistics, can infect 2 people on average. numerous risk assessments and other statistics have shown that compared to the number of people infected by measles, you are much less likely to be infected by ncov. an explanation for this would be the transmission of the virus. ncov isn't an airborne virus: it can only be transmitted via body fluids (coughing, sneezing, and transmission of saliva.) simply put, a person cannot be infected easily by the virus, especially by breathing in public places. a person can only be infected if he is in close contact with the virus, if he touches something contaminated by the infected person's sneeze or coughs, or if an infected person sneezes on another person. on note of hygiene however, a person is vulnerable or at risk of being infected if the person does not practice proper hygiene. although the risk of being infected is relatively low, it significantly decreases if a person washes his hands regularly and properly. surgical masks are excellent in preventing airborne diseases, and it helps in decreasing the risk of getting infected; however, this isn't necessary for countries like the philippines, since there are only a few suspected cases of the virus. additionally, the best method of preventing yourself from being infected would be washing your hands thoroughly and regularly. should i get checked? there are few criteria for being checked for the virus. if a person has close contact with an infected person, if the person has contacted an infected person's body fluids, or if you have been to the province of hubei (particularly in the city of wuhan) in the past week or month, then it is best to get checked for the virus. however, if you answered ""no"" to the criteria mentioned, then there is no need to be alarmed. the public outcry for novel coronavirus has been misinterpreted: your risk of getting infected is low, its symptoms can be easily cured, and it is easily preventable. what's more, the ratio of people dying to the virus to the number of confirmed cases of infection is low (as of 31 january 2020, 213 have died while 9826 are confirmed to have the virus, a 1:50 ratio of deaths to confirmed cases.) we can never be too safe with this virus. although the posed threat for the virus is blown out of proportion, there's no harm in washing your hands more often to prevent the virus from spreading. stay safe, wash your hands more often, and be vigilant. sources: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019 https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200131-sitrep-11-ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=de7c0f7_2 https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/risk-assessment-pneumonia-wuhan-china-22-jan-2020.pdf",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ex2ory/clearing_up_misconceptions_about_2019ncov/,1 02 2020

"If there's nothing else you can do to help, be kinder.","this covid epidemic is rearing to be the biggest natural disaster that we have faced since typhoon yolanda. even as early as now the economic and social impact is starting to affect the country, especially the poor and the working class. unfortunately, things are likely to get worse. each one of us will be affected, but not all of us will be affected the same way, and that may be the key to cushioning the blow of the pandemic for the lot of us. pain is inevitable, but suffering can be optional. if you can still remember how the entire nation cooperated to help out after the typhoon yolanda hit, so should it be, if not more so, now. there is no weathering this storm without making sure your neighbors weather it too. we're all in this together. if there's nothing else you can do, let's be kinder to one another. if you have a surplus, share. it does not have to be charity. patronize people's livelihoods. if you have a choice between giving your money to a corporate business and a family store, go for the store. if you need services, you can still avail them as long as you take the necessary precautions to prevent transmission. money circulating the community means food for stomachs, medicine for illnesses. if you can afford to tip, tip graciously. it may not mean much to you, but it could be a life changing choice down the line for somebody else. if you have money to lend, lend. if you have food medicine and supplies to spare, share. if you have talents, what better time to make them shine and what nobler a reason if for another person? if you have nothing but a mouth to speak out of, encourage. assure. if you have nothing but a listening ear, hear people out. be more understanding of other peoples' plight. everybody is going through something one way or another. emotions will likely be at fever pitch due to this. but now more than ever we need to stick together. now is not the time for division, disagreement. there is nothing to be gained from gloating, from bickering. people who are right will not be spared from danger any more than people who are wrong. instead of arguments, we need dialogue. instead of insults, we need information. there will be plenty of time to discuss semantics once the weather has cleared, but for now, the more we are all on the same page about what is going on around us, the better our chances will be. sincerity is the key to understanding. and understanding is the key to cooperation. we will likely never have the same political leanings. the same religion. the same preferences for what we thing is right or just. and that is just the reality. what we have the same of right now is the same danger that is facing not just us but our families, our friends, our community. our nation. we can criticize, but we also need to cooperate. we can disagree, but above all we need to compromise. help each other. be gracious in accepting and magnanimous in offering help. start in your small ways. ask to pay things forward. for if there's anything more infectious than covid-19, it is kindness. it spreads far and wide beyond checkpoints and quarantines, beyond religious, political, and geographical barriers. it is afraid neither of shadows nor the light. it stays with people. it changes people, even if a little, that it goes on to reflect on everybody else exposed to it. there will be no easy way out of what we are facing and we are all called to do our part in our own ways big and small. but if there is nothing else, be kinder. thank you for reading. edit: holy shit this blew up. grammatical mistakes and all. thanks everyone. as the great jackie moon once said, ""everybody love everybody!""",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/fja9z4/if_theres_nothing_else_you_can_do_to_help_be/,15 03 2020

Managing COVID-19 without Hospitalization (Long-ish Post),"this is circulating in my circle, and i'm not sure how legit the advice is. ***anyone care to provide input or refute/support this info?*** this could help some people who are panicking at not knowing how to manage. i tried to fact-check but apart from an agreement that 80% of patients can do without hospital stays, there's nothing here i've really confirmed >good advice from a nurse on twitter if you should get the virus: i know we're all tired of hearing/talking about it, but one thing i haven't really seen going around is advice for what happens if you do get coronavirus (many of us will), we're only seeing advice for how to try to avoid it. so as your friendly neighborhood rn, a wee thread: > >things you should *actually* buy ahead of time (erm, not sure what the obsession with toilet paper is?): kleenex, acetaminophen (tylenol) in 325 mg tablets, ibuprofen (advil) in 200 mg tablets, mucinex, robitussin or dayquil/nyquil, whatever your cough medicine of choice is. > >if you don't have a humidifier, that would also be a good thing to get. (you can also just turn the shower on hot and sit in the bathroom breathing in the steam). also a good time to make a big batch of your favorite soup to freeze and have on hand. if you have a history of asthma and you have a prescription inhaler, make sure the one you have isn't expired and refill it/get a new one if it is. > >you basically just want to prepare as though you know you're going to get a nasty respiratory bug like bronchitis or pneumonia. you just have the foresight to know it's coming. > >for symptom management, use the meds i mentioned. for a fever over 101 f, alternate tylenol and advil so you're taking a dose of one or the other every 3 hours. use both cough suppressants and expectorants (most cough meds have both). drink a ton, hydrate hydrate. rest lots. > >if you're sick, you should not be leaving your house except to go to the doctor, and if you do, wear a mask (regular is fine, you don't need an n95). you do not need to go to the e.r. unless you are having trouble breathing or your fever is very high and unmanaged with meds. > >90% of healthy adult cases thus far have been managed at home with basic rest/hydration/over-the-counter meds. we don't want to clog the ers unless you're actually in distress. the hospital beds will be used for people who apamctively [sic] need oxygen/breathing treatments/iv fluids. > >if you have a pre-existing lung condition (copd, emphysema, lung cancer) or are on immunosuppressants, now is a great time to talk to your pcp or specialist about what they would like you to do if you get sick. they might have plans to get you admitted and bypass the er entirely. > >one major relief to you parents is that kids do very well with coronavirus— they usually bounce back in a few days, no one under 18 has died, and almost no kids have required hospitalization (unless they have a lung disease like cf). just use pediatric dosing of the same meds.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/fjp8rx/managing_covid19_without_hospitalization_longish/,16 03 2020

People you met that you feel had psychopathic tendencies?,"medyo maiba naman, medyo nagkakafatigue na din ako with the election fever. as the title says, nagka-interaction na ba kayo with someone you felt had psychopathic tendencies? this thought actually came to me since i was watching some true crime videos and criminal psychology on youtube (jcs, ewu, etc.), and seeing that the genre is quite famous na din ok netflix, maybe marami na ding nanonood here. anyway, na-notice ko na may mga iniinterview sila sa cases na former classmates ng criminal, and that they already shown signs even then. this suddenly reminded me when i was in 3rd year high school, where we had a transfer student. he looked relatively normal naman; the most notable lang siguro is yung minor speech impediment nya. anyway, since it's already late in our high school lives, medyo established na yung friend groups, and he wasn't the interactive type; borderline weird. since may mga aloof naman talaga, we didn't really mind at all. i talk to him periodically, para hindi siya sobrang distant sa section. now, the obligatory *talk what you did in you summer vacation* thingy is pushed onto us, pero put into drawing. para daw may konting twist. *twist my arm*, i thought. everyone had the generic answers; basketball, swimming, tulog, etc. this guy was also a gamer. *heeeey, nice, at least may common ground na ng konti*. he drew a counter strike-call of duty-generic fps protag for us to see, then explained na he was into this. we didn't know him too well, kaya we brushed it off. i didn't mind, since fps was pretty good and addicting naman for others. we kinda had small talks with gaming things, and the he opened up that he was into guns more. waaaaaay too into guns, as in he was shooting a barrage at me with too much gun info. i frankly cannot keep up, nor care, kaya i just shut up and let it go, thinking nothing of it; wala kasi akong prejudice about hobbies and interests. nothing really came of it anyway. and then he just didn't attend school after a few days. as in nothing. i never heard anything about him up to this day, nakalimutan ko nga din yung name nya eh, since i never took notice of anything at the time. pero on retrospect, watching these on youtube, napa-isip ako: is that a sign of a psychopathic tendency? or am i just watching too much of these things? then i proceed to watch some more. share your stories for a change of pace!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/u6bytt/people_you_met_that_you_feel_had_psychopathic/,18 04 2022

Our COVID story,"so kakatapos lang ng 14 day isolation namin and our lgu declared us covid recovered. i just want to share my experience regarding this. around april 19 my lola started developing a cough that progressed into pneumonia. since she hasn't gone outside since the pandemic started it took a week before our doctor recommended we get her swabbed. she tested positive april 24 and was admitted into a hospital april 27. the rest of our family got swabbed april 28 and the results came back positive for my mom and i. our lgu had us admitted into an isolation facility (15 min drive from our barangay) april 29. we stayed there for 14 days and we are currently back home. regarding our covid symptoms timeline, around the same time lola started coughing napapansin ko na ilang araw akong nahihilo at nag-lbm. nagkasore eyes din ako for a few days. day 3 sa isolation facility nawalan ako ng pang-amoy at sumama nadin yung panlasa ko. losing your sense of smell and taste is weird to say the least. as for my case i did not have any trouble breathing nor did i have a clogged nose, wala ka lang talagang maamoy at ang nalalasahan mo lang ay maalat at matamis, no complex flavors. thankfully, this only lasted for about 3-4 days. also developed a rash but thats about it. my mom developed a fever for a day and started coughing but that was quickly treated. for the facility naman i can't really complain. we stayed in a big hall type building na naka divider per cell(?)/room(?). the place was well ventilated and air conditioned. you get food 3 times a day. pwede ka rin magpadala ng extra food or other items outside from your family and friends so thats a plus. shared yung cr pero malinis naman. the facility itself was like a small subdivision, pwede ka magexercise and walk or jog around the place in the morning and in the afternoon. staff were friendly and helpful too. our whole 14 day stay was free from the accommodation to the food and the medicine. dahil most of us there were mild/asymptomatic and everyone was friendly and helpful hindi naging depressing yung atmosphere and that helped us get through the 2 weeks. sadly, my lola didn't make it and she said goodbye may 8. while my mom and i are thankful that we recovered, nakakalungkot din yung uuwi ka knowing na abo na yung isang tao na naging part ng buhay mo since bata ka. please stay safe guys. get vaccinated if you can. while we were lucky that we got through this, marami din ang hindi. if not for yourself think of those around you. the virus is and was always a big deal, i just hope more people realize that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/nb9os1/our_covid_story/,13 05 2021
On Pork Imports and the Threat to Hog Industry,"yesterday, president duterte signed [executive order no. 128](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1416103/duterte-temporarily-cuts-tariff-rate-for-imported-pork-products). this temporarily lowers the in-quota tariff from 30 % down to a staggering 5 %. the above quota meanwhile is lowered from 40 % to 15 %. for the uninformed, in-quota tariffs simply means an imposed tax or duties within the prescribed minimum access volume (mav) or import quota; any import beyond that is subject to above quota/out-quota tariffs. at first glance, it seems sensible to allow more pork imports to resolve an undersupply of pork. that is, if you believe that it's totally an issue of supply. note that even the department of agriculture in early [january](https://news.abs-cbn.com/business/01/08/21/da-ensures-pork-supply-from-visayas-mindanao-as-prices-surge-in-luzon) and [february](https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1130877) did not believe that the spike in pork prices was an issue of supply. now, the [cheapest farmgate price](https://www.rappler.com/business/department-agriculture-yet-show-proof-pork-price-manipulation) is at p180 per kilo in general santos city. provinces near metro manila is around p200 to p220 per kilo. thus, for the samahang industriya ng agrikultura, a retail price between p330 - p380 per kilo is only acceptable. can we blame our local hog producers for the african swine fever (asf) and restricted transportation? the real score: the problem with pork is a [problem of distribution](https://mb.com.ph/2020/09/14/import-bans-to-hike-meat-prices-by-christmas/). the shortage in luzon was a result of it being the hardest hit in the region of asf, while there really is a surplus in visayas and mindanao. in line with the problem of distribution, farmers called for gov't to compensate asf-hit pork producers and subsidize the transportation of pork. another proposed resolution was to ask malacanang to declare a public emergency, to allow the da to realign funds to address asf infestation, in the form of fund assistance. let's compare that to the imported pork. did you know that the [data](https://www.philstar.com/business/2021/03/26/2086964/higher-tariff-pork-imports-put-hold) from the bureau of customs (boc) shows that the declared price or landed meat of swine averaged at p81 per kilo from january 2020 to january 2021? how much do importers sell it for retail? p350 to p450 (between january and february when local pork registered spikes)! just imagine their profit margin! who profits besides pork importers? well, their international partners. other countries wanting to open the philippine economy and flood them with imports. here's what an american senior trade editor [wrote](https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/15653-philippines-opens-up-to-more-pork-imports): ""the philippines, already a big importer of u.s. pork, is lowering its tariffs to allow for more foreign supplies as the country continues to battle african swine fever, according to an announcement made wednesday by the national pork producers council. \[...\] the expanded market access is expected to generate significantly more u.s. pork exports to the country."" anyone with a sense of history knows that our history is a history of free trade. so why did the department of agriculture retracted? profit, profit, profit, people. and kickbacks! from confidence in supply to recommending a 650 % increase in minimum access volume. jess cham, president of meat importers and traders association, and their group even pegs the meat supply deficit at [six million metric tons](https://www.cnnphilippines.com/business/2021/2/8/pork-supple-tighten-price-freeze-.html). [senator lacson](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1407308/lacson-bares-p6b-tongpats-scheme-in-pork-importation) actually already raised concerns over an alleged money-making scheme in the importation of meat. an 'insider' information estimate revealed by lacson said that a syndicate within the da collecting p5-p7 a kilo from imported meat may earn 'tongpats' amounting to p6 billion a year. lacson's number, however, was capped at 400,000 metric tons, while duterte's a little over a week ago pushed it to 404, 210 as recommended by da. if true, kickbacks would exceed beyond the 6 billion estimate of lacson. do note, however, that mav or import quota doesn't mean quantitative restriction, 15 % out-quota tariff itself is too low to import more and more. in line with this, da already allotted p45m for freezers or chillers to be distributed in metro manila in wet markets for the imported pork. but what's p45m compared to billions of kickbacks? with that [hog raisers warned](https://news.abs-cbn.com/business/03/28/21/hog-raisers-to-stop-operations-if-govt-cuts-pork-tariff-industry-group) that they will be forced to stop their operations, for the effect alone of 350,000 metric tons is equivalent to 8,000,000 heads of hog that would flood the market. such numbers would render local hog raisers incapable of competing especially with the threat of african swine flu. the government, thus, having lowered import tariffs effectively served them their death sentence. this country already failed to industrialize and now they want to kill industries that provide for food security. this is a country that when local products dwindle, they liberalize without support for recovery, expecting local industries to compete and magically become efficient. do you even think that with the recent rice tarrification law, rice production will recover even up to producing surplus? sa totoo lang, import if needed. but that has long been abused by the government, technocrats and foreigners that enter the market. we need efficient monitoring. kaso lang ang karamihan sa atin nakatuon lang sa presyo. sobrang tuwa natin kung mababa ang presyo dahil sa mga import, kahit pa at the expense of our agriculture and other local industries. magtataka pa ba tayo kung bakit wala na nagbabalak na pumasok sa agrikultura? napakasuperficial ng efforts ng pamahalaan na manghikayat ng kabataan na pumasok sa agrikultura eh pinapatay naman nila ang industriya. god forbid na kapag nagkagiyera, without food security even the capability to make bullets on our own, this land will fall to its knees. kawawang pilipinas. masyadong marami na ang baboy sa pamahalaan.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/mmj5vw/on_pork_imports_and_the_threat_to_hog_industry/,8 04 2021

Need help! Covid-19 Patient in PGH,"peeps, need your help. anyone here from pgh? tldr at the end. i just wanted to check, a relative was diagnosed as a covid-19 positive patient. as a precautionary measure, upon knowing the result we had the patient rushed to the hospital. currently, he is in pgh and is an ""blue"" color coded area. my questions are: 1. what is a blue coded area? does the color blue refer to the severity of one's case or just a simple color coding for ease of reference. from what i understood, the blue area is a ward wherein 10 patients are kept together. the patient is of senior age and has chronic disease. patient has no fever. vomits phlegm frequently (sorry tmi) he does not have the appetite to eat. patient can breathe by himself, though oxygen saturation is at 70s. oxygen is provided to him. burning sensation at the throat area (we think this is due from vomiting). 2. what are the chances for a covid-19 patient in pgh to be assigned a private room? is this possible? we wanted private room at least there will be less exposure to other patients. 3. how can we get updates about the patient? what pgh has told us is that someone from their end will call and update us. this makes us anxious. like how often are we going to get updates? daily? weekly? case to case? another option is to have someone wait within the confines of the hospital and personally ask the nurses station for update (which i think negates the principle of distancing yourself in covid hotspot areas). will it help if we know someone who works at pgh?! so far, we have no contacts yet but we're still asking around. if anyone knows or can help us on this regard, we will be forever indebted to you. thank you reddit fam and if it's not asking too much, a prayer, a thought for all the covid patients and caregivers' safety. please stay at home, kung lalabas make sure to take all precautionary measures habang asa labas at paguwi ng bahay. maigi ng labis ang pagiingat kesa sa kulang. tl;dr: a senior patient is rushed in pgh due to covid. wanted to know: 1) can a patient get a private bedroom? currently, he is in a ward with 10 patients. 2) how can we get frequent updates on the patient's status. nurse said we can go to pgh everytime we need an update or wait for them to inform us.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/hpynl1/need_help_covid19_patient_in_pgh/,12 07 2020

A Word from the Frontline,"warning: long post ahead due to context. i just got my license last october and opted for a year off. i was tired, i didn’t feel like i was ready for residency, and i definitely had plenty of personal issues that needed sorting out. let it not be said that med school is an ordeal in on itself. the boards were just the icing on the cake; and what a sour tasting icing it was. i digress. when i said “take a year off”, i simply mean that i wanted to stretch out on my own, finally do non med related things ive been keeping off the table for so long, and still keep sharp the skills and knowledge i’ve gained—yes, by working as a licensed physician. after all, a boy’s got to eat. serendipitous as it may seem, a few days after the announcement of the board passers, there was an opening in a public hospital near where i lived. the pay was considerable, the schedule (24 ++ hour duties notwithstanding) was alright and there was a chain of referral present. since it was a specialist hospital i (theoretically) did not need to worry about certain cases. while adulting was hard (literal na parang itatae kayo sa kalsada about the many intricacies of life that med school never bothered to even mention—unless you had a job before med), it was a minor irritation. lesson learned pa din and it definitely won’t do to be charged for tax evasion. the first few months were fun; if more hectic than i assumed it would be. the chain of command was surprisingly supportive unlike what was experienced by some of us during clerkship and/or internship. while i did my best, i still made a few mistakes—unsurprising as this was the first real time i’d be managing things on my own. not once was i lambasted nor abused, and for that i was grateful. constructive criticism and proper advise is so much better than the petty powertripping that seems so rampant in medicine—training or otherwise. skills remained sharp, i got to know great new people and explored my horizons both professional and personal in ways i don’t think residency would ever let me. call me pretentious, but maybe for some, it really is better to learn how to fly first before you walk. also, it really is something else to finally be earning for yourself and be able to give a bit in return to those who have supported you the whole time. all good things must come to an end; or as ned stark more fittingly put, “winter is coming.” come late december, everyone seemed to be happy, still so full of christmas cheer when there came news that in china, never-before-seen pathogen has begun infecting people. it didn’t seem like a big deal at the time, but it helped to keep tabs. soon enough, the virus we now call sars cov 2 which causes covid 19 was on the news everyday. soon, there were clamors to suspend flights to and from china and other affected areas. temporary naman, just until the crisis abates. i’m pretty sure a lot of you have seen the news on that last january-early feb. and then it started. at first, they were either foreign nationals here for a vacation or for whatever other purpose or ofws, having come from a high risk country with fever, cough and/or colds. fever, cough and/or colds. as simple as they may sound, the sheer number of pathogenic entities that can cause any or all of these is simply mind-boggling. this is where history-taking and physical examination comes in. it was often said that 95% of the time, a doctor can get it right simply through those. lies kill, and we would learn how true those words are in due time. going back, the lab exams, radiologic imaging etc are there not to diagnose for us, but to act as supporting evidence. they serve to identify what the pathogen is (for us to give specific treatment if need be), to see if the patient is getting better (hence repeat testing for a lot of illnesses), and to see if there is anything new needs to be addressed. that’s the remaining 5%. so yeah, it was a trickle at first. manageable. or so it seemed. that trickle soon turned into a stream; regular hospital protocol simply wouldn’t do anymore so the admin made drastic changes. effectively, the hospital i worked in became a specialty center for covid 19 with those changes. our job? the vanguard. the frontline. before anyone thinks it’s unfair and too risky, our seniors had the far riskier job of actually handling the day-to-day issues of inpatients including those who have turned out positive. we adjusted. we made our pleas for compensation heard, and at the very least we were given what was due. hopefully, that fairness stays that way for the duration. having done my internship in the biggest public hospital myself, the eventual frontline seemed a familiar sight. the major difference was the fear. fear spreads faster and goes deeper than any other plague can. it started with that report about the first locally transmitted case of covid 19. suddenly the people came non-stop, some outright demanding to be tested despite being told and being shown the guidelines that we follow. to placate such people is a balancing act in being professional and in keeping one’s temper down. it is immensely tiring for mind, body and spirit to do so on a repeated basis. as of right now, the most at risk seem to still be the old and/or those with debilitating chronic illnesses. they are the ones who should be tested and admitted if need be. there are no guidelines for vip testing. god forbid the day there would be. we had to swallow the bile, seeing the pompous and entitled put themselves first before the people they had sworn to serve. heck, ‘til now, none of the medical staff in the hospital have ever been swabbed. the reality that we and the other staff members were but lowly ants that can only serve and not be heard (at least not out loud) was not missed. even our seniors who had a negative opinion on the matter had no choice. rizal once stated it so graciously in the character of kabesang tales and the friars who deigned on his rights and what he knew was just. “siya ang palayok, kawali ang korporasyon.” go figure. that stream soon turned into a river; more changes were wrought in our line of work. more struggles. more. more. more. our seniors had to pull off alternating shifts; that is to say they go on 24++ hour duties every other day, supposedly to keep their immunities up. it does little to lessen the risk of their contracting the virus which by that point had caused all of luzon to be locked down by the increasingly erratic president. most of us juniors couldn’t risk going home. our parents were and continue to be at risk. they are getting on with years and if they were to get sick, then science—objective and simultaneously emotionless—dictated that they were most likely to suffer severe manifestations. the communities where we come home too will also suffer thanks to the draconian measures we are all forced to live with. at the very least, the hospital admin gave us lodging and food, and we are grateful for the good samaritans who have and continue to help out in what ways they can. i cannot say the same for other healthcare workers from other institutions. each day brings more patients, and each day the atmosphere becomes more rife with fear or so it seems. the number of cases is rising daily. the risk of contracting the disease (or any such similar ones) is a constant companion especially for we who actually have to handle patients. the risk is probably similar too for any such patient who decides to get checked in our now-densely packed institutions by simple proximity. remember; droplet transmission has an effective radius of 6 feet. one cough. one sneeze. a lot of people. that’s all it would take. outside the hospital, the news still leaves a lot to the imagination, but what is shown seems to reflect a similar condition. it’s morbidly interesting how a virus is all it would take to lay bare the many, many faults and inadequacies of the system we follow and are forced to endure. rather than lead with a sense of gravity and purpose, we get sad excuses, senseless statements (e.g. “the kit”) and many such other examples. instead of a medical solution, we get a militaristic one. hell, a lot of these soldiers probably don’t have adequate training (if at all) for an epidemic. the masks most of them wear are about as useful as tissue paper against sars cov 2. one can hardly blame them for that kind of ignorance at least. it is the possibility of abuse of power that keeps heads turning and fingers crossed. such abuse has happened before after all, lest we forget. what is incredible is that some people have the gall to defend these measures without being offered enough aid nor explanation. instead “ano bakit? may naiambag ka ba? sumunod ka na lang kasi <expletive>” has become a de facto reason if you can even call it that. i digress again. the frontline sees us and our fellow healthcare workers exposed in more ways than one. i am lucky that our institution seems to have enough for our staff which number few to begin with. we make do with what limited manpower we have because we don’t have a choice. for the larger institutions (public and private), i’ve seen and heard from friends also on the frontline how they have to improvise simply due to a shortage of stocks that those in power are supposed to provide. manpower too is fast becoming a problem; even old doctors and nurses who shouldn’t pull such long shifts anymore are forced to take the field despite the higher risk they have due to the curse of age. the virus (and the menagerie of other microbes in the workplace) is not the only thing we are exposed to; healthcare workers have to grind too for a living, just like anyone else. work from home is never an option. imagine during the first few days of the lockdown, not a single fig it seemed was given regarding the problem of commuting to and from the workplace or alternatively where they can stay to limit exposure. contrary to what most think, nobody gets rich by working in healthcare alone. most of us don’t have cars too. before the present transpo measures were placed, each institution had to think of ways on how to manage an otherwise crippling problem. sari-sariling diskarte in other words. imagine that. it’s even more harrowing now to know some of these healthcare workers have been thrown out like the lepers of old by paranoid landlords who consider them harbingers of disease. mind you, healthcare workers are among those supposed to have a pass to go to and from their place of work for obvious reasons. we have a hard enough time with what’s going on. misinformation and paranoia only make it more difficult and dangerous for everyone. what more for the common filipino who holds no exemption? i’ve felt helpless whenever a patient has asked me how they’re supposed to go home or to pay for private services. i have no true answer nor remedy for that. compound those with the previously existing problems we have in our healthcare system. most, if not all of us, have families; and the possibility of never seeing them again is always around the corner. as i write this, a total of 10 doctors, most of whom had been in the high risk age group, have perished due to covid 19. it is a reminder of mortality; a reminder that not everyone can be saved. forget that a lot of frontliners are relatively young. we die too. the ones in charge of running the country, flaccid as they are, seem to think that the death of one is a tragedy, the death of a million is a statistic. i do hope i am proven wrong in that regard. the personal toll is no less painful, perhaps even moreso; for patients and those whose lives have been forfeit, most of all. there are dreams now that may never be realized, loves that may never again come alive. there are roads in life closed mayhaps forever; not just for we in the vanguard, but for anyone who holds such hopes. it makes one think of what could have been avoided simply by imposing those would-be travel bans. alas, it appears that we have been in damage control ever since. while we (healthcare workers—no, mr. cayetano, sit down) stand united in trying to stem the torrent, it is unsurprising and most unfortunate that even we are bickering and arguing about what to do next. then again, we’re people too. we have flaws too. i’ve said previously, we die too. there are at least ten names now that can attest to that. we are also afraid. but we can’t choose to show that. we want answers from above, same as everyone. when we make ourselves heard, there are consequences that follow. many such answers given too are not all assuring and leaves many a question to boil in a fevered mind. forgive the comparison, but some of us do feel like soldiers being made to go to war without arms. we can only hope that everyone does their part. is this a war we can win? certainly. but we can’t win it alone",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/fs8rql/a_word_from_the_frontline/,31 03 2020
COVID-19 experience and how the LGU handled it.,"3 weeks ago my parents were positive for covid-19. the reason why? my mom went to our relatives across town to take care of my lola who asked for her to stay the night. my mom said my tita there was coughing and had fever, she asked for her to get tested. the next day my mom went home, cooked for us and basically had direct contact with the whole fam. before going to bed my parents received a call that my tita was positive for the antigen test. we asked the lgu to mass test everyone in that household but they refused and only swabbed my tita because she only had the symptoms. it also took 5 days before they got the result. i isolated my mom for that 5 days hoping my tita was negative but sadly she wasn’t. on that same day we found out she was positive we asked a private laboratory approved by the doh to swab us at home and also my relatives who were living with my tita. turns out 7/10 of my relatives living with my tita were positive including my pregnant cousin, my lola, my tita with autism and my 4 yr old nephew and 2/5 were positive in our home i was so devastated because my mom has asthma and hypertension while my dad has type 2 diabetes. thankfully my mom was asymptomatic and my dad only had mild symptoms. yes they took human grade ivermectin prescribed by a physician and it really helped. i was already drinking vitamins c, zinc and omega-3 ever since pandemic started maybe that’s why i had a strong immune system and didn’t get the virus even though i had direct contact with my parents all throughout the quarantine. i had to check their vitals everyday. i am sharing my experience because the largest cases of transmission is through household transmission and still the gov’t keeps locking us up in our houses. the implementation of lockdowns, faceshields, transportation suspensions, curfews and restrictions in public places pushed the filipino people to remove every protective gears they have once they step inside the comfort of their homes because the outside implementations are too much to handle. not to mention no healthcare worker visited us for the whole quarantine. my parents could basically just walk out, i almost tied my father inside because he keeps setting up appointments and errands during quarantine and if i wasn’t there he would’ve went out. on the 10th day of quarantine the brgy nurse contacted me and asked how we were and said that if we were feeling okay they will assign us as recovered on that same day. i asked the nurse if we will undergo swab test before we were assigned as recovered and they told me “if asymptomatic na po hindi na sila isswab.” i told them my mom was asymptomatic on the very first day of quarantine but still she tested positive. the nurse asked how my mom was swabbed if she was asymptomatic, i told them we hired a private lab to swab us at home since the lgu is not providing it to us. the swab costs 3,200 each for rt-pcr testing. we got swabbed after two weeks of quarantine by the same private laboratory and now all of us are negative. imagine if we didn’t have the money for swab tests, my relatives and parents would have been roaming free spreading covid just because the gov’t refused to swab them as they were asymptomatic. imagine if my parents didn’t have access to human grade ivermectin or vitamins then my parents with comorbidities would’ve faced severe symptoms. am i the only one seeing something wrong with how the gov’t is handling this pandemic? it’s frustrating that you can’t do anything about it, more people are suffering it’s been more than a year and it’s becoming a cycle. if anyone here is from the gov’t please implement mass testing more contact tracing and remove the freaggin face shields my eye glasses won’t fit with it and bikers are getting in accidents because of it, just tell everyone to use medical grade face masks instead. please i don’t want another year taken away from our lives.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/mpd6ot/covid19_experience_and_how_the_lgu_handled_it/,12 04 2021

Nakita ko na ata yung destiny ko. (long read),"i posted here kasi d ako makapagshare sa iba kasi i dont wanna jinx anything lol. this story will sound a bit crazy, but believe me, every bit of it is true. i think eto na ata yung sinasabi nilang destiny. this is a long story, so brace yourselves. (for context, i'm a straight male, so babae yung ""destiny"" in the story hehe) august 2018. nag iinuman kami ng mga kaibigan ko sa labas ng isang convenience store isang gabi. ran out of emperador so pumasok ako para bumili pa. mejo tipsy na rin ako nun, pero pagtingin ko sa mga table sa loob, nakita ko sya. tangina ang ganda. nagtatawanan sila ng mga kaibigan nya. mejo natulala ako sa kanya kay d ko namalayan ako na pala ung magbabayad sa may cashier. nagbayad lang ako saglit, paglingon ko, wala na sila dun. umalis na ata. sabi ko sa sarili ko ""sayang, sino kaya yun?"" tapos bumalik na ako sa pwesto namin. i forgot about her. but then i saw her again. january 2019. bumibili ako ng jeans sa penshoppe, nang pumasok isang grupo ng mga pre med students na naka uniform. nung tumingin ako ulit sa grupo, i couldn't believe it. nandum sya! hmm so pre med student pala sya sa *****. pumunta ako sa fitting room, paglabas ko nawala nanaman siya. umalis na ata. akala ko d na masusundan yun. boy was i wrong. march 2019. i was down with a fever, so nakahiga lang ako, nagffacebook. then, i saw her again. nasa suggested friends. so yun pala pangalan nya. ang ganda. inadd ko kaagad, at inaccept naman nya hehehe. but d ako manyak kaya d ko sya chinat. d naman din sapat yung reasons ko para i chat sya (at creepy kaya yun kung sabihin kong nagkita na kami). so i was just happy na inaccept nya request ko at sa wagas alam ko na pangalan nya. but d pala doon nagtatapos. about a week after, nasa bangko ako, nagbabayad. nung nakita ko yung teller, naisip ko parang magkamukha sila. tapos naisip ko rin na, ""kailan ko kaya sya makikita ulit?"". mukhang nasagot agad yung tanong ko kasi saktong sakto paglabas ko, dumaan sya sa harapan ko. i couldn't fucking believe it! tangina good mood kaagad ako. nung bumalik ako ng school after a few minutes, nakwento ko sa isa kong classmate yung about sa nangyari. pabirong sinaabi nya ""pag magkita pa kayo ulit, destiny na yan"". holy fuck. kahit ako d makapaniwala kasi nung papunta ako sa next class ko, nag stop over ako sa water fountain malapit sa gate. tangina pagtingin ko siya nanaman! wtfff. ba't andito sya sa university na pinapasukan ko kasama mga friends nya? (turns out they were visiting someone i think). i was in so much disbelief. i went to class thinking na, i think i've had enough good luck today. but nope, i saw her again. after the two hour class, kakain muna sana ako ng isaw bago umuwi, nung pagtingin ko, nandun siya sa may isawan. tangina tadhana na talaga to. december 2019. didn't see her again for a while, pero nung pauwi na ako, isang gabi nakasabay ko sya sa jeep. d ko muna napansin at first, pero nung narealize ko, sya pala yung nasa harapan ko. tangina ang ganda parin nya. parang may sign. sabi ko sa sarili ko, ""sigurado ako mauuna naman sya sa pagbaba kasi yung subdivision namin malayo layo na din from city proper, kaunti nalang usually kasabay ko pagdating dun"". tangina nauna pa akong bumaba. papunta pala sya sa xmas party ata yun ng victory malapit sa may airport (saw her pics few days after sa fb). what would be your opinion guys? should i gather the courage na magpakilala sa kanya? should i write a book about this? hahahaha i need your thoughts. thank you!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/fa9f7k/nakita_ko_na_ata_yung_destiny_ko_long_read/,27 02 2020

The special ̶p̶o̶w̶e̶r̶s̶ ̶o̶f̶ ̶ Koko Pimentel,"by his own admission, he was on self-quarantine: “i quarantined myself since march 11, 2020, and already tried to limit my movements.” his wife’s own words: “he had been in quarantine for weeks in a separate bedroom.” (n.b. “for weeks”) let’s be somber and check how the koko pimentel's fare vis-à-vis the following filipinos in similar circumstances: a 60-year-old man in caloocan died last saturday because the injudiciously planned lockdown prevented him from getting transport to his dialysis sessions. his thrice-weekly dialysis was his only chance to live a productive life, but he had lost access to the treatment. in just a week of lockdown, his body had bloated. he died of kidney failure. ~~but for koko and his wife, they had the privilege to forum-shop for hospitals. denied at one hospital, they proceeded to makati medical center.~~ the brothers gerald and mark libiran are both in the health care frontlines. gerald is an aide at the philippine orthopedic center who works 10 hours a day, three times a week. mark, his brother, works at the national children’s hospital where he had just completed four days straight duty. the brothers were on a motorcycle to take the two-hour ride to their santa maria, bulacan home. with no public conveyances, that was their only way to reach home and rest for the next hospital duty. they were flagged down for violating the prohibition on back rides, despite showing work identification cards. “my heart sunk when i learned that the penalty was p5,000. that’s half of my salary for the month,” said gerald. ~~but for the pimentels, the license plates of a senator’s car facilitate ease of entry, plus other support vehicles for bodyguards.~~ the 69-year-old homeless dorothy espejo sleeps on the pavements of malate. she was apprehended by law enforcers, booked at the police station for a mug shot and charged with resistance to authority. but to where could a destitute itinerant have gone home? a home for dorothy is the government’s solution. ~~the arresting police instead told her they needed to set an example. yet for koko, the justice secretary was quick to say, “the doj will temper the rigor of the law with human compassion.”~~ koko said his self-quarantine started march 11, the last day of the senate sessions. we all know the senate became pestilent after a committee hearing resource person had later tested positive. we go by his own account that led to his self-quarantine: march 14 he started having body pains and flu symptoms; he then slept in a room separate from his wife; march 18 he had a 38-degree fever and sore throat. he was correct for following the protocol that as a person under monitoring (he came from a risk area, he manifested the symptoms), self-quarantine was required. let’s be redundant to take his word for it: he tried to limit his movements and slept in a separate bedroom. on march 16, five days after his self-imposed quarantine, he went shopping ~~at the membership club s&r at bonifacio global city. he checked out at counter 13 at 1:59 p.m. he breached his home quarantine protocol. he lied.~~ cctv cameras did not. grocery workers are frontliners, too, for being at the receiving end of viral risk. when koko’s test came out on march 24, s&r bgc had to quarantine those within contagious distance of the ~~self-quarantined-but-lied~~ former senate president. the homeless dorothy espejo is in jail but not koko ~~who did not use his kokote~~. dr. israel bactol and others who succumbed but got their positive test results only after they had died is not pardonable ~~when the marcos family got theirs in only a day~~. in a pandemic of chasm between the rich and the poor, the defenseless perish first. ~~koko pimentel and a government with no compulsion to protect its citizens have just prescribed the recipe for mass panic and mass contagion. bong go can go breach the metro manila quarantine again when a fire breaks out in another city like he did in butuan city~~. ~~mediocrities of haughty entitlements and militarism to solve a medical crisis?~~ strikethrough all vip entitlements. &#x200b; written by: **by:** [antonio montalvan ii](https://twitter.com/antoniojmontal2?s=20)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/frzete/the_special_powers_of_koko_pimentel/,30 03 2020
BBM's first 100 days (Long read),"q: how would you grade the first 100 days of pres marcos? a: i would do what i've done with every president. first, i will ask what did he inherit from his predecessor? then i will compare what he has done in his first 100 with his inheritance to what his predecessor did with his in his first 100 days. the first 100 are first steps in a six year journey so they are merely an indicator of where the president will be taking us - up a hill or over a cliff? there will be course corrections (or maybe none) as the journey moves forward or backward as the case may be. that's why i believe the first 100 is a mere indicator of where the president might take us. having said that, let me share what i felt during the first 100 days of previous presidents starting with gma. (i was living abroad during the entire term of cory and the first 2 years of fvr so i can't compare fvr's first 100 to cory's nor erap's first 100 to fvr's.) gma's first 100 made me happy and relieved and her second first 100 in 2004 made me feel the exact opposite. but looking back, i've realized the alternative in 2004 would have been a first 100 for fpj who made movies difficult to watch for even 100 seconds. and after she took her oath in 2004, her successor would have been noli de castro. in short, the alternatives could have been really disastrous. pnoy gave me the same happiness and relief i felt during gma's original first 100 and for the most part that feeling stayed with me for six years. there were a few disappointments here and there, nobody's perfect, but overall he didn't make me feel let down. my optimism remained high all throughout his presidency. duterte's first 100 were unbearable and so were the rest of his remaining 2090 days as president. bloody corpses in depressed areas, embarrassing and cringey appearances on both world and domestic stages, corruption so unbridled that not even a pandemic could slow it down, total destruction of institutions of checks and balance vital for the survival of democracy and the rule of law. and i'm just getting started so let's leave it at that. and now pres bbm. first i'll be honest. i was very disappointed leni lost and fearful bbm would become another duterte. but it is what it is so let's move on and compare his first 100 to duterte's first 100. pres bbm made some good appointments and some awful ones - calida (glad he didn't last 100 days), enrile, bersamin, and sara to name the worst choices for vital positions. and he also neglected a vital appointment. up to now, he has not appointed a health secretary despite his having extended the covid public health emergency until december. he radically departed from duterte on matters most important to duterte: 1) he met with biden to recalibrate our bilateral relations and by so doing tempered duterte's fevered romance with xi jin ping, 2) he shared a well thought out reservation about bringing back the death penalty, and, in the greatest departure of all, 3) announced a drug war policy that would focus on stemming supply i.e. go after big time drug smugglers and dealers instead of the little guys whose corpses duterte loved to use as props for his war on drugs. further he will focus on educating the youth on the dangers of drug abuse and he will undertake the rehabilitation of addicts. (similar to leni's humane approach on drugs) so, barring any course corrections, his war on drugs will definitely be humane and rational compared to his predecessor's which was barbaric and insane. i fully support bbm's position on the death penalty and the war on drugs. there are opportunities he must not let pass in the coming 2090 days, opportunities that will allow history to judge him on his own merits rather than as marcos junior: 1) the assassination of radio commentator lapid must be solved with both the assassins and mastermind(s) brought to justice asap. one does not have to ennumerate what bringing those involved in that murder will do to put meat on his pronouncements regarding his commitment to human rights, press freedom, the rule of law and his abhorrence for violence and criminality. related to this would be strengthening the commission on human rights with legislation and certifying as urgent the enactment of the freedom of information bill. 2) he must appoint the right person to chair the coa. that will correct the bad impression created when he appointed calida, a duterte stooge who raised eyebrows in coa over contracts his family-owned security agency entered into with several govt agencies including congress while he was solgen. pres bbm must appoint a coa chair who will lay to rest any doubts about his stated commitment to clean and honest governance. related to appointing an uncompromising coa chair, the successful prosecution of crooked govt officials will happen only if ombudsman samuel martires is replaced. martires can only be removed through impeachment but he can be persuaded to resign. pres bbm must also certify as urgent those necessary amendments to the bank secrecy law and amendments that will make the anti-money laundering agency more effective. 3) set the example for other branches of gov't, i.e. congress, judiciary, and constitutional bodies by issuing an order mandating that all salns of executive branch employees be posted online. goverment works best when given the right working conditions. as vp leni never tired of reminding us, ""sa gobyernong tapat, aangat tayong lahat."" 🙂 finally, beware of optics in a society that suffers from a huge wealth disparity. pnoy was attacked by his own dilawans when he bought a used porsche with his own money. he ended up having to sell it immediately. one does not have to sleep under a kulambo, eat with his hands in a carenderia, and wear a kamiseta although it will be good to keep in mind that those antics produced a net satisfaction rating of 81% for one president.🤣🤣",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/xwyki7/bbms_first_100_days_long_read/,6 10 2022

Day 1 of Self Quarantine,"for all those who are currentlly working, i advice you to stay healthy, not only because its essential, but because being sick in this dilemna would cause you so much trouble more than you can imagine. &#x200b; (this is just a throwaway account) &#x200b; i work at the back office team at a bpo company. i am one of those who opted to stay at the place where i work before the ecq started so that travel wouldn't be an issue, and i will be able to provide income for my family in the middle of this crisis. &#x200b; &#x200b; this thursday, i felt very cold, so i went to our company's clinic.turns out i'm feverish. when i was asked what might be the cause, i told them i took a bath without sleep as the comfort room is crowded in the morning, and it's almost next to impossible to have a bath, so i thought it would be better if i took a shower after my shift before going to sleep. &#x200b; because of the protocol and the current ecq, i was advised to go home as i need to self quarantine myself for 2 weeks, which i took because there's no quarantine facility where i work, even though i'm only feverish. i was fetched by the company's private vehicle and took me home. now the bad thing starts from here. &#x200b; what i rode is a van, but because of ""concerned citizens"" who saw me on my way home, they mistook it and reported and spread to other neighbors that i rode an \*ambulance vehicle\* instead. i chose to ignore it, then the worst thing happened. &#x200b; come this afternoon of friday, all of the passages that leads to our home inside and out has been blocked by either water drums,sack of garbages, a wooden ladder or a metal rooftop. we felt very harassed, or should i say, we were harassed. we can see barangay officials (""tanods"") watching us from afar, observing us if we ever left our house. the front our house was sprayed by an disinfectant. that was fine, i can accept that, but the fact that thy still leave it blocked until evening left us very angry and offended. it took a shouting of my mother to all of our neighbors just to remove all of the things that blocks the passages to and from our home, she was crying, because we're not infected with covid, i just became feverish so i needed to be sent to home. and even though all the passage blocks have been removed, the officials of our barangay called my mother and told her that she was not allowed to go outside and advised that instead give it to the officials in the checkpoint and let them buy from her. but my mother can't accept it because not only she wants to buy her own food, even though we were pleading to just allow my mother to be able to go outside, they're not allowing it. as we are all pums right now. &#x200b; i talked to the barangay official and pleaded again if, for the last time, just let my mother go outside as she has quarantine pass and she is obeying the protocol and disinfecting herself and all, but they said they can't allow it. i told them it's not really in me who also has the final decision, but my mother too. they told me that if we continue to persist and be stubborn, i won't be able to get a certificate from the barangay that indicated that i'm fit to work. that was the worst part. because i'm the one who is providing for my family. our father left us because he got tired of fulfilling obligations, and it's only me and my mother that are doing our best everyday to support my younger brother, who i hoped someday he can be someone who can finish college, unlike me who was an undergrad and needed to stop because i haveto support them instead of our mother the only one supporting the both of us. i don't know if its the right way to describe it, but i felt like my job was put on the line because i just had a fever. fine, harrassment is something that can be punish by law, but that's beyond our capabilities, and we don't want to enter that teritorry. we're just a little family barely scraping by to be able to live through tomorrow. &#x200b; i don't know if i'm entitled to be right. someone might just that, ""you need to obey it"", but no, it does not come that easy, the damage was already done, and it was massive. it wouldn't be much of an exagaration if you can call me a crybaby right now. &#x200b; i just wanted to share this, and i know i'm not the only one who experienced this kind of situation. &#x200b; i want you to know that it's not just the virus that is our enemy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/fydz17/day_1_of_self_quarantine/,10 04 2020
Update on Nala my Maltichon,"for anyone else wondering here's my previous post about her: [help me raise 8k php for my dog nala](https://www.reddit.com/r/philippines/comments/gn1qjm/please_help_me_raise_php_8k_for_my_dog_nala_for/) *we succesfully gathered around php 3k with all your help and i'm really glad and amazed what you people can do for a stranger's dog. maraming salamat po! sincerely from me.* so i'm posting this update para sa mga redditors na nag follow kay nala especially sa mga nag donate. **may 22:** around 2 days after i posted a cry for help sa r/philippines nala isn't getting any better, kumakain pa din may gana pero hindi na ganun kalakas kagaya dati. but thursday night hindi siya kumain which is hindi naman nakakabahala, unfortunately morning to tanghali ayaw niya pa rin kumain so i tried carrying her and kinakausap ko siya but she's not responding. nabahala ako so tinry ko siya itayo para maglakad lakad pero bumabagsak lang siya ulit, nagpanic na ako so i called his original vet if he could help. i know it's a reach kasi ecq pa pero makakapunta daw siya hintayin ko daw siya sa bahay. when he arrived he told me to rush nala sa clinic nila (his original vet clinic) so nalaman ko nagbukas na pala sila around 2nd week of may. sinugod namin si nala sa furry friends sa caloocan and luckily siya lang ang patient non. they told me na grabe na yung damage sa skin niya and saw na baka may maggots yung paws na niya. they also told me that amputation is possible kapag unrepairable na or nabubulok na sugat niya especially sa paws at sa tail. masyado dinb daw manipis balat ni nala and napakadaming flakes na nagfafall off from her body kaya siya nangangati. &#x200b; [at furry friends clinic](https://preview.redd.it/saqrwsbx70251.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9443944503ec0cdd2041bd25de98691f5de3085b) i decided to skin scrape and cbc her. never pa siya na cbc, so ayun ang goal ko kasi hindi ko alam bakit hindi pa siya gumagaling since march. sa skin scrape nakita na meron siyang demodex (hindi ko po alam spelling) pero its an insect that causes itchyness and galis. she's positive for mange. the problem is usually marami na daw yung 1 to 2 na insect sa isang skin scrape pero sa kanya 12 (take note na hindi pa yun sa sugat kumuha) which indicates na sobrang abnormal na ng dami nung parasites. &#x200b; [shivers and cleaning ng sugat niya](https://preview.redd.it/eewwtclz70251.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=47d84285281125ed50cf12986e72905fba1b77b2) they told me this is caused by stress. dapat daw na cocontrol ng immune system niya yung pagdami nun kaso dahil na stress siya most probably because of the grooming kasi dun nagsimula siya mangati, sobrang dumami yung demodex. they even showed me what's on the microscope. nakakalungkot isipin na dahil lang sa simpleng grooming nagkaganyan na yung dating healthy na siya. cbc came out and they saw an abnormality sa mga components. may bacterial infection siya kaya bumababa ata ang hemoglobin niya hindi ko gaanong sure. while we were discussing, nala started to shiver and the doctor said na kinokombulsyon siya kasi 40 degrees yung temperature niya. &#x200b; [sorry nabura na yung cbc na naka attach, i also lost the computation how much it costs but naka php 3200 ako, she has around 6 na iniintake and a spray, plus the three injections.](https://preview.redd.it/z82q4n1380251.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9adfcdb1977fff2d30706a925e9023975745cb67) &#x200b; https://preview.redd.it/50ji08fa80251.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bea67e1d3f2a8d1a55a0fcf680fe2d1c326b73b0 they cleaned her sugat. and injected her three times. yung dalawa anti mange/anti parasite and yung isa for her fever. they told me na this will be a 6 week long na gamutan and babalik kami dun every friday starting 22. i agreed. they also told me to stop seeking for convenia because it'll be too costly and hindi sure na gagana, at least eto daw proven, they told me to make nala sa comfortable as possible to reduce her stress. bumalik na kami last friday and the doctors said na shes getting better albeit she lost .4 kg. pinalitan na din namin diet niya to reflex pero hindi niya gaanong kinakain. she's still weak, barely walking but nakakalakad na at least. the first 3 days din from 22 kamot siya ng kamot as in walang tigil kaya nakaka stress pero since monday she stopped itching na. nagtatanggalan na langib niya din. &#x200b; [her favorite spot on my chair](https://preview.redd.it/evaj95l190251.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=575df5eb0c79a5f0e8595cdfc248329bbbb63014) &#x200b; &#x200b; [latest pic, hindi na reddish skin niya and nagtatanggalan na scabs niya.](https://preview.redd.it/lpfmo7t390251.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4cbf0b6cdff492d9a6045c04268ec1345d1f9533) i**'m here to post this update to thank you guys for the support.** masakit man, pero kelangan ko kayo because some of my family members think na sayang lang ang pera sa kanya at ipamigay na lang daw namin tapos bumili na lang kami ng aso. i had arguments with my family because of this. maraming salamat po, she's recovering slowly pero hindi namin siya titigilan hanggang sa hindi siya gumagaling! **donations are still welcome, sobrang maappreciate namin yung donation because i barely have anything left.** 6 weeks na gamutan pa siya and every week may injection sa kanya. i hope na you guys are still willing to donate to an anonymous stranger and his dog. *if you are willing to donate please drop me a dm. pwede na din po bank kasi nakausap ko na gf ko and she lent me her bank account for donations.* ***please dm me for account # or gcash.*** &#x200b; thank you so much!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/gtqe7f/update_on_nala_my_maltichon/,31 05 2020

Need help diagnosing sickness!,"hi r/philippines! i am feeling quite sick and doctors haven't been able to provide any help. i am an american who spent about two weeks in the philippines in june/july. i was out in a more rural area for a little less than a week in antique on panay. then i was at borocay for a few days and then manila for a brief time. i ate lots of food i've never seen before including balut, vampire stew, and more. i felt fine the whole trip. two days after returning (almost a month ago now) i become very sick. i had a high fever, a terrible headache, loss of appetite, insomnia, and a swollen throat. it lasted for about 5 days. it was probably the most sick i've ever been. after that i felt completely fine. i tested negative for covid and influenza. 2 or 3 weeks later now, i am sick again but with some different symptoms. i have a slight headache, a swollen throat, i have no appetite and occasionally feel sick at the sight of food (haven't thrown up yet), and i feel incredibly cold. the opposite of a fever, i think my body temperature has actually decreased and i sometimes feel freezing. this has been going on for 6 days now. doctors here do not seem to recognize what this could be. i feel incredibly anxious because i've never felt sick like this. any ideas? i had a great time visiting otherwise. thank you !",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/15n811q/need_help_diagnosing_sickness/,10 08 2023
"Unpopular Opinion on Vaccines: Allocation, Economics, and China","r/philippines had always been a stronghold that dds can't penetrate but i think the community is taking it too far lately and i fear the caution might morph some of you into anti-vaxxers. here's two cents from a guy who lurks in r/phinvest who thought he could cash in on pfizer's stock before realizing that the covid vaccine wouldn't make a dent to its $50b revenue stream due to non-profit commitments from the likes of astrazeneca and j&j (aka likely to be zero profits) and revenue sharing agreement with biontech (aka 50 off agad ang revenues) **vaccine costs**. pharma companies price their products differently according to their r&d costs. pricing goes as low as $4 for astrazeneca-oxford to $35 for moderna. bu**t i don't see the likes of us or canada arguing that they shouldn't buy pfizer just because it's 500% more expensive than astrazeneca.** we can argue about corruption all day and we know it's heavily ingrained in philippine society but having the vaccines arrive in our country asap to relieve the burden from our frontliners is way more important. i simply hope politicking won't take a toll on the vaccination timeline unlike brazil's situation. **allocation**. a billion doses don't just pop out of thin air. fact is, first world countries already secured 80% of available vaccine while only having 17% of the world's population. this is only normal -- for example, the us has plowed more than $1b into astrazeneca alone for vaccine research in exchange for getting first-dibs. <insert classic dds meme of ""ano ambag niyo?"" here> you might wonder why india has 500m doses of astrazeneca (the same as us). the reason there is that the world's largest vaccine manufacturer is there -- serum institute of india. those having a eureka moment and wanting to fly off to delhi might want to reconsider tho: india isn't better off currently seeing how they're having a bong go moment. **debt.** the faster we can get our frontlines inoculated, the better. the faster we can get the economy running, the less deaths there will be. debt? the hell.. this is human lives we're talking in a world that is flirting with zero interest rates. i would care more on the gdp, productivity, and labor market and then worry on the debt later. this isn't the marcos era where interest rates were like 18% p.a. lastly, **china**. there's a growing mistrust on two of china's largest vaccine manufacturers -- sinovac and sinopharm. **first of all, anti-dds please use common sense when it comes to fda/ema approvals.** china isn't even *supplying* the vaccine to the west but rather to regional peers of middle east and asean. this is like expecting the fda or ema to approve the pinoy version of viagra ""robust"" even when it's not being sold there (technically it's illegal as tadalafil needs a prescription). why do people think airfreighting millions of vaccine doses is easy? it isn't. the exception to this is latin america or, to be specific, brazil as sinovac has a partnership with one of the world's leading biotech institutes -- são paulo-based butantan institute. in fact, i can't even fault indonesia for ordering 3x as more vaccines from china than we did. and that's a country that has historically persecuted their indo-chinese community (ooof). the country's state-owned vaccine manufacturer bio farma said that indonesia cannot purchase pfizer's vaccine given the logistical challenges in distributing it as they do not have the proper cold chain network. do filipinos think the philippines has the proper facilities? tayo? are you kidding me? astra's great that they only need fridge temperatures (2-8c) and i'm only happy to see the country secure 2.6m doses. but pfizer's -70c requirements? moderna's -20c? how will our country even store that liquid gold? it just isn't feasible on mass scale. on the issue where china ordered pfizer vaccines. dood, they're supposed to churn out 1.6 billion doses of their own vaccines in 2021 while other countries only ordered 288m doses. if you think china's doing charity, they aren't. more like trying to hoard more vaccines to me. lastly, for those who can't trust china, just know that we aren't the sole country being guinea pigs. uae has already approved emergency use for it a week ago and china has been using it several months before. last shoutout goes to roque kasi ang bobo ng mandatory face shield policy. p.s. for further reading or i-need-data moments, i highly recommend you take a look into duke university's compiled data over at [https://launchandscalefaster.org/covid-19](https://launchandscalefaster.org/covid-19)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/kgrccw/unpopular_opinion_on_vaccines_allocation/,20 12 2020

Covid positive here. Could any fellow positives share how you think you got Covid? I think it would help others be more careful. In my case I think I got infected at a barber shop.,"i am certain i got covid from a barbershop. i went to get a haircut on the 31st and all the barbershops were closed except for one. there was a barber who was coughing. a lot. he was cutting the hair of an unmasked older gentleman who didnt seem to mind. the barber told me to sit down because he will be done shortly with cutting the hair of the older person then it would be my turn. i should have walked out. normally i avoid people coughing but i thought it didnt matter as this was the 31st - before news of the big surge. i also thought that the barber was coughing due to the cold weather. i didn't walk out. instead i had my haircut by another barber in the same shop. i hope the older guy is okay. :-( i'm fully vaxxed with astrazeneca and boostered with moderna. edit: and i have flu vaxx too. as for me i'm ok - no more colds,- slight cough with sore throat - isolating right now. 02 sats never dropped below 97 although i had a nonstop runny nose for four days. it's the worst i've ever had in my life. can you guys please share how you think you got covid? i think it would help others be more careful.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/rx1xu7/covid_positive_here_could_any_fellow_positives/,6 01 2022

The special ̶p̶o̶w̶e̶r̶s̶ ̶o̶f̶ ̶ Koko Pimentel,"by his own admission, he was on self-quarantine: “i quarantined myself since march 11, 2020, and already tried to limit my movements.” his wife’s own words: “he had been in quarantine for weeks in a separate bedroom.” (n.b. “for weeks”) let’s be somber and check how the koko pimentel's fare vis-à-vis the following filipinos in similar circumstances: a 60-year-old man in caloocan died last saturday because the injudiciously planned lockdown prevented him from getting transport to his dialysis sessions. his thrice-weekly dialysis was his only chance to live a productive life, but he had lost access to the treatment. in just a week of lockdown, his body had bloated. he died of kidney failure. ~~but for koko and his wife, they had the privilege to forum-shop for hospitals. denied at one hospital, they proceeded to makati medical center.~~ the brothers gerald and mark libiran are both in the health care frontlines. gerald is an aide at the philippine orthopedic center who works 10 hours a day, three times a week. mark, his brother, works at the national children’s hospital where he had just completed four days straight duty. the brothers were on a motorcycle to take the two-hour ride to their santa maria, bulacan home. with no public conveyances, that was their only way to reach home and rest for the next hospital duty. they were flagged down for violating the prohibition on back rides, despite showing work identification cards. “my heart sunk when i learned that the penalty was p5,000. that’s half of my salary for the month,” said gerald. ~~but for the pimentels, the license plates of a senator’s car facilitate ease of entry, plus other support vehicles for bodyguards.~~ the 69-year-old homeless dorothy espejo sleeps on the pavements of malate. she was apprehended by law enforcers, booked at the police station for a mug shot and charged with resistance to authority. but to where could a destitute itinerant have gone home? a home for dorothy is the government’s solution. ~~the arresting police instead told her they needed to set an example. yet for koko, the justice secretary was quick to say, “the doj will temper the rigor of the law with human compassion.”~~ koko said his self-quarantine started march 11, the last day of the senate sessions. we all know the senate became pestilent after a committee hearing resource person had later tested positive. we go by his own account that led to his self-quarantine: march 14 he started having body pains and flu symptoms; he then slept in a room separate from his wife; march 18 he had a 38-degree fever and sore throat. he was correct for following the protocol that as a person under monitoring (he came from a risk area, he manifested the symptoms), self-quarantine was required. let’s be redundant to take his word for it: he tried to limit his movements and slept in a separate bedroom. on march 16, five days after his self-imposed quarantine, he went shopping ~~at the membership club s&r at bonifacio global city. he checked out at counter 13 at 1:59 p.m. he breached his home quarantine protocol. he lied.~~ cctv cameras did not. grocery workers are frontliners, too, for being at the receiving end of viral risk. when koko’s test came out on march 24, s&r bgc had to quarantine those within contagious distance of the ~~self-quarantined-but-lied~~ former senate president. the homeless dorothy espejo is in jail but not koko ~~who did not use his kokote~~. dr. israel bactol and others who succumbed but got their positive test results only after they had died is not pardonable ~~when the marcos family got theirs in only a day~~. in a pandemic of chasm between the rich and the poor, the defenseless perish first. ~~koko pimentel and a government with no compulsion to protect its citizens have just prescribed the recipe for mass panic and mass contagion. bong go can go breach the metro manila quarantine again when a fire breaks out in another city like he did in butuan city~~. ~~mediocrities of haughty entitlements and militarism to solve a medical crisis?~~ strikethrough all vip entitlements. &#x200b; written by: **by:** [antonio montalvan ii](https://twitter.com/antoniojmontal2?s=20)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/frzete/the_special_powers_of_koko_pimentel/,30 03 2020
What does Albularyo do (witch doctor/folk healer)? Do they really do something? May naniniwala pa ba sa kanila in this generation?,"so i have a brother, he's 25 year old. we rushed him twice in the hospital this week. pero prior pa sa mga episodes na'to, he's feeling symptoms already eg. tightness of chest, nagka-cramps ang katawan niya, difficulty sleeping, nahihirapan huminga, etc. after all the medical exams, okay naman lahat ng results niya, normal lahat ng test. a friend of his advised him to go to albularyo (which i am against kasi i think he's having mental health problems talaga which affects he's overall being since yung mga symptoms niya ay linked to anxiety and depression eg. panic attacks/difficulty breathing). but i just let them para sa peace of mind na rin na atleast we all did everything possible kahit na talagang kapos kami, we just don't want him to feel na pinapabayaan namin siya. so fastforward kung saan pumunta yung albularyo sa bahay, wala naman siyang masyadong ginawa. may sinabi na may lumalaro raw sa kapatid ko (nangkukulam daw sa kanya), mas marami pa actually yung pagboboast niya na he's done something for someone, na siya yung reason kung bakit nalaman kung sino yung kumuha sa wallet ng isa niyang pasyente (?). he's just engaging us in the conversation. he also said na yung mga ibibigay niyang papakuluan at iinumin ay exported pa raw and such. and to my surprise p4000 lahat yung siningil niya for that session only. he's not the typical albularyo rin, naka-car siya and mukha namang well-off. do you think reasonable yun as bayad? i mean, may mga naririnig naman na akong albularyo before pero usually hindi ganun kalaki ang hinihingi nila. since parang act of altruism yon in their part since meron silang god-given gift. i don't have anything against sa mga albularyo or naniniwala/nagpeperform nga mga ganoong rituals pero i felt robbed for me and sa kuya ko kasi we chipped in sa bayad. malaking bagay na yon para samin, he's living paycheck to paycheck and i'm still reviewing for my boards so big deal talaga yun sakin. and if ever may magtanong kung bakit hindi ko na lang sinuggest na magvisit ng psychologist. it is still not acknowledge sa amin, especially sa pamilya namin. and simply not accessible. (how can i put it into words) parang still stuck sa phase na ""nasa isip mo lang yan."" bottomline, are albularyos a thing? am i just overreacting sa bayad? edit: i'm reading all your comments guys and i really appreciate them. pero hindi ko lahat ma-process right now kasi my manung just talked to the albularyo, and he's asking him 5k kasi may ritual daw silang gagawin bukas and he's gonna bathe him with god knows what and how, at hindi pa sure kung yun na yung last na hihingin niya. and he assured him daw na 'pag 'di gumaling, ibabalik daw yung binayad. i really can't process anything right now kasi i'm thinking na baka this is only the beginning nung mga paghingi hingi niya, and knowing my brother he really won't listen to any of us. edit: please don't share this with any platform update: i took your advice guys and told him na he should instead see a therapist since malaking bagay yung hinihinging 5k. i also forwarded informative videos na very similar sa mga symptoms na nafifeel niya na linked to anxiety. unfortunately, umutang daw siya ng pambayad and binayaran na niya. and he won't acknowledge yung idea na maybe he has anxiety. sobrang close minded niya with regards doon. i'll just hope and pray for the placebo effect.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/17nhpid/what_does_albularyo_do_witch_doctorfolk_healer_do/,4 11 2023

Thoughts on our health care system in covid's time,"what's wrong with our country are we the only ones who's experiencing this kind of dilemma when it comes to health treatment? like if you were to get sick or have some underlying conditions that has a single symptom of covid, you were labeled as ""pui"" and therefore, not accepted in any hospitals just because of that one symptom? seriously? so are we just bound to die if we do have other illnesses that has the symptom of covid? how about those who have asthma? are they labeled as pui and be recommended on a covid hospital? like up until now is there really any progress we're making? we can't even differentiate normal illness to covid, everything is covid nowadays, is this how it should be managed? or it's just that our country is just awful? also, my beloved relative died recently. he's a good person. sadly, they weren't able to admit him to hospital because he has a single symptom which is breathing difficulty, which was from his underlying condition from his lungs an old illness of him. he was having a hard time already and yet, he was denied being accepted in hospitals and the reason was they are already full for covid???? can't they examine the patients first before making an assumption??? is there any healthcare workers out there or someone who has the knowledge why we are living in such an awful state where does who really needs help were always declined due to ""safety policy"" which their policy that causes more deaths. this is not an attack or to hate our health system today, it's just that we also need to know what else can we do in this kind of state? are we going to stop our underlying conditions until a vaccine is ready?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/i9g9i8/thoughts_on_our_health_care_system_in_covids_time/,14 08 2020

Philippine Healthcare,"hello! i'd like to share another frustrating experience i recently had. a while back, i talked about the impact of inflation, but today, i want to vent about a different issue. in my previous post, someone commented about how a single illness could plunge you into a mountain of debt. well, that hit home for me recently. i ended up in the hospital for four days. initially, we considered going to a public hospital, but due to a lack of necessary equipment for tests, they redirected me to a private one. the moment i stepped into the emergency room, my mind was already grappling with the impending bill. i'm well aware of how it goes – every interaction with a doctor, every nurse who attends to you, every medication, every test – it all translates to money. the second headache in this ordeal is the doctors. i can't fathom why they always seem to be running late. we kept asking the hospital staff about the doctor, and all they would say is that the doctor shows up whenever they decide to do their rounds. unfortunately, that turned out to be true, as i waited a whopping 27 hours for a brief, maybe two-minute, checkup. throughout my entire stay, the doctor only spoke to me three times, yet the bill for their services alone soared to 9k. and that's not even factoring in the emergency room doctor and the fees for the lab tests. as a bit of background, i don't have health insurance because the monthly premiums are beyond my means. i do keep my philhealth payments up to date, but it only covered around 7k of my total bill. it's disheartening to think that we pay taxes with the expectation that public hospitals would have the necessary equipment to care for us, only to find out that they don't. private hospitals take advantage of this lack of choice, and it feels like we're left without any options. i sincerely hope that the government starts prioritizing hospitals in the provinces. i still count myself lucky to snag a spot in a private hospital. what about folks relying on over-the-counter meds just to ease the pain, only to kick the bucket at home without a clue about their illness because a simple checkup costs a pretty penny? some can't even make it to the nearest hospital. no hate here; i know we're all hip to how messed up our healthcare system is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/181mk9w/philippine_healthcare/,22 11 2023
Looking for a third country for my Filipina girlfriend and I to meet in.,"hello everyone. like many people, i have been dating a filipina for a little over a month now. we’ve really hit it off. talking and facetiming for 8-12 hours every day since day one. she has a passport and i’ve just recently applied for my own (american btw). neither of us have any visas. given the current covid and quarantining status in the philippines, along with how it’s damn near impossible to get a us visa for a single filipina, we are looking to meet up in a third country. any suggestions? i’m looking to spend 1-2 weeks with her. we don’t know what countries are available to the both of us. it’s really becoming a headache and i was wondering if anyone on here has done this recently. i’m honestly open to anywhere, but generally speaking the cheaper and safer, the better. edit- there seems to be a bit of judgement and criticism. i honestly didn’t think people would care all that much.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/o359bg/looking_for_a_third_country_for_my_filipina/,19 06 2021

OFW question: OEC process for Japan vs other countries,"tldr; polo japan (both tokyo and osaka) are giving us a lot of headache right now in acquiring oecs, especially for those who are applying for a simple change of employer status (already registered in poea database). background: i came to japan on a legal working visa, with a proper oec, until i switched companies in 2019. i applied for change of employer status; got all my requirements stamped and verified - but failed to return to the ph to ""complete the verification and new oec acquisition process"" due to the pandemic. the verified employment contract naturally ""expired"" but i got renewed. polo says nope, you have to apply again - and meh, i thought i wouldn't be coming home any soon anyway, so i'll just try again in a few more years. and then apparently, 1. last year polo required all japanese employers hiring filipinos to get a ph partner agency, or else their filipino employees will never be granted oecs. 2. there was a bit of outrage at this, so the agency rule was scrapped - but ofws still need to get their contracts verified. but the thing is, only the standard employment contract is accepted with all the insurance / repatriation compliances, such as 1. ofws need to sign up for compulsory life insurance (and only ph-based insurance companies are accepted) 2. translations of documents need to be done via authorized translators. even if these were originally in english, apparently they still need an original translation (like, wtf?). 3. employer's government id is needed for submission and translation - except, japanese companies and admin are very touchy about privacy issues (legal basis) and will not consider giving us a copy of their private documents. so tanong ko lang, is the oec acquisition for those who changed visa status / employers this complicated? also, apparently we still have to go back to the ph to complete the oec process (as in dun pa talaga sa poea kukuha ng new oec). polo japan won't provide us an oec even if we do manage to get our docs verified. is this oec process the same in other countries?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/v0yy1a/ofw_question_oec_process_for_japan_vs_other/,30 05 2022

How do people get mental health help or treatment if they cannot afford it?,"i just wonder, i looked up psychiatrists and pinakamura is p1500 per session so far. how do the ""average"" people afford to continue sessions for their mental health, aside from the initial diagnosis? sobrang mahal kasi and i don't think kaya ko idagdag sa expenses namin. however, sobrang pagod narin ako and i desperately need help at this point. i keep having migraines and i had to get a medical certificate for work related reasons. the doctor wanted to know the cause of my persistent migraines and headache, i said i only sleep for 3 hours a day. i told her i can't sleep. i keep doing things all day, moving around the house, cleaning, putting away things, doing small projects, giving the house a makeover, etc. basically, doing useless things so i push back the things i need to do and then it causes me to sleep less or basically no sleep at all, aside from weekends when i'm already too exhausted to the point na sagad na sagad na. i also told her that my mind keeps on working even when at rest. i keep recreating scenes i am imagining i'm talking to someone or someone in my past or someone i want to talk to. other times, i replay memories in my head. i don't have problems at home or at work, just the usual financial troubles. although, she traced it back to a traumatic event a year ago which has given me ""emotional trauma"". i have never been this way and i told her i don't feel like myself most days. i feel like i am another person, in a trance, just going through life but since i'm highly aware i am functioning well. i guess this is why people will say there might be nothing wrong with me but it doesn't feel right. nevertheless, her initial diagnosis is ocd since i always have impulses to do things i can't stop myself from doing plus the other symptoms she listed. she gave me medicine to help me sleep but she thinks i need anti-anxiety meds so she recommended me to see a psychiatrist to get officially diagnosed and for further medication. anyway, our health card doesn't cover mental health concerns. anyone can recommend near pasig/bgc or online? i already saw this list but i am wondering for more updated recommendations or personal experience or any help is needed. -> https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealthph/comments/vu31vp/list_of_suggested_phbased/ also, i don't think i can line up for free since i am already ""preoccupied"". i have a full time job, i have a kid and family and aside from the other things that takes up my time and takes away my sleeping hours, i don't have the strength or will to go out of the house a long time. sorry. i don't mean to be a choosing beggar. i earn fairly okay, maybe 30k a month. i can spare some money but not p1500 or more per session. thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/z0z02v/how_do_people_get_mental_health_help_or_treatment/,21 11 2022
Legal advice on tenants refusing to pay and move out,"we have a tenant that haven't been paying for about a year and they still refuse to move out. the gist of the events are: 1. before pandemic: they have not paid rent for 3 months 2. we started the legal procedures to have them move out 3. 3 hearings with the barangay and it hasn't been resolved 4. pandemic: they refuse to pay because of the rent policy 5. sept/oct: restarted legal procedures to have them move out. barangay still refuses to cooperate after 5 hearings. 6. dec: no progress. tbh, this whole mess has been causing our family stress for a year already. they also demand that we allow them to sign a new contract next year without paying their previous debt and kept on threating to kill us etc. the barangay captain also refuse to sign documents and kept on siding with them. we honestly don't know how to deal with them anymore. they've causing a lot of headache for my family besides the rent payment issue so we just really want them to move out already asap. edit: thank you for the replies. this helps gives us an idea what we can do next. unfortunately we weren't able to record them threating us and the other stuff they did kase biglaan lang niya sinasabi so di kame prepared lagi. also according to what my dad heard, tatakot daw ung barangay captain dun sa tenant baka daw barilin siya kase muslin. not sure kung may nabaril na ba siya before dito sa street namen pero matapang din kase ung family nila pag nangaaway. looking into the power and water supply suggestions. edit: thank you again sa mga replies. in the end, umalis na din sila dahil hindi sila nagbabayad ng electric bills since last year and naputulan na ung house na un now. regarding sa lawyer, 100k daw? and hindi daw likely na may masisingil kame so hindi na siya natuloy. nakakafrustrate na ending since talong talo kame. wala kame nasingil after more than a year then nagiwan pa ng utang na 20k+ sa bills and naistress lang kame sa buong pangyayari for more than a year. puro benefits lang ang nakuha nila since they got to live there for a year for free without consequences. thankful naman na umalis na sila pero kakafrustrate pa din after everything.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/kj3mzg/legal_advice_on_tenants_refusing_to_pay_and_move/,23 12 2020
I'm actually one of the few people who thrived during this pandemic lock down.,"i always hear sad news of people getting stranded in manila, losing their jobs. i'm updated on all of that is happening right now. i get messages from friends that they don't know what to do anymore. the government does not know what it is doing. many people are losing hope. i'm also sad for all of that. i don't want people dying or losing their business. but deep inside me, i don't want to admit publicly, but this lock down saved me. reason why i thrived: 1. i'm one of the few lucky people who can work remotely. my work entirely happens online. a year ago, i decided to move outside of manila. i established my home somewhere accessible from the city but can still isolate myself from people. i'm connected to internet via fiber. before, working from home was only limited to few days a week. 2. i can work and grow my food now. i can now appreciate that taste of fresh picked veg. 3. the time i saved from commute/travel gave me time to exercise, jog and breath fresh air all the time. i feel healthier. 4. i have more time and better relationship. 5. i could do my passion after working hours, like taking photos of the night sky, learning a language and catching up with all my reading. 6. the freeze in mortgage payments allowed me to use my money to payout almost all my debt on my credit card which gave me a headache for the last 3 years. i'm planning to cut it this september. i usually communicate to my friends and my family online even before this pandemic because most of us are living away from each other. i am more comfortable doing something on my own. i don't feel the need to go outside and attend parties. actually, i prefer small, simple gatherings. i don't want to say i hate people, i just say i don't feel the need now and my new adopted cats keep me company",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/i0gzgi/im_actually_one_of_the_few_people_who_thrived/,30 07 2020
Do Marriage Certificates From Virtual Weddings Have To Be Registered With The PSA (Philippine Statistics Authority)?,"hello all, i am trying to find out the answer to a very specific question, so i wanted to ask it in the philippines section, since it pertains to the philippines... here are the details- i am an american guy who has been living in the philippines for the last 5 years my girlfriend is a filipina who has been living with me in the same house for the last 2 and a half years we both want to go back to the usa to live together. we have decided that, due to the insane amount of backlogged k1 visas the philippines is currently experiencing which is making the k1 route take way longer than usual, **we will do the cr1 spousal route instead**. the thing is, though, the philippines is the only country in the world that does not allow divorce. this means, if we do end up getting married, and, a decade or two later on, we end up getting a divorce, and, my filipina gf meets a filipino guy that she wants to marry, then i want my filipina gf to not have to experience the horrible legal battle that she would have to take part in to get a foreign recognition of divorce. we have both spoken about the possibility of divorce maturely and we both want to make sure that this would be avoided in the case that we get divorced and then she wants to marry a filipino. so, this is my question - if we get married via a virtual marriage service that has the officiator based in the us (like a service such as webwed or a utah zoom marriage), **would our marriage certificate need to be registered with the psa (philippine statistics authority) before the us embassy in manila grants us a** **spousal visa****?** the answer to this question is critical, because if we do not have to register our marriage certificate with the psa, then that means the philippine government would not have any ""record"" of the marriage happening for my girlfriend, and would therefore pose no problems if we got divorced and my gf wanted to marry a native filipino (since it would look like she's never been married in the first place, in the eyes of the philippine government). but, if we do have to register our marriage certificate with the psa, then the philippine government would have a record of the marriage (and would therefore cause a huge headache if we divorced and she wanted to marry a filipino man). thanks so much all for any clarifications in this. if anyone has gone through this personally i would be super interested. thanks",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/sihh5t/do_marriage_certificates_from_virtual_weddings/,2 02 2022

"Just a rant from a tired, full-time teacher who works as a freelance artist","a full-time employee, would get paid per hour within their schedule for the day. which means, that if their day starts at 8 am and ends at 5 pm, they get paid for 8 hours (excluding one-hour lunch break). which means, any work done outside of their schedule will be unpaid (except paid overtimes because not all overtime is paid). since my work hours for the entire week vary each day, the amount i get daily also differs. to make it more relevant, the workload each week, exceeds that of the paid hours, meaning the amount of workload i get to do per week is not at par with the amount i get in the said pay-conditions in that week. some week are less hellish than the others but most definitely are. 'yung tipong mapapamura ka nalang because of the extra workload and you'll get 0 peso and 1900 of bad to worse headaches out of it so, big damn. on other hand, as a freelance artist, i get paid for being commissioned to do an art piece, get paid for the nth revision that's beyond the number of the free revisions within the rough sketch part, i get paid for the amount of colors i put in the piece, get paid for the details that increases depending on its specificity, i get paid for the number of extra characters, and get paid for the complexity of the background. basically as a freelance artist, i get to be compensated for every step i do with the work i'm doing. in terms of compensation, clearly, freelancing is the winner, but being able to thrive as a freelance artist is something that requires a good amount of skill, talent, practice, effort, and most importantly, luck and privilege. so, should people do freelance jobs nalang because of the compensation gap? definitely not. leaving the employees suffer and letting the big corporations have their way with us is not the answer. employees deserve more than a fixed paygrade that is disproportionate with the amount of workload x the time rendered. we're not lab rats who do an astoundingly huge amount of work only to be undercompensated. we're not employed to be at their beck and call all the time and get nothing out of it. corporate greed is extremely disgusting. our country needs to learn how to communicate pay in a more professional, relaxed, and open manner pre- and during employment. nakakaurat, pamahal nang pamahal bills, padami nang padami 'yung trabaho.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/nb9gf1/just_a_rant_from_a_tired_fulltime_teacher_who/,13 05 2021

Ako lang ba nakaranas nito? Di ko alam at nalilito ako,"(bad english ahead. sorry in advance since parang feeling ko mas madali pa i explain sa engilsh) i don't know if this is the right or appropriate subreddit to ask this but this feeling is getting me annoyed. so before it happened ""again"" my mind are clear or normal (i don't know the right word or how would i interpret it). i can do my shit, enjoy what i enjoy, and study at my own pace or just procrastinate while i'm in my well being. well i have some worries and stress since our mid-term exams starts right after our christmas and new year break but it wasn't to the point that it took a toll on me. anyway, so after celebrating new year with my family, i finally went to my bedroom. it was around past 1 am when i went to sleep. then around 4 am i wake up feeling like my head is being squeezed or something? i don't know how would i describe it but it is like a feeling when you sleep on an uncomfortable pillow that probably affected the blood flow in the head or brain in which case it is more likely like that since i found out that the pillow that i've used is not that soft or comfortable to rest your head on that probably put a pressure in my head. i wake up like my head is thinking nothing? i can't really focus or rest at that time. it's not a feeling headache or something like that. i don't know and it confuses me. it is like... let say that my brain is a cpu and it is in idle or rest mode but it's using 100% of its cores or like that. after that i felt sluggish or groggy in that morning i cant eat my breakfast properly since i'm feeling down. i can't focus and i instantly lost interest to the things i like to do, play, or watch. i lost my enjoyment to the things i found interesting or liked, lost my motivation, i lost my appetite, i felt depressed and since i can't focus and i'm a freshman and studying. i felt more anxious and depresed because i can't focus. and now i felt lost and confuse, can't put my focus on things because i slept on a uncomfortable pillow after new year. i feel restless and depressed on what happening to me right now but compare to the first few days i think it is a little bit better but it's still there. it's been a week since i stop playing games in my phone and pc or read some literatures in my free time since my interest or focus are like non-existent right after new year and at this moment. i feel dark or i feel like that this isn't me and i'm getting depressed/stressed because of it. the reason why i quoted ""again"" in my 2nd paragraph because i believe this the 3rd time or 2nd time that it happened to me. the first time that this happened to me is when i'm still at my high-school, probably around 2 years ago and i waked up with the same feeling(from what i described above) and i think much worse? and the same reason too and suspect in which are the uncomfortable pillow. during those time i felt really weak and sleepy for a week. i forgot what did i do for me to came back to normal back then. now since i'm taking online classes and i need to fit a time to study and do my school related stuff, i have less time to think on how i will return to my normal self and i don't know what to do. i hope anyone can help me regarding on what happening to me right now. sorry for the somewhat long post or if it sounds stupid. should i just take a rest and i'm just overthinking? p.s i tried searching regarding about this but i can't find any similar experiences that happened to me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ksairl/ako_lang_ba_nakaranas_nito_di_ko_alam_at_nalilito/,7 01 2021
I wish I can greet him Happy Father's Day,"tatay was a man of few words. he rarely show emotion, even to us family. but i love how he shows and make us feel loved by working tirelessly to provide for our daily needs, crafting diy projects from custom shelves, tv stands, cabinets, etc. every saturday night he'll ask us to buy some snacks while he prepare our dvd player to watch a movie. he just wanted a simple life, he worked his ass off for us to finish college, and never asked something in return, he only wants us to have be content and happy with our lives. his love is always for us, albeit in silence. years after i had my first job, and starting to pay off our debts, i'm starting buy gifts for him at random occasions, buying groceries for the family, slowly trying to let him be at ease. but everything changed last year. december 2019, he's been mentioning his frequent headaches, thinking it could just be caused by his failing eyesight. he wants to get checked but only got one by january 2020, that's when we were referred to a neuro and then have an mri scan. he even refused at that point since he knew mri scan is not cheap, but later agreed upon knowing it is covered by the health card i got for him and nanay. few days after getting an mri scan, we returned to the neuro. that was the time the doctor told us the what they found in the scan, a 4.5cm x 4cm x 4cm tumor on the right side of his brain - part of brain responsible for organizing thoughts, speech some motor functions. hearing the news, i can help but step a little back and hold my tears while the doctor explains everything, all the while i remember those occassions in the past few months when he's stutterring noticeably, his left eyesight getting poorer, his left limbs getting spasms, and a lot more. later on, the doctor mentioned it needs to be removed and have a biopsy. knowing tatay, i know he'll refuse. and he did, citing that surgery could cost us more than half a million. he only asked to have a second opinion, but the doctor told us the same thing. he's adamant of what the 2 neurologist have told us. he said it could just be something else, perhaps a simple headache. and then the pandemic came and lock downs happened. in few weeks time, we noticed an abrupt change in tatay's condition, stutters became more notiecable, he's losing balance, and he's losing weight. then asked around how to score an appointment to a doctor during lockdown, that's when we got referred to a neurosurgeon. upon sending mri scan we had 3 months prior, he immediately called us and explained everything, convinced tatay to take the surgery. but we were in the middle of pandemic that time, pgh can't take our case other regional hospitals too. we had no choice but to have a surgery in a private hospital, the third doctor that we had referred us to another neurosurgeon that specializes on brain tumors. it was late may, when tatay had his crainiotomy. tatay had a successful surgery, and from a 5cm tumor they were able to remove 5.5cmx7.9cmx6cm tumor, a biopsy was then ordered. tatay also had a great recovery, since he was awake during the whole surgery, the doctor told us that if all goes well he can be discharged in a week. in a week, i have to go to each and every doctor to ask for discount to their pf, had to pull some strings in the hospital and pull out loans without the knowledge of tatay, and also through the help of family and friends tatay got discharged. that same day he got discharged, i vividly remember i went out to get groceries and a cake for tatay, doctor called and told that biopsy results came. tumor was a malignant one, and told me to get back to him as soon as i can. i was lining up at the counter that time, my knees getting weak and can't even hold my tears back while in front of the cashier. going home, i don't even know how am i going to tell them. i have to keep it for a day and let my family enjoy tatay's return from a successful surgery. a day later, and doctor's secretary called reminding us of our appointment after two weeks. that reminded me that i need tell them the results of the biopsy, and i told them that same day. two weeks later, doctor explained everything in full details. the tumor that were removed was indeed a cancerous one, and not just cancerous, a rare type and an aggressive one. again, it's me, nanay and tatay in the clinic, everyone's silent. and tatay asked about survival rate and how long he's going to live. it. again silence. and doctor told him that he only has about a year to live, if lucky, a few more months up to two years. after that, he referred us to another doctor. now, a neuro-oncologist. it was a silent trip going home. we don't even know what to say. doctor reminded me to set an appointment right away since tatay might need to start therapies sooner. from tatay's next doctor, she told us everything we need to know, what to expect and the finances needed, and again tatay asked the same thing survival rate and life expectancy, and she answered the same thing. from this point onward, we have to expect the worst. it was painful for me to keep reminding myself that tatay cpuld be gone in less than a year. tatay soon started his chemo and radiotherapy sessions. months later something hit tatay, he became covid positive. but his body took it well, he's asymptomatic. but still he pushed to be in quarantine that time, and only nanay can take care of him. after twsting negative, he then resumed his theraphy and finally finishing all his sessions. from here onwards, it was us now taking care of tatay, making sure he takes his medicine, eating well, and recording if we notice anything wrong. aside from the bi-monthly checkups and getting sets of chemotherapy tablets, tatay mostly stayed at home. it was a roller-coaster ride, we had fo endure his mood swings, depressive states and his the emotional stress he's going through. it was painful for us to see him that way. tatay who i mostly see as a strong-willed person crying he's going to die soon. tatay's emotion became erratic, sometimes you can just hear him play some games or watch videos in his phone, somethime you'll hear him crying, or shouting. it was early this year that his health started gradually decline again. doctor ordered an mri again, aside from his monthly ones, then we found another mas in his brain it's was at 7cm that time and knew it's growing so fast since they didn't see 2 or 3 weeks prior. we were given an option to operate on it again or ultimately wait for the inevitable. going home, we had to ask tatay and he refused the operation, saying it's useless if upon removing it will come back. we chose the latter. after that, tatay's condition started fo rapidly decline. him standing from bed became a difficult task for him, to the point in last march that he became bed ridden. his eyesight getting poorer. his stutter became random words, and from random words to unintelligible murmurs, to nothing. he cannot speak anymore and the only way we devised to communicate is by asking yes/no questions tatay only needs to squeeze our hands. this was the time it hit me. we're slowly losing tatay. i would come to his room, and hold his hands. he's just squeezing my hands in some sort of intervals but i can't figure out what he's trying to say. i can only whisper some comforting words in his ears, thanking him for everything he's done for us, and if he's thinking of the debts he doesn't have to, i reassure him that i will take care of nanay and my siblings, there won't be a time that we'll be hungry. i have to hold back my tears everytime i came to his room and tell those things while holding his hands. i have to show i'm strong enough. but at night i can't help but cry to sleep thinking how can i handle everything, and only my girlfriend knows that i sometimes cry to sleep and that i'm starting to get depressed overthinking. i can't even show my weakness to my family. while the 1 year that doctor told us is coming, i can't help but accept that tatay is slowly dying, a slow and hopefully not a painful one. last month, with us in the room, and with tatay's siblings who coincidentally decided to visit him that day, we lost him. memory is still vivid, of the time we noticed his hands losing it warmth, his deep breathing and coughing, and i have to call his doctor and at the same time an ambulance. but that time, i had an idea that we're losing him, from the end-of-life care pointers that his doctor have told me, those last few hours, i only asked the doctor through call if this is it, she only told us the bring him to the hospital. but on transit, we lost him. the wailing siren got drown out of the cries of nanay and my tita. outside of the er, he was pronounced dead. tatay left us. tatay is now at peace, no sickness, no pain. today, father's day, and also the 40th day of his death. i wish i can greet him and hug him, but that can't. and i hope i know what he's trying to tell me that time i'm holding his hand but he can't utter any word. to tatay, who gave everything for us, who's love will always be for us. i will always dedicate this day for you and celebrate the life we had when we're together. and if you're still reading, this is the sign, call your dad. if you still had the chance to do so, cook something

"Education, Teachers, Students, Online Classes and the Pandemic","the shift to online platforms and distance learning is a totally unexpected shift, but it there is a professional bound to know how to do distance learning it would be education professionals. as these trying times try many of us, we are bound to make mistakes. mistakes are ... well ... missed--takes, wrong takes: slip-ups if you will. they are accidental. you know what should not be accidental? professional outputs. there has been a loooottt of modules errors, some of which are not important like typos and printer errors. what is important is that these modules are professional outputs of professionally licensed proffesionals doing their profession. do expect other professionals to own up to the mistakes of their professional outputs... yes. one of my advocacies is education and uplifting teachers of our notion of ""teacher lang yan"". i've seen a recent viral post saying that (non-verbatim): kayo ngang estudyante hindi nyo gusto na binabanggit ang scores nyo out loud o kaya makipag exchage papers with your classmates for checking - kaya huwag nyo rin gawin sa teachers nyo ito. now there is something subtle about this, that totally drives me nuts: you cannot compare professional outputs from student outputs. we need to be sensitive, students and teachers alike. the key thing is to never forget students are students, not professionals while teachers are professionals - experts of education. if there are professionals who know what to do to keep students learning it should be professionals who studied for years how a child develops, theories on learning, modes of learning, requirements of learning, aspects of learning, and so on. the sad thing here is: students are the ones calling out teachers for grave errors (like some teachers not giving proper instructions, wrong lectures, so on) students should not do that. do you know who should? consider this scenario, who critiques other doctors' prescriptions or diagnosis? co-doctors:: co-specialists. why? because medicine is a hard field that isn't always understood by the layperson or even professionals and experts of other fields. now, let's go back to education. learning is common to all us which is why it is so easy say something about it, but just like thinking is done by everyone and not all people are experts or novices in psychology, just because learning is common doesn't mean people are automatically experts or novices in the field of education. so... between the opinion of a student vs the opinion of a teacher on education, the latter is more understood to come from an expertise. what does this mean? if there is something wrong in the education(modules, outright concepts or lessons, mode of teaching, ehem online is not classroom) it should not be students to first notice them ... who should notice it? experts of education: teachers. education is hard. teachers step up your game. education must continue, but we cannot continue like this. i believe that when it comes to education, teachers know best. i hope teachers stop this non-sense of covering up for each other. you are professionals. for all the teachers i know, that despite the hardship, stand on what they knownis right : to uphold the integrity of instruction and education. for the teachers who are blinded by current culture: di ka teacher lang. you are a professional like all the doctors, engineers, etc. and i believe in you. you have the authority in your field, but you are also accountable for it. if a doctor's wrong prescription can get theirl icense revoked, a miscalculation of an engineer can get their licensed remove, a teacher's wrong move in education can ... you fill in the blanks. a teacher is a professional and at the level of all the professionals. please philippine education please get better. ps: please raise their salaries a teacher of 30 students is keeping an eye out on the learning capabilities, measures, etc of 30 individuals. imagine being an engineer with 30 miniprojects where you get to monitor all the progress of each- headache hahaha. (on that note raise the minimum wage to a livable wage please) edit: if we can have students post their problems here and teachers go ahead and do what you do best: guide, activate, and enhance learning. on the flipside, teachers you can comment you're struggles with your students. let's foster sensitivity not by censoring out struggles, but by caring for each other. 😁",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/jax4vg/education_teachers_students_online_classes_and/,14 10 2020

"Japan Intern experience, tayo nasa lupa pa sila nasa langit na","sorry sa wrong capitalization and english, binilisan ko lang based from exp. as i worked for a factory/manufacturing company as a technical intern trainee. i learned something to be wary about in japan. before i'm deployed as a technical intern trainee, my local agency gave me a hint about not to say inappropriate words even in my thoughts, while in japan, which is to me, a very weird info to remember about. i never think about it that much, up until the following events. everything went smoothly from our schooling for 6months but covid happened so we are forced to wait for 1 and a half year, schooled again for a month up until we departed to japan. we went on a training center in nagoya. there i met fellow trainees which are from different countries as well as trainees same nationality but not from the same agency. it was enjoyable since its our first time to interact with these nationalities and they seem unique in their own way, as well as a new sight to see as someone who doesnt go out often. it was a bit easy since japanese language isnt that troubling for me. it was a trainwreck sometimes since theres a lot of ruckus between races since conflict between cultures are naturally meant to happen. i dont know why but im wary about the japanese, is it because of their image in social media, or is it that im careful on the unknown. knowing all the atrocities they've done in wars, etc., other than that, all i know about them are their contributions through anime, food, etc. after departing from the training center, we moved our baggage in a van, one of our company's representatives said something thats inappropriate, saying ""you can pull down that seat, or you could just sit in the floor like in the philippines."". that was a bit distracting to me. but i just throw it off as some joke thats out of context. when we reached the company dorm , they bought us basic necessities for our daily living there, which we appreciate. on our first day of the job, we are oriented by the line leaders in the factory. went well, and then we are asked to watch and learn for our job. my first job was on a machine called rip cutter, basically, it cut the ends of the rubber. i put the rubber in there, let the machine do its thing, and then they are passed unto the next process which is called breaker. i was thought by the vietnamese, which are good lads btw. up until 2 weeks, i was asked to do it alone, it went badly since i cant achieve the quota yet. there are duties i couldnt attend like cleaning sometimes since time is up for the next shift. i got another week of coaching again, this time a filipino. for me, he thought me better, since there is no language barrier, i can ask him anything i want. i stabilize from thereon onwards. after a whole month, i am transferred to the building next to mine. where i was thought another process, this time all hands on, no machine involved. im cutting the tips of a ropelike rubber evenly. thought by a vietnamese again, took me a week this time. after few weeks of cutting, the palm of my hand start hurting from using a large scissor. i asked my supervising agency in japan to skip work for a day due to this. they asked me to visit a clinic for this inconvenience, which i agreed. got a permission, and they gave me cooling strips for my palm. the next day, it still hurt to the point that i still cant touch anything without a sharp pain in my palm. so i asked the supervising agency again for another dayoff early morning. this time i got reprimanded, maybe due to the short notice. this time i promised i will go to work even with medical emergencies as long as it's tolerable. after getting accustomed to the job, i bought a personal computer for myself. i tohught this would accompany me for the remaining 2years or so. rode a bicycle around aichi prefecture, go to sega and play crane games, asked my upperclassmen to teach us the train system, and go to nearby malls, etc. the following months went smoothly up until one of my friends start to feel unwell on his workplace. his silly attitude changed into a gloomy one. we asked him how was he but he just say hes fine. everyone in our dorm feel that something is wrong. i thought it was a personal problem at first, but i can feel him forcing himself to work so it should be work related. me on the other hand, i just go to work, do what needs to be done, and then go home to relax, because the work is very exhausting for me. the time came when my vietnamese upperclassmen at work are about to go back to their own country since their 5year contract are done. it was that time when they thought me not just the menial work but also the complexities of my work. like proper timing, where to get work related things necessary for the job, and to help on the cleaning of the entire area in my workplace, not just my workstation. they are good upperclassmen, very respectable. but things got suspicious on my last conversation on them before they leave. they said that there would be an exam within the company, that 'i should follow the words i would be hearing around me or from the populace, if i dont understand just get the japanese dictionary and understand the word, and there would be a timelimit on this, the longer i took this exam the more i trouble the people around me, and also, i cant go anywhere outside my city yet, i should follow the process before i could slowly go to the next city or so'. its just too vague for me that time. they also said that 'this will help me understand the world', where i just laughed. i nver took the advice seriously, since i plan to not stay long in japan. all i think about is to enjoy the momment in there, so i went my filipino uppercclassmen to go to osu kannon, nagoya, not heeding the advice of my vietnamese upperclassmen. as i go to these places, everything went well, it was fun going out with the homies. there was an upcoming exam on our 6th month as a trainee, where we are given reviewers and educational videos for our jobs. i studied on the last week before the exam, since it was a bit easy. the exam happened and it went well. the problem is the other exam foreshadowed by my vietnamese upperclassmen who finished their contract. it started at the end of october, where i was given new tasks at work, thought by a coworker, and then i remember that this task was exactly what the vietnamese upperclassman thought me from before but he didnt explain it that clearly that time, because he's in the middle of his job and we just had a small talk. and then, when i went to duty the next day at work, i started hearing looped japanese words around me. i suspect its from the speakers around the workplace. what confirmed my doubt was when they said its an exam and told me what needed to be done. i dont mind it that time, since im used to the job already. they said that you should concentrate during work, dont ask for help or wait for help, time my movements, etc., but the problem on this is that they insult us when me make mistakes. which is fine, since everything went smoothly up until that point, the work should be a challenge since its japan were talking about, they are detail oriented. but what's bugging me is after my work at 5pm, the japanese residents i passed by started saying vague things and say it out of the blue, i dont even speak to the residents that much, yet this time they're the one who spoke to me first, like how im an idiot or unsophisticated. that is when i confirmed its the really the ""test"" the vietnamese upperclassman told me about. i did this so called ""test"", i get what theyre trying to do here, for self improvement and discipline to its trainees. but it went south quickly when the company started asking unreasonable things and do punishments unthinkable to our society today. they hated me for making friends, giving things to people i value, and most of all, they asked me to not joke around or stop being cheerful. like how can i suddenly just stop being me, ma homie?. these values are already instilled into me, and they hate me for that. i receive these instructions when i work in the company or from the residents. what's more mind boggling is how they discipline us if we dont follow or ignore them, there are some kind of device moving inside my body that inflicts pain, cause headaches, coldness in the hands and feet, ifever i ignore or disobey their instructions. the catch here is that these so called discipline from the company also happens to me in my apartment, what more, it disciplines me even in my thoughts, like saying vulgar words. i conclude then, that means there's 24/7 supervision on us while were staying in japan. i noticed it when i experienced their ""way of discipline"" when im playing computergames, joke around with my friends, say something rude, thinking about something obscene, etc. thats the end of the rope for me, i contacted polo tokyo and osaka for this, i received a lot of backlash, from the residents, from the company, got insulted everyday at work, residents started being rude to me. i consider this as a threat, that means they are in control, if they can inflict discomfort from inside of our bodies who knows what else they could do. i broke no rules outside my dorm, but to have this much constraints is just too much. &#x200b; conclusion: japan is a work only zone. you can't say no. you in, you in.

"Ranting in, Venting out. Due to old curriculum dilemma in college and online classes conundrums; Can someone, anyone else relate?","first time posting in general, both subreddit (r/philippines) and this said discussion thread and a long time lurkerer*(lurker)* here too. i'm somewhat also nervous too. *pasensiya na kung mahaba post ko.* i don't want to sound narcissistic and self-pitying but alas, i need to rant and vent it out since at some point i'm having triggers or panic attacks out of nowhere when i sudden think about it. see, nag-stop ako around 2nd semester of 2018 dahil bagsakan ako **(lahat ng subjects iyun, nakakapangluluho sobra)** and i decided to take hiatus. since computer science ang course ko i also intended to learn more about programming but since puro procastination lang, wala rin napala at nang-yari during 3-year hiatus. *at medyo narinig-rinigan ko na rin iyung pag-transition sa newer curriculum although pinalabas ko lang sa kabila kong tenga ko na nagmukha akong tanga, retrospectively.* fast forward to early 2021, i out of nowhere, decided to finish what i left and enrolled and the dilemma starts. may mga subjects na wala na in-offer in which absolute nuisance (3 lectured subjects pa na-iwan and *iyung isa dun sa tatlong iyun currently crossed-enrolled ko iyan*, hindi pa counted or kasama thesis diyan *more on that later* that totaling 6 of them.) but somewhat i do believe in myself na tolerable kahit papano since typically lectures naman iyun at tiyaga-tiyagain na lang iyun in this case online classes as of 2021 but the problem **(my pet peeve, headache and huge pain in the ass!)** is thesis and they were 3 of them by order: *thesis 0 proposal, thesis 1 and thesis 2 practicum* and i'm **extremely humiliated** to say for over **7 years** *(2013 ako nag-start sa college)* that **i still suck at programming up to this day** and the only program that i know to code *is obligatory ""hello world""* not to mention according to my subject adviser may dalawa pang estudyante raw nag-iinquire regarding sa thesis since by this point rendered obsolete na as a old curriculum unless may mag-petition or offered by the same branch. not sure din if ever kailan pa ulit mag-iinquire iyung mga nasabing dalawang mag-thethesis na iyun. and also the problem is wala naman akong contact sa kanila, thats one and another one is meron-din akong **""what-ifs""** kung marunong iyung mga dalawang nag-iinquire sa thesis sa programming, that at some point gumagawa din ako ng **fail-safe** plan para pag-aaralin ko ulit from scratch iyung programming para *in-case ako na mag-take over kung kinakailangan.* and hypothetically, kung may bihasa isa sa kanila, plano ko maging **""document specialist""** since somewhat may knowledge ako sa english and somewhat workable naman ako sa word office program at willing din ako magcooperate, makipag-chat even video call sa kanila kung kinakailangan (since online classes as of 2021). i would be also grateful if may isa pang dumagdag na estudyanteng mag-iinquire kung sakali para apat na kami since *by default, mga groupings ay apat talaga iyan per group.* this also goes towards subjects regarding towards continuing older-curriculum that also rendered as obsolete due to hindi na-inoffer unless kung may nag-offer sa ibang campuses na kapareho dun sa subject/s or better if it just happens to be a student sa colleges at merong silang branches *kinda like ama, sti, informatics, atbp.* at kung walang-wala ka nang option, babayarin mo per-head as a student and thats 15 students (depending on units, typically 3 or 4 iyun ang tuition fee mo) just for the classes or to fulfill your thesis practicum, medyo makakahinga ka kung meron din nakipasok that pwede kayong maghati-hati in condition **wishfully thinking** that hindi kayo babagsak otherwise from thesis mates in which very expensive and mag aaway-away ang buong grupo, ganun ulit gagawin ninyo **making it awfully and absolutely nightmarish in thesis!** *in which still wala akong pera let alone may trabaho since nanay ko nagpapaaral sa akin.* and in my case, still gumagamit parin sila ng landline for inquirements if kailangan mong mag-inquire if available ba iyung mga older subjects! not via cellphone (although some branches i've inquired does it) neither e-mail nor social media accounts. kung sana lang may kahit isa lang malapit ako (at tayo) sa campus mas madali sana makipag-networking para informed at maka-enroll kaagad. this also doesn't help that i'm also a **sore loser** too, puro sunod-sunod na kamalasan dumating sa buhay ko at ni wala pa akong experience sa trabaho **(almost near neet too kung tumambay pa ako nang matagal)**, wala rin akong kaibigan (iyung mga ka-close ko na estudyante nagsipag-graduate na at may mga trabaho na not to mention may mga pera na) at since wala din akong makausap at least kaharap-harapan sa mga kaklase o may mga pinagdadaanan din na ganito kapareho sa dilemmang hinaharap ko (o kayo) at least para maki-relate at may supporta kahit papano **pakiramdam ko parang sobrang isolated ako that medyo nakakawala rin ng sanity at dun din pumapasok iyung panic attacks ko.** ang nanay ko naman nag-papaaral sakin in which i am extremely grateful despite iyung **nakapapangluluho** iyung lahat na binagsakang subjects ko dahil hindi ko rin pinapasukan nung mga araw na iyun, at dahil dun matic' na ako tumutulong sa chores sa bahay, unconditionally, regardless. other issues is online classes in which it was **""blessed-cursed""** thing from my user experience imo and no, wala akong problema regarding sa internet connection since somewhat angat pa naman ako diyan (hindi ako naka mobile data plan, cable based ako other than maintenance) but on how nakastructure iyung online education system nila regarding sa mga handouts/modules which still technically naka-enrolled ako sa older curriculum rendering me, being *out-of-the loop* ako to the point kailangan ko pang humingi sa professor ko or sa mga ka-estudyante ko given hindi ko sila masyado kilala let alone nakakausap o nakilala pa sa personal that somewhat medyo mahiyain at struggling ako sa pag-approach sa kanila; at ang mga activities, task performance pati exams are the same case. just like sa handouts that kailangan ko pa ipa-manual ang pagdeliver ng activities pati exams. on the lighter side, may isang subject akong tinatake from older curriculum and currently naka-cross enroll ako sa malayong campus sa same branch na ino-offer na subject it which makes online classes way beneficial, making this favoring and a huge perk granted na hindi mo na kailangan mag-travel pa nang malayo. **tl;dr** * 1. stopped from attending classes from 2018 2nd semester, due to failing all subjects and i took 3 year hiatus. * 2. i also intended to learn programming during 3 year span hiatus but learned nothing due to procrastinating **hardly.** * 3. enrollment during early 2021, older curriculum subjects (2) not being offered, thesis problems (not being offered) since they were 3 of them *(in order thesis proposal (0), thesis 1 & thesis 2.)* * 4. sucking hard **both at reading codes, coding and making an application** for over span of 7 years *(since 2013 and time will tell)*. * 5. there are 2 students prior to enrollment inquiring for thesis practicum. * 6. **""what-ifs""** if those 2 would-be thesis students/mates know how to code and make a program, *considering fail-safe plan to learn programming from scratch.* * 7. hopefully someone (aside from those 2 students and myself) also inquired at least 1 student at thesis practicum, from 3 of us towards 4, lessening tuition fee and carefully, **by that, wishfully thinking**, not to **fail** otherwise *repeat.* * 8. subjects fallen out of favor because transition towards newer curriculum standards and due to old curriculum, unless same subject offered in campuses/branches or to pay per head for classes in which it's expensive. * 9. i am a **sore loser. a failure. an unlucky person.** * 10. and still extremely grateful that my mother still pays for my tuitions, having educated as of now despite failing all subjects from 2018. * 11. online classes are blessed-cursed *in my user experience.* * 12. given that i'm still technically enrolled at older curriculum, i'm still separated and isolated from students who currently taking newer curriculum subjects, being out-of-the-loop from modules, activities and exams *(see 13 and 14 below)*. * 13. handouts/modules have to be asked towards students despite not knowing them fully let alone talked to personally. * 14. activities, task performances and exams have to be manually given and coordinated towards professors via online. * 15. and currently (as i write this on april 7, 2021) having cross-enrolled a subject at the same campus i go with, and that same branch is far away where i live in, making online classes is **a huge perk.** *ps:kung pwede lang sana, na-averted or na-lessen ko sana tong situasyon na to kung pumasok pa-rin ako maski bagaskan nung 2019 onwards at nag-sipag ako maski bobo ako sa coding o hypothetically wala ako maka-grupo sa thesis, nag-hanap ako sa kaparehong branches.* salamat sa nagbigay oras at nakibasa sa rant-in, vent-out **(rivo)** post ko. sana din may mga naka-relate, may-pinaghuhugutan o may tinamaan dito regardless kung ano kursong pinasok ninyo. and....... malaking ingat sa mga estudyanteng redditors! either nag-aaral pa, may tinatapos pang older curriculum subjects na hindi ino-offer, mga nag-thethesis pa o pa-graduating na! my final message is: *sana malagpasan ko to. same din sa mga nakaka-relate dito.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/mlxy31/ranting_in_venting_out_due_to_old_curriculum/,7 04 2021
Don’t get fooled again! Unmasking two decades of lies about Golden Rice,"whoa! not this again. remember dengvaxia? when the philippines rushed in to get a mass vaccination campaign using sanofi pasteur's new dengue vaccine? first in the world to do that along with brazil. then the controversy started because sanofi later published reports that dengvaxia may cause more severe cases of dengue in some people. this after 700,000 filipino children had already been vaccinated using the drug. a few deaths were reported, but the hysteria that developed out of the scandal led to a backlash against all other forms of vaccination that subsequently led to an alarming rise in measles and hundreds of preventable deaths. so do we really want to be first in the world again? be the early adopters of an unproven food product? so, this article https://grain.org/en/article/6067-don-t-get-fooled-again-unmasking-two-decades-of-lies-about-golden-rice divulges several problems with golden rice: **its provenance, or who really owns golden rice:** >the technology behind the original golden rice (gr1, made with a daffodil gene) was developed and patented in 2000 by the public scientists ingo potrykus and peter beyer. they assigned their rights over the technology to syngenta. syngenta in turn negotiated other licenses from other sources, including monsanto, to make the technology workable and then licensed it back to the inventors for ""humanitarian"" use, under specific terms, in developing countries. >syngenta retains full commercial rights over golden rice, including over improvements of the technology. they also directly own the patent on gr2, a revised golden rice made with a maize gene. but the company has declared that it no longer has interest in marketing the rice itself in developed countries. >after regulatory approvals, the chinese state-owned corporation chemchina bought the vast majority of shares of syngenta in june 2017 for us$43 billion. chemchina bought the remaining shares shortly after and syngenta was de-listed. syngenta is now a private company owned by one shareholder, chemchina. chemchina says it intends to re-list a minority stake in the company in the future. >despite its new chinese ownership, syngenta is still a swiss company. according to its chairman, ren jianxin, the company aims to double in size over the next 5-10 years and grow its seed sales significantly, including through mergers and acquisitions. >syngenta's website states that ""the majority of our global ip is owned by swiss affiliates of syngenta. a transfer of these ip rights to chinese entities is not foreseen."" in the case of golden rice, the affiliate is syngenta seeds ag, assignee and owner of the two main patents respectively. >in 2018, china's larger chemical conglomerate sinochem plans to merge and consolidate with chemchina in what may be a us$120 billion takeover. the new entity would surpass dow-dupont as the world’s largest chemical company. in sum, chemchina owns syngenta which retains the rights to golden rice. a transfer of these rights to other interests is not planned at the moment, but this could change in the future. **its efficacy:** >based on irri’s documents, golden rice contains less than 10% of an equivalent amount of beta-carotene in carrots. as mentioned above, even the us fda took notice of the golden rice’s low beta-carotene content. citing the irri report, the average beta-carotene of golden rice is a measly 1.26 µg/g, which is even lower than the 1.6 µg/g beta-carotene expression of the very first golden rice generation back in the 2000s. >the already meager beta-carotene content in gr2e can also degrade over time, as shown by a study in 2017.[20] only 60% of the beta-carotene content is retained in golden rice after three weeks in storage, and just 13% after 10 weeks. in australia, the network mothers are demystifying genetic engineering (madge) points out that, at this rate of degradation, “75 days after harvest a person would need to eat 31 kg to get the same amount as in a handful of fresh parsley, as vitamin a degrades in storage.” they further state that “one carrot has the same amount of vitamin a found in nearly 4kg of cooked gm golden rice.”[21] perhaps this is the reason why, from being the solution to vad that saves millions of lives in the 2000s, the proponents are now stating that golden rice is “just one among many solutions” to vad. and it brought back the key question - do we really need golden rice to fight vitamin a deficiency? **is it safe to eat?** >for the past two decades, creators and proponents of golden rice have continuously highlighted the project as critical to alleviate widespread vad, a problem in many developing countries. it is true that vitamin a deficiency remains one of the common forms of malnutrition in many poor and developed countries, especially in africa and south-east asia. according to the world health organisation (who), an estimated 250 million preschool children are vitamin-a deficient. poverty and lack of purchasing power are identified as major causes of malnutrition, including vad. these underlying issues will never be addressed by golden rice. >also, there is a very loose categorisation of golden rice and it is seldom clear whether it is classified as drug or food, as it claims to be a solution for vitamin a deficiency (vad). dr. gene nisperos, from the philippines health alliance for democracy (head) and up manila college of medicine, pointed out that the claim of the proponents that golden rice is safe is not backed by in vivo or outside laboratory experiments and cannot pass the rigors of science. some of the studies being presented were based only on literature of individual protein characters. >the direct use and commercialisation of golden rice is hence quite alarming. in february 2009, news broke that the golden rice project had carried out tests at a school in hunan province, china, involving 68 pupils aged from six to eight. twenty-three of the children received the genetically-engineered rice with their school food, although it had never been tested in any feeding studies on adverse effects on health. this triggered a public debate; the issue was about whether it was ethically and medically responsible to conduct such tests on humans without previous animal feeding trials.[11] >the debate ended in 2015, after the american journal of clinical nutrition retracted a scientific paper that claimed to show that genetically-engineered rice serves as an effective vitamin a supplement. this happened after the massachusetts superior court denied the first author's motion for an injunction against the publisher. the study was said to have ethical breaches, with no proof of consent by parents of the children taking part in the trials and faking ethics approval documents.[12] >despite the controversy around direct feeding trials to children, irri and philrice pushed through and further submitted an application for direct feeding trials to the philippines’ department of agriculture-bureau of plant industry, in february 2017. meanwhile, according to a source at brri, feeding trials to children are also planned to take place between 2018 and 2019 in bangladesh, with the help of the hellen keller institute, a partner organisation of the golden rice humanitarian board, once the open field trials are concluded. **other problems** >despite being the first to develop golden rice in the country, in 2017, a group of indian researchers reported that the genes needed to produce golden rice have unintended effects. when they inserted the engineered dna in the high-yielding and agronomically superior indian rice variety, swarma, it became pale and stunted. the yields were so reduced that it was unsuitable for cultivation.[9] and there hasn’t been much progress since for development of golden rice in india. >the delay of the commercialization of golden rice, and the ‘lackluster acceptance’ of the public is due to the inherent flaws and failures of both the technology and the product itself. golden rice is going to be useless and unlikely to achieve its objective of helping to solve vad if its beta-carotene is consistently low, and even prone to degradation. yields have been consistently low, indicating that farmers might suffer economically if they choose to plant golden rice. meanwhile, golden rice will allow corporations to set their foot at the door of our agriculture and introduce more genetically-modified food crops. while these pro-gr groups keep tagging the golden rice detractors as ‘vandals’, they also continue to take for granted the realities of hunger that these farmers and the asian peoples are experiencing on a daily basis. our countries are blessed with bountiful resources to feed our population, but poverty and social inequalities stop people from procuring safe and nutritious food. golden rice will never solve vad and will only strengthen the status quo, benefiting only those interested in controlling our nations’ agricultural sector. >the real crime against humanity is committed by the pro-golden rice camp by peddling a gm product that is not tested nor proven to be safe. in fact, this can turn into a situation where the ‘medicine’ is worse than the illness it intends to cure. >golden rice is a techno-fix to malnutrition and a corporate ploy to control our agriculture. it is not needed by asian people nor the world. indeed, the solution to hunger and malnutrition lies in comprehensive approaches that ensure people have access to diverse sources of nutrition. securing small farmers’ control over resources such as seed, appropriate technologies, water and land is the real key to improving food production and eradicating hunger and malnutrition.while these pro-gr groups keep tagging the golden rice detractors as ‘vandals’, they also continue to take for granted the realities of hunger that

for animal feeding trials and human safety trials to go ahead first before adopting or allowing golden rice to be available in our market. maybe, let other countries go ahead in allowing their people access to golden rice. let them get the early adopter headaches. surely, we don't want another repeat of a dengvaxia incident this

Be careful of what you consume while traveling abroad.,"a good friend stayed in china for 2 weeks to visit his relatives. he was in good shape and ate healthy food, and i can attest he took good care of his body. until he visited shaanxi. he and his relatives frequented different restaurants while he was still there. he was never picky nor had any issues with food. but a bowl of soup from one of the chinese restaurants messed him up really badly. he had intense intestinal pain and could barely do anything due to the cramps he suffered. when at the hospital in china, the doctor asked him if he ate something he was not used to having and he said he’d never had any issues trying different cuisines. for whatever reason, the doctor asked him the last restaurant he had eaten at before the debacle happened. the doctor said the restaurant was suspected of using gutter oil (basically, oil that came from a grease trap) that may have caused his diarrhea. multiple deaths had happened in that place due to the consumption of food that was cooked using gutter oil. edit: i used to work for a restaurant in malate and have collected gutter oil since it was part of my duty as a waiter. every month, we could collect 2-3 buckets, and someone would pick them up and pay around 300 or 400 per container. so, yeah... i never knew what they did with the oil—never wanted to know even—and had never expected that grease that smelled diabolical could be recycled until my friend relayed the gutter oil mishap.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/18fg2eb/be_careful_of_what_you_consume_while_traveling/,10 12 2023
How do you reconcile Body Positivity vs Filipinos neglecting their health?,"judgmental ako - but all in my head. i never body shame anyone. pero pag nasa pila ako sa cashier sa grocery store, i have this weird hobby. i take a look at what the other people's grocery items are in their carts/ baskets. tapos i match the contents of the grocery items with their body figures. take note, this is all in my head. si kuya na nasa kabilang pila, may 2 bottles of coke litro... sa isip ko... no wonder obese si kuya, panay soft drinks ang binibili. si ate na nasa harapan ko, puro chichirya at pancit canton ang nasa basket. tas may malaking bilbil si ate, aakalain mong buntis. sa likuran ko, si ma'am na medyo may edad na... veggies at whole foods ang nasa cart... tiningnan ko sya at kasama nyang family members... they all have healthy body figures (not overweight). sa pila ng grocery store ko na vavalidate ang kasabihan na ""you are what you eat."" lately, i've been noticing pinoys talking about body positivity on social media. i get it - body shaming is tantamount to bullying. it can ruin a person's confidence and can lead to depression. so we need to be mindful of what we say about people's bodies. on the other hand, there's a big lack of health consciousness in filipino culture. that's why most of our food and merienda are sweet ([for those who don't know, sugar is bad for our health](https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/the-sweet-danger-of-sugar)). our breads are sweet compared to that of other cultures. even when the keto diet became a fad in the philippines, i just roll my eyes when people make keto diet an excuse to binge on lechon. like seriously, keto diet only works when you abstain from carbs - precisely the reason why keto diet will generally not work on pinoys simply because, sinong pinoy ang kakilala nyo na hindi kumakain ng rice? eh tatay ko nga naglalagay pa rin ng kanin pag pasta yung dinner eh. hindi ako magugulat kung yung ibang pinoy mag carbs on carbs din basta lang may rice. i don't body shame, pero since health conscious ako, i make it a point to advise my friends because i'm concerned for their health. i have a close friend with a beer belly. pinuna ko, telling him to cut on rice intake and to avoid soft drinks altogether at masanay na lang sa water ang inumin. my friend's dad is currently taking insulin for diabetes and had a stroke. i'm especially wary of this body positivity craze because i feel pinoys will make it an excuse to continue making poor health choices and continue eating unhealthy food. eh diba comorbidities exacerbate things when you get covid-19? so inisip ko dapat lalo maging health conscious mga tao sa panahon ng pandemic. but i don't see this happening. ako lang ba nag-iisip ng ganito about body positivity? can you guys share your perspective about the issue?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/l2m4vd/how_do_you_reconcile_body_positivity_vs_filipinos/,22 01 2021

"Where to Look for Medical Assistance, DAD IS IN VEGETATIVE STATE amidst COVID-19 Pandemic","i'm sorry but i don't know where else to go. so i'm going to give it a try here. please help us, where can we find government assistance or any financial assistance to help is cover hospital bills for my dad? he does not have medical or life insurance. only has philhealth and his senior citizen discount. we are just 3 siblings caring for him, and all of us are barely earning due to the lockdown. our families have tried sending help, but they are also barely surviving so they can't send a lot. please help us, we don't know what else to do. this started in the morning of august 12. we were happily having breakfast and my 70 y.o. dad was about to sit down on the couch and suddenly collapsed. he had already lost his bodily functions by then. we rushed him immediately to many hospitals, but sadly were rejected one after another. we were only able to receive proper treatment in the afternoon at uerm, but they also had full bed capacity. he waited in the er for hours while we searched for a hospital. regrettably, we were only able to get a room in cardinal santos, a very expensive hospital, because it was the only one with an icu ready and it was already 4am. at the time, we prioritized getting my dad admitted without thinking about the possible charges. my dad was diagnosed with aphasic stroke, wherein the dominant part of the left side of his brain was hit by the blood clot. this stopped all comprehensive functions (sight, hearing, talking, and eating). he can slightly move his limbs but only when he feels pain. he is conscious but can only open his eyes, which will only last for a few seconds and he will sleep again. this is because his brain is still swelling due to the blood clot and causes him to feel drowsy. because he can't control his throat muscles, he can't cough out the accumulated mucus in his lungs. we're praying that this will not lead to pneumonia. after 3 days, we finally got him to get transferred to a regular room so we could be with him. but this did not mean he was in a better condition. we could hear his heavy breathing due to phlegm build-up. we were advised to have surgery wherein part of his skull will be removed to allow his swollen brain to breathe, but this would still lead him to become vegetative because of his old age. it will only allow him to stay alive while being attached to a machine. the surgery is also very expensive, minimum fee is at ₱800k and above. we were also asked to intubate him but we also refused because of the risk of his heart stopping. right now, we are fighting for him but we don't want to push him to become alive for our sake at the expense of him suffering even more. that's why we decided to take care of him personally in a regular room, no matter how long it takes. but this required us to take turns watching him, affecting our daily jobs and it is just us 3 siblings who can take care of him. it's just been 4 days now but the bill is already at ₱273k without the 20% senior citizen discount. we've been asking for financial help from our friends and family, but they are not enough especially because we don't know for how long my dad will be staying in the room. if you have any idea where we can ask for help, please let us know. your prayers will also be a big help to my father. thank you so much.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/iamb77/where_to_look_for_medical_assistance_dad_is_in/,16 08 2020

Our COVID story,"so kakatapos lang ng 14 day isolation namin and our lgu declared us covid recovered. i just want to share my experience regarding this. around april 19 my lola started developing a cough that progressed into pneumonia. since she hasn't gone outside since the pandemic started it took a week before our doctor recommended we get her swabbed. she tested positive april 24 and was admitted into a hospital april 27. the rest of our family got swabbed april 28 and the results came back positive for my mom and i. our lgu had us admitted into an isolation facility (15 min drive from our barangay) april 29. we stayed there for 14 days and we are currently back home. regarding our covid symptoms timeline, around the same time lola started coughing napapansin ko na ilang araw akong nahihilo at nag-lbm. nagkasore eyes din ako for a few days. day 3 sa isolation facility nawalan ako ng pang-amoy at sumama nadin yung panlasa ko. losing your sense of smell and taste is weird to say the least. as for my case i did not have any trouble breathing nor did i have a clogged nose, wala ka lang talagang maamoy at ang nalalasahan mo lang ay maalat at matamis, no complex flavors. thankfully, this only lasted for about 3-4 days. also developed a rash but thats about it. my mom developed a fever for a day and started coughing but that was quickly treated. for the facility naman i can't really complain. we stayed in a big hall type building na naka divider per cell(?)/room(?). the place was well ventilated and air conditioned. you get food 3 times a day. pwede ka rin magpadala ng extra food or other items outside from your family and friends so thats a plus. shared yung cr pero malinis naman. the facility itself was like a small subdivision, pwede ka magexercise and walk or jog around the place in the morning and in the afternoon. staff were friendly and helpful too. our whole 14 day stay was free from the accommodation to the food and the medicine. dahil most of us there were mild/asymptomatic and everyone was friendly and helpful hindi naging depressing yung atmosphere and that helped us get through the 2 weeks. sadly, my lola didn't make it and she said goodbye may 8. while my mom and i are thankful that we recovered, nakakalungkot din yung uuwi ka knowing na abo na yung isang tao na naging part ng buhay mo since bata ka. please stay safe guys. get vaccinated if you can. while we were lucky that we got through this, marami din ang hindi. if not for yourself think of those around you. the virus is and was always a big deal, i just hope more people realize that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/nb9os1/our_covid_story/,13 05 2021

"Lost media help: Kaiju-style animated PSA about dehydration and diarrhea, circa 1990-95. Has anyone seen this or somehow own a copy?","as the title implies, back when i was very young and still living in manila there was this weird psa about dehydration and diarrhea that always played on tv. i was only there from 1990-95 and have since moved to portugal with my parents. it’s a funny but fond memory of my time there but i have never seen it since. rough premise: scene of a residential area or suburb with several houses pictured. it was night time when a pair of kaiju (giant monsters much like godzilla or king kong) came waltzing to town. these two monsters were named ‘pagtatae’ (literally means diarrhea) and ‘dehydration.’ diarrhea was stout and brutish, brown-colored and was made entirely of poop, kinda like clayface from batman the animated series except that this one is clearly made of something worse. dehydration was tall and lanky, white with maybe some greens or grays and made of water. diarrhea was voiced like your typical cartoon brute (think bluto) and dehydration spoke in hissy tones like a slimy villain (think gollum). i don’t remember them saying anything other than their names, kinda like pokemon. i don’t remember much else but i think they were defeated at the end, not sure who did it or how it was done. i’m pretty sure it was made by the health department. i’ve looked for clues in the internet, asked my filipino relatives, but sadly no leads. none of them remembers it either maybe because they’re not in the same age bracket as me. i know this is so obscure and a longshot but i hope someone out there had it recorded or something.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/xv60e3/lost_media_help_kaijustyle_animated_psa_about/,4 10 2022
Be careful of what you consume while traveling abroad.,"a good friend stayed in china for 2 weeks to visit his relatives. he was in good shape and ate healthy food, and i can attest he took good care of his body. until he visited shaanxi. he and his relatives frequented different restaurants while he was still there. he was never picky nor had any issues with food. but a bowl of soup from one of the chinese restaurants messed him up really badly. he had intense intestinal pain and could barely do anything due to the cramps he suffered. when at the hospital in china, the doctor asked him if he ate something he was not used to having and he said he’d never had any issues trying different cuisines. for whatever reason, the doctor asked him the last restaurant he had eaten at before the debacle happened. the doctor said the restaurant was suspected of using gutter oil (basically, oil that came from a grease trap) that may have caused his diarrhea. multiple deaths had happened in that place due to the consumption of food that was cooked using gutter oil. edit: i used to work for a restaurant in malate and have collected gutter oil since it was part of my duty as a waiter. every month, we could collect 2-3 buckets, and someone would pick them up and pay around 300 or 400 per container. so, yeah... i never knew what they did with the oil—never wanted to know even—and had never expected that grease that smelled diabolical could be recycled until my friend relayed the gutter oil mishap.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/18fg2eb/be_careful_of_what_you_consume_while_traveling/,10 12 2023

Imaging diagnostic for suspected obstruction in cats?,"hi. let me begin by sharing with you a brief history of my cats medical condition. i have 2 year old cat, her name is bronya (because i love honkai impact). for around a month, she has been experiencing diarrhea and is noticeably lethargic and sometimes even vomit. trying to be a responsible owner i have visited multiple animal clinics in qc for several times to have her treated. luckily, she recovered from her diarrhea but i started to notice her stools become a bit pencil shaped and thin. she also begins to rapidly lose weight and refuses to eat. a cousin from mine who lives abroad who also happens to be a vet suspects that this might have something to do with an obstruction in my cat's gastrointestinal tract and told me that if possible, i bring her to the nearest facility and have this be checked. one clinic i visited told me that she needs to have an x ray of her abdomen, but since their technician wasn't there at the time, i was advised to go back the next day. but when i came back, there was another vet (apparently an associate in the same clinic) who told me that she needs and ultrasound instead? so my question is, what should be used whenever the case is similar to my cat above? does anyone here have the same experience? i really don't want to waste resources as i'm on a budget but i can't let a loved one suffer any longer because of confusion. any feedback is deeply appreciated 😔",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/xqvuz9/imaging_diagnostic_for_suspected_obstruction_in/,29 09 2022

Just diagnosed with HIV,"hi. i (23m) just got diagnosed with hiv. i will still undergo a confirmatory test on wednesday to see if i really do have the virus. i only took 2 rapid antigen tests and they came back positive, and the test kits are highly accurate. when i took my first antigen test on august 20 and got the result, it was a weird feeling. i have been very sickly for almost a year now, and now that i have my results, i finally know why. i just want to get this off my chest. i have already accepted my diagnosis and i'm glad that receiving my diagnosis wasn't so bad as others. maybe it has not sunken it yet? idk. i hope that i'd really come into terms with this chronic illness. what's really bothersome for me is, i am a person with big, big dreams. i have always been looking forward to the future. right now, i am a graduating student practicing physical therapy. the thing is, when i got my diagnosis, i wasn't afraid of how deadly or how potentially life-threatening it is. instead, i was more afraid of how it can potentially impact my life from now on. i've always had a map, a direction of where i wanted to go in my life, but now, idk what to do anymore. i don't know what kinds of opportunities that were just stripped off from me, and i am yet to find out. i definitely know that life is going to be different from now on, and nothing has prepared me for this. i can't even tell my parents about this. from my family, i just told my sister. luckily, treatment is going to be for free and that's convenient so i don't have to rely on my parents. huge shoutout to loveyourself! they have been amazing in delivering their service. it brings me comfort to just see how passionate the people who are working there. as for me, i'm still yet to see. it's going to be a different life from now on. i know i got this, i just have to continue moving forward update: hello, i've read all of your comments! thank you all so much for your affirming words 🙏🏼 i'm very glad na i sparked this discourse and people are getting educated by it! i feel so much better than yesterday when i posted it, it's just amazing na there are understanding people! i would just like to answer some very common questions from the comments: how did you acquire it? - i engage in very risky sexual behaviors. mostly m2m, and i do it unprotected sometimes. mostly oral lahat, wasn't really into penetrative sex. for 3 years, i've mostly engaged in oral sex lang with people i met online and usually ako yung *insertive* sa role. since then, twice lang ako nakapag anal but puro protected. i'm thinking na maybe i got it through oral sex and take note ah na it's rare to acquire it via oral sex. this is a lesson to all! what were your symptoms? - for almost a year, i was very sickly talaga. september last year, i contracted amoebiasis and i didn't get treated for it until january when i was hospitalized due to sever malnutrition and dehydration. they did try to rule out hiv while i was treated, but since i had a primary diagnosis at that time, they didn't bother testing hiv nalang. over those months, onting ulan lang, i'd get sick na. it was every week na i'd get a fever! again, i did not think na it was because of hiv since i contracted amoebiasis at the time. the reason why i delayed my treatment lang was sobrang hirap kumuha ng med cert from my school. plus, i didn't want to make up for any missed activities or exams and at that time it was hell months sa gawain and all. they had to isolate me for 2 weeks kasi i had diarrhea and it was a symptom of covid (i know, pretty messed up yung clinic namin). i know it's very ironic of me, a medical course student, who chose to be sick than getting treated dahil lang sa school works. fast forward to february this year when i was discharged, it seemed like i never really got better. i was still having stomach problems and my oral thrush came back, even after weeks of taking prescription medications for it. i had enlarged lymph nodes around my neck to which my doctor prescribed me with antibiotics and nag shrink din naman yung lymph nodes ko. since feb ang masasabi ko lang na pinaka complaint ko is just the fatigue. i didn't have the energy that i used to have. and i just notice na i'm weaker. maffeel mo talaga na something is wrong sa body mo. that's the best way to describe it. what made you decide to get tested? - it was a message from the universe. may nakita lang ako na ad sa facebook by self care about free testing kits that they give out and get delivered to your doorstep. i ordered mine ng august 13 and dumating yung kit ng august 20 (you decide the date that's most convenient for you cause you have to sign some paperwork before it gets handed to you). i was curious lang din to know my status. how much will the treatment cost? - free. as long as may philhealth insurance ka, it's gonna be for free. don ako sa loveyourself sa shaw boulevard pumunta. but, some testing procedures are not going to be for free. i will update on this soon since i will be going back to the doctor ng wednesday. but treatment is generally for free",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/162t88p/just_diagnosed_with_hiv/,27 08 2023

(5) no one even bothered to tell me how ct scan is done. i asked multiple nurses and parang ultrasound lang daw, ""uncomfy"" lang daw. claustrophobic po ako, at sobrang nginig at takot ko nung nandun na ko feeling ko mahihimatay na ko sa kaba. then i asked how is mrcp/ercp done, same as ct scan lang daw. 🙃 (6) i'm ready to die-- in fact, i'd rather die than do the test again. i asked her what are my other options. do the test lang daw. she wouldn't give me a fit to work dahil hindi nya daw po iririsk yung medical license nya giving ftw to someone na hindi naman talaga fit to work 🥴 kahit pumirma pa daw ako ng waiver. im not sure but i think mrsp cost around 20k+, kasi yung ct scan sakin is 25k already. i told her wala po talaga akong pera pang test, her answer is ""its not my problem anymore"". i asked help from my 2 other doctors at baka sila na pwede mag sign, no. si doc gastro daw kasi main physician ko so sakanya daw talaga dapat. help, i respect naman po her decisions pero tama po ba na kahit ayaw na ng patient, kahil alam na ng patient yung risk and ayaw talagang ituloy, need po ba talaga sumunod sa gusto ni doc magpatest and possible surgery? hindi po ako makabalik sa work ko kasi need yung documents. tinry na kausapin ng company doctor namin si gastro specialist, and same lang din sinasabi. i dont know much about medical and legal field. so i'd appreciate any help. asking for legal advice kasi baka this is something na pwede ilaban lol. kung hindi, edi wag. wag na tayo pastress. =========== tldr; kelangan ko ng signed medical documents para makabalik sa work, pero ayaw i-sign ng main doctor ko kasi hindi ko nasunod yung gusto nya na magpa-test pa. 💸 =========== thanks in advance. p.s. sabi ni doc bawal ako mastress at mapagod, pero bakit naman ganito sya mismo nagpapastress at papagod sakin magpabalik balik ng hospital 😵 & andami pa po nila kabalastugan for the whole duration of my stay (ex. they asked me to fast 48hrs for ct scan, yes 48) pero sobrang haba na para ichika ko pa lahat dito. gusto ko lang naman po bumalik na sa work...",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/kzvmoj/need_medicallegal_advice_doctor_refused_to_sign/,18 01 2021
How did growing up in a toxic Pinoy family F you up as a person?,"warning: ed, verbal abuse, child abuse my grandparents are just as toxic as my parents. my mom and dad are a couple of spineless cowards. takot rin sila sa lolo't lola ko, kaya hindi nila kami ipinagtatanggol pag ""dinidisiplina"" kami. i am the first of three siblings and the only female. our family lived in our ancestral home because my mother was my lolo and lola's favorite daughter. growing up in the 90s, my lolo and lola always found food and mealtime as the best means to punish me with. at around four years old to 8, talagang may kahinaan ako kumain. my lolo would always be the one to serve me food. sa akin niya lang ito ginagawa. every time ang dami niyang ilalagay sa plato ko na combination of kanin mixed with whatever viand we're having na halos an inch a way na lang from the edge of the plate sa sobrang dami. as in, itsura pa lang, nalulunod na ako. he would sit across me from the dining table and watch me like a hawk during meal time. he would remind me ever so often to take a bite. ""putang ina. wag mo tungangaan yan. sumubo ka!"", ""wag mo susuhin 'yang pagkain mo! lulunin mo yan!"", ""ano? kakain ka, o isusubsob kita sa pagkain mo na parang aso?"" some nights, nagwawala siya pag di ako makalampas sa tatlong subo. may isang beses na pinagbabasag niya yung plato ko't baso habang nagsisisigaw. tumigil rin kumain yung buong pamilya kasi nalagyan ng mga bubog yung pagkain namin. i remember crying myself to sleep that night nang hindi na nakapaligo pa sa sobrang takot. whenever i cannot finish my meal which is almost every meal, every day, paparusahan ako. the parusa can range from having rights, privileges and my favorite things taken from me. from no tv especially on weekends, my fave books get taken away as well as my toys bawal ko rin hawakan at kalaruin yung aso namin kung di, papaluin ng lolo ko yung aso para pati daw yung alaga ko ""magtanda"". (anong kinalaman nung aso sa di ko pagkain? bakit siya dapat magtanda!?) sometimes my fave toy at the moment gets placed in the middle of the dining table and i only get to touch it if i finish my meal. since hindi ko nga kaya , i usually just bid these toys goodbye. (yung isa kong polly pocket, nakuha ko na at 12 ish years old. na-outgrow ko na siya.) so, to remedy this i worked on being able to eat. then, i gained weight around my pre-teens given the amount of rice i was supposed to finish daily, my lola started taking over out of the blue. all she did was bully me whenever we're eating. especially pag may ibang tao like if we have guests or we're eating out. she would yell things at me. stuff like :""non-stop talaga yang bunganga mong putang ina ka noh? kaya ka lumolobo eh."" one time my uncle winced and called her out when he heard her say ""anlaki-laki ng ng tiyan mo, panay saksak mo pa rin ng pagkain sa muka mong tang ina ka."" when we were out sa grocery, she woud shame me sa mga sales people and sa cashier telling them na. ""lahat 'yan para dito lang sa elepante ko."" or when i would pick an item for myself she would scream out loud for other shoppers to hear na: ""sige! lamon! ang galing galing mo talaga pag dating sa pagpili ng lalamunin mo!"" and she would do this angrily. hindi passive agressive. as in galit at pasigaw. kaya super nakakahiya. when she's in a subtle mood. she would mockingly immitate the way i chew and would laugh calling me: "" babuy!"" or would sarcastically comment on my appearance pag halimbawa naka-ayos ako ""ganda mo, para kang palanggana."" she would also deny me of food at times. say for example she buys a box of donuts, ako lang ang di pwede kumuha. and at times, would accuse me of stealing food or treats at home only to find out na ang kumuha ay either of my brothers. my brothers would deliberately shield me and even so. sasabihin niya na tinakot ko daw yu g mga kapatid ko kaya pinagtatakpan ako. because of this, my brothers learned na magpaalam even for just a handful of m&ms para wag nila ako makitang pinagtitripan ng lola ko. and because i was just so over this treatment, nag diet naman ako. hindi ko namalayan na sumosobra na pala. it didn't help na in the 2000s the pro-ana-mia movement was in full swing. and the media was advocating for thinnes overall. the fashions at the time also favored slim frames. sick as it may seem, i found refuge in bingeing and purging. nakakain ko lahat ng gusto ko without having to gain weight. i also felt that i looked great in the latest trends at that time. i got hospitalized in 2007 for contracting a fatal gastrointentional infection which almost took me out because i was too weak to fight it. violent stomach upsets ba naman at vomitting and diarrhea ang primary symptoms. i weighed only 85lbs at 5ft. 3"". if it weren't for this infection, i wouldn't have been diagnosed with bulimia. it took a nutritionist, our family gastroenteroligist and my first psychiatrist and a couple of female professors na parang mommy figure ko sa school to help get me back to a healthy 115 lbs. i tried to work hard with them to get my life back. pero sa bahay, everything i went through was treated as nothing more than a physiological issue. walang may gusto mag address nung trauma which caused it all. they say, that's my psych's job. yung mommy ko naman, sinasabi niya na hindi niya maalala yung mga kinuwento ko sa inyo dito kanina. but she was always there when this happened. my brothers remember it too! mas naiiyak ako rito pag naiisip ko keysa sa mga pinagsasasabi sa akin ng lolo at lola ko. like, how can mom not remember? yun ba ang trauma response niya? selective amnesia? dahil ba hindi niya kakayanin kung di lilimutin ng utak niya as a form of defense? idk, pero parang mas nasasaktan ako doon. i feel so betrayed. in my 20's i got myself a career one na super minahal ko, pero sucked the soul out of me kasi very competitive and demanding. that time, i got back into bingeing and stopped seeing my psychiatrist and nutritionist all together. kasi, ako na ang magbabayad sa kanila eh. that time though, hindi na ako nagpupurge. i buried myself in work and sweets. before i know it i was gaining weight again. each time i get stressed, i will take my anger and frustration out on a whole cake, a tub of ice cream or makikipag inuman ako pero ang chaser ko 1.5 na coke at sa akin lang yun. donuts held a special place in my heart. kada may magbubukas na bagong donut shop, you can expect to see me falling in line to get a box! i also had candy in my pockets too. all. the. time! expensive candy or cheap candy is just the same to me. basta candy. i remember my psych said that my obsession with it had something to do with candy being the instrument my lola used as a ""trap"" nung bata ako. now, i am just all too happy na i wouldn't get in trouble for being able to access it as an adult. it didn't come as a surprise sa akin na lumobo ako, this time 3x from when i first gained weight as a preteen. i am full-on obese. where was my lolo and lola? nasa bahay pa rin. so, what i did to avoid them was that i left for work early and leave very late at night. i would even just chill with my boyfriend on weekends wag lang ako matambay sa bahay. from then on, i just lived every day as an obese woman. lahat ng milestones ko in life, i achieved as a fat woman. hindi sa proud ako. that's just what i am. severely depressed and fat -- but somehow unstoppable ma-achieve ang work goals ko. then, i had a very bad, unexpected mental breakdown in 2013. kaya i decided to see a new psychiatrist. i was then diagnosed with ptsd and my chronic depression was due to a hormonal imbalance pala. i got treated for the depression and ptsd. pero hirap ako maging physiologically healthy through food. no matter how much media i consume about living and eating healthy i can't seem to get it right. in 2017, i had a major fight with my lolo and finally ibinulalas ko na lahat ng hinanakit ko. pinagmumumura ko siya, at sinabihan rin ng masasakit na salita. i almost physically assaulted him, pero napigilan ako ng kapatid ko. he knew na siguradong mapapahamak ako if i were to lay a hand on my dirtbag of a lolo. jut imagine my obese ass hitting an 80 year old man. i knew that was the end of my stay at that house. lumayas ako nang walang pagdadalawang-isip and lived with my boyfriend just a month before our wedding. my brother helped me pack at siya ang naghatid sa akin. i never returned home. (my brothers were also theorizing na my lolo deliberately planned on riling me up para mag clash kami because i was about to have a big life event and he just felt like pissing on it. just like how all of a sudden, bigla siyang nagwala bago yung debut ko dati. one of my brothers also thought that kaya sa akin pinaka galit yung grandparents namin ay dahil daw, naging kaagaw nila ako sa attention ng mommy ko / anak nila mula nang ipanganak ako. yun ang sabi nila. ako? ewan ko! talagang hindi ko na lang siya kaya pagtimpian. all i feel is rage and contempt.) i saw my lolo again during my lola's funeral. she died 5 months after ko maglayas. namatay siya nang di kami nag uusap at galit ako sa kanya. when i heard the news i was the only one who had a hard time weeping for her. ff to now? i am living life in my mid 30s with maintenance meds for hypertension, borderline diabetis and chronic depression. but, there is a silver lining. i married a kind, understanding and gentle husband na hindi ako nagsasawang paalalahanan na walang parusa na naka abang sa akin pag hindi ko naubos ang pagkain ko. at, hindi ko na kailangan kainin ang feelings ko, dahil nandito siya para pakinggan ako nang walang paghuhusga. i have had so many doctors try to help me, but i believe that it is only he who is actually healing my inner child little by litte.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/10ijk65/how_did_growing_up_in_a_toxic_pinoy_family_f_you/,22 01 2023

Yet no further cases here.,"by now, the australian case is quite well known but here it is anyways https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/news/pages/20200304_06.aspx confirmed case, woman in her 60s who arrived back in australia on march 3, is believed to have returned from the philippines. her travel details are being obtained and will be disclosed if she posed a risk to any other passengers on her flight. taiwan case disclosed last night https://www.cdc.gov.tw/en/bulletin/detail/e2thdyns-cy3xcjy0ebd4q?typeid=158 case #44 is an over-30-year-old male who resides in northern taiwan. he traveled to the philippines with his friends from february 28 to march 3. he had diarrhea in the philippines on march 2. after he returned to taiwan, case #44 went to a clinic due to having a dry throat and tiredness on march 3. he went to a hospital and was reported as a suspected case on march 4. infection with covid-19 was laboratory-confirmed in the case on march 5. related investigation suggested it is an imported case linked to the philippines. please note, i have written ph ""may have"" exported. i am not able to definitively say both cases originated here. they could have gotten it from another traveller on flights sure, but it is likely that those people either caught the disease in the philippines, or have since spread the disease to others in the philippines. ph needs more proactive testing / examination of pneumonia cases, as well as a strategy to test the asymptomatic cases. there are definitely cases here that simply are not getting caught and tested. be careful all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/fe2pai/according_to_2_cases_australia_and_taiwan_ph_may/,5 03 2020
Why doesn’t the survey reflect what’s happening?,"most people are trained to think logically and rely heavily on scientific evidence that we now describe what’s happening in the survey results and sorties as a paradox. still a very conservative way to think right? we wouldn’t want to cry out baseless accusations for fear of seeming uneducated or illogical or emotional would we now? okay so let’s ask questions then and examine what’s before us. first, the percentage of voter preference for marcos jr. it’s more than the majority and even described as unprecedented. no candidate has ever gotten that much voter preference. the tainted past of this candidate regardless of his strong misinformation network is already suspicious, 60% voter preference is not realistic. strong misinformation network notwithstanding. let’s circle back to that later. granted that the disinformation network has been working since 2016 to revise and erase the rottenness of the marcos era the question is where are those informed enough to know what really happened? quickly, in the facts first podcast a professor has studied the misinformation in social media and its role in this election; and she has said that as early as 2016, soon as marcos jr lost there were already youtube channels churning out false information favoring him. so back to the question where are these anti marcos folks? a) were they swayed by the revisionism? b) there were so few of those people to begin with that the disinformation has really taken hold c) is the anger and disappointment towards the pnoy administration so strong that they would be swayed there’s a sub question under letter c. wouldn’t these people think yeah, pnoy’s admin might’ve been flawed but isn’t the marcos admin much worse? so why go back to a system that’s even more broken? if surveys were a snapshot of a given time period shouldn’t certain events in that time frame affect the surveys? a veteran political strategist alan german, said that marcos jr’s refusal to attend debates negatively affected him. he also said that it was a considerable backlash as they had a qss - quick sentiment scan done on social media. he was asked if this was an echo chamber and said that no because it was done on accounts not associated with their camp. how come the surveys didn’t reflect this? also the tax evasion case against him was highlighted again. one would ask, are the majority of the filipinos so blinded and fooled that they wouldn’t take these into account? regarding the surveys themselves. let’s just say this out in the open. and this is not widely asked even. who’s commisioning them? the manpower involved has to be paid. and these surveys are not used for studies. these surveys are used as a pr tool. so let’s take note of that as well. aside from that elephant in the room question, these are itemized questions and observation surveys may say that sample selection is random but we also need to know about how the data was gathered in terms of the interview itself; or how the data gatherers conducted the survey. questions like 1. are they properly trained did they conduct the interview in a professand neutral tone of voice for example as an aside, there are survey questionnaires that have a certain amount attach to them meaning each questionnaire filled out would mean an interviewer would be paid. also there are anecdotal reports of interviewrs filling out the surveys themselves ( due to tiredness etc.) 2. control mechanisms implemented to ensure accuracy of the protocols in data collection; (criterion # 2 was taken from a statement released by the up school of statistics in response to survey legitimacy and kalye surveys.) as far as i know these surveys don’t discuss this in their survey report we can safely say that these are blind spots for all of us who refer to surveys. i think these questions/observations are moot if the survey is just a pr tool commissioned by a “confidential client” that can not be disclosed by the survey firm. so here it is. when the numbers are not adding up we usually don’t trust what our eyes are telling us and we conservatively give preference to the scientific data. but isn’t there also a saying about how the simplest answer is the correct answer. how about the idea that the numbers are not consistent with what we are seeing and feeling simply because they are lying. let’s just go back to the voter preference mentioned earlier, it seems more likely now that it’s another tactic. one, for those voters who tend to vote for a likely winner / bandwagon effect. and to layout the groundwork that this candidate is the clear winner for when they lose and stage a protest. remember if they use misinformation and propaganda isn’t the survey another propaganda tool to be misused? just look at the history of fraud and depth of deception done by these people and tell me that survey manipulation is a stretch.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/t7tqwj/why_doesnt_the_survey_reflect_whats_happening/,6 03 2022

2022 Elections - Your thoughts?,what are your thoughts in the upcoming 2022 elections? here's mine. 1. pdp-laban would have an advantage in new normal election campaign because it already has the strong infrastructure for it (aka troll army). 2. leni robredo will most likely run. but it will be a hard campaign for her. 3. a third party will most likely win the presidency. a candidate that is not under the yellow or red banners due to partisan fatigue. 4. bongbong marcos is more likely to run as president than sara duterte. who would you vote by the way?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/m6vzq6/2022_elections_your_thoughts/,17 03 2021
Just diagnosed with HIV,"hi. i (23m) just got diagnosed with hiv. i will still undergo a confirmatory test on wednesday to see if i really do have the virus. i only took 2 rapid antigen tests and they came back positive, and the test kits are highly accurate. when i took my first antigen test on august 20 and got the result, it was a weird feeling. i have been very sickly for almost a year now, and now that i have my results, i finally know why. i just want to get this off my chest. i have already accepted my diagnosis and i'm glad that receiving my diagnosis wasn't so bad as others. maybe it has not sunken it yet? idk. i hope that i'd really come into terms with this chronic illness. what's really bothersome for me is, i am a person with big, big dreams. i have always been looking forward to the future. right now, i am a graduating student practicing physical therapy. the thing is, when i got my diagnosis, i wasn't afraid of how deadly or how potentially life-threatening it is. instead, i was more afraid of how it can potentially impact my life from now on. i've always had a map, a direction of where i wanted to go in my life, but now, idk what to do anymore. i don't know what kinds of opportunities that were just stripped off from me, and i am yet to find out. i definitely know that life is going to be different from now on, and nothing has prepared me for this. i can't even tell my parents about this. from my family, i just told my sister. luckily, treatment is going to be for free and that's convenient so i don't have to rely on my parents. huge shoutout to loveyourself! they have been amazing in delivering their service. it brings me comfort to just see how passionate the people who are working there. as for me, i'm still yet to see. it's going to be a different life from now on. i know i got this, i just have to continue moving forward update: hello, i've read all of your comments! thank you all so much for your affirming words 🙏🏼 i'm very glad na i sparked this discourse and people are getting educated by it! i feel so much better than yesterday when i posted it, it's just amazing na there are understanding people! i would just like to answer some very common questions from the comments: how did you acquire it? - i engage in very risky sexual behaviors. mostly m2m, and i do it unprotected sometimes. mostly oral lahat, wasn't really into penetrative sex. for 3 years, i've mostly engaged in oral sex lang with people i met online and usually ako yung *insertive* sa role. since then, twice lang ako nakapag anal but puro protected. i'm thinking na maybe i got it through oral sex and take note ah na it's rare to acquire it via oral sex. this is a lesson to all! what were your symptoms? - for almost a year, i was very sickly talaga. september last year, i contracted amoebiasis and i didn't get treated for it until january when i was hospitalized due to sever malnutrition and dehydration. they did try to rule out hiv while i was treated, but since i had a primary diagnosis at that time, they didn't bother testing hiv nalang. over those months, onting ulan lang, i'd get sick na. it was every week na i'd get a fever! again, i did not think na it was because of hiv since i contracted amoebiasis at the time. the reason why i delayed my treatment lang was sobrang hirap kumuha ng med cert from my school. plus, i didn't want to make up for any missed activities or exams and at that time it was hell months sa gawain and all. they had to isolate me for 2 weeks kasi i had diarrhea and it was a symptom of covid (i know, pretty messed up yung clinic namin). i know it's very ironic of me, a medical course student, who chose to be sick than getting treated dahil lang sa school works. fast forward to february this year when i was discharged, it seemed like i never really got better. i was still having stomach problems and my oral thrush came back, even after weeks of taking prescription medications for it. i had enlarged lymph nodes around my neck to which my doctor prescribed me with antibiotics and nag shrink din naman yung lymph nodes ko. since feb ang masasabi ko lang na pinaka complaint ko is just the fatigue. i didn't have the energy that i used to have. and i just notice na i'm weaker. maffeel mo talaga na something is wrong sa body mo. that's the best way to describe it. what made you decide to get tested? - it was a message from the universe. may nakita lang ako na ad sa facebook by self care about free testing kits that they give out and get delivered to your doorstep. i ordered mine ng august 13 and dumating yung kit ng august 20 (you decide the date that's most convenient for you cause you have to sign some paperwork before it gets handed to you). i was curious lang din to know my status. how much will the treatment cost? - free. as long as may philhealth insurance ka, it's gonna be for free. don ako sa loveyourself sa shaw boulevard pumunta. but, some testing procedures are not going to be for free. i will update on this soon since i will be going back to the doctor ng wednesday. but treatment is generally for free",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/162t88p/just_diagnosed_with_hiv/,27 08 2023

"Did I get Covid & just recovered very quickly, or just another flu?","just curious if anyone’s also experienced this, especially since there’s a mini-surge in people getting sick in manila. i know so many people who got covid-symptoms yet tested negative in their antigen tests. my sister got exposed to someone with covid symptoms. day 2 after exposure, they notified us of their symptoms, and in day 3 we also started feeling sick. i already got covid before and i had a hunch it’s covid again since the symptoms felt all-too-familiar (but this time, milder). my sister took an antigen on day 3 and she tested negative. her friends who were also sick also bore negative antigen results. i took an antigen test on day 4 and i also tested negative. however, i also took an rt-pcr test the next day (day 5) to be sure (which also showed negative results). i already feel much better at day 5, but it got me thinking if we really got covid or not? because all the symptoms i felt when i got infected 4 months ago were exactly the same (headache, fatigue, sore throat, cough, runny & clogged nose, fever), except milder (didn’t get a fever this time). i also immediately took medicine for covid on day 3 when i felt the symptoms (so that might be a factor as well to the decreased symptoms & fast recovery?) or maybe a new milder covid strain? or a new flu",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/zrucf4/did_i_get_covid_just_recovered_very_quickly_or/,21 12 2022

(very apt today with rotc to be forced down students' throats again soon) kamasupra? poorman’s grave? buddy singing ‘tama ka’ with an intro about beginning to like the song as he got older (implying that he hated it before) was superb. everysong where raimund was lead vocals was included. paru-parong ningning! slo mo! and he was visibly having fun singing each of them. \--but probably as trade-off, other hits were skipped. no more time for kailan, harana. would have loved to hear as well tindahan ni aling nena, blue jeans, tuwing umuulan… and any one of the no royalty fillers. the eheads was the first band confident and hardheaded enough to have senseless 'ganjazz 'and zappa rant as official tracks; would have been perfect to do one in this concert. but no one gets all their wishes. \--ely was earnest. i watched pupil live several years back in a bar, and i’m pretty sure he was phoning it in then. he was eager to do his best singing here from the get-go. \--superb backup (or true main?) musicians. at several points, you know that the rhythms and leads (much of the load, really) were not being strummed by the band anymore. there were also miscues and missteps throughout, even in the middle of a song, but audrey dionisio and mikey amistoso were saving all of them. and mad, mad respect for jazz nicolas who was doing keyboards, triangles… might even have a cowbell somewhere there. and he was truly elated playing in the ‘gig,’ from beginning to end! \--i like the eksena where raimund stood up from his drums during pare ko and just roamed around the stage, shooting with a gopro, while holding in his other hand a glass of red wine. one can interpret this as the other alpha male of the group egotistically prancing about, or simply someone wanting to drink during a multi-million concert, in the middle of a song, and actually doing it. ely tugged him to sing a line of pare ko. he did. \--all of us are aware of the issue with marcus adoro. there are people who are defending and emphasizing on the independence of art from the artist. there are also parties saying that the exchange posted by his daughter is between a daughter and a father, that bottom line that’s marcus’s way of ‘talking’ to his daughter. this is clearly wrong. to say that there’s no anguish caused by marcus’s words is plain wrong. \--what i’m looking for though is whether or not marcus continued supporting his daughter. there’s no info here. if he’s not supporting, i surely would have skipped this or joined the chorus of removing him from the event. \--i thought marcus will sing panahon, as he rehearsed. but he just inconspicuously occupied his far side of the stage throughout, and remained the one bandmember who did not have a solo. and the monitors were just scatteringly focusing on him. \--i entered college when eraserheads was already very popular, but they were still playing sunken garden at very cheap (or free!) prices. they were also joining our rallies and strumming a tune or two in the mob. they were never greedy. if they need the retirement money right now, they all deserve to get the dough. \--people are also harping now about the moneygrab that is the upcoming world tour. of course it’s going to be a moneygrab. why not maximize the rehearsals and all the preps you spent months for? and again, they were not one of those fabulously-living stars even during their heyday. it’s time for the band to secure retirement money. \--a friend was warning hard about the disorganized mess that happened just a few days before, in a ben&ben concert. this one was relatively organized. the gates separated and there were plenty of ticket attendants at each entrance. (you can see how far even the ‘gold’ section was just from walking between gates). there’s just an unavoidable horde at the end leaving the venue. i can imagine cars trying to get out of a jam (caused by throngs spilling out of pavements) for hours. i parked at okada, walked back after the concert, and took naiax, did not encounter any gridlock going back to qc. \--prices were falling on the day of the concert. i already got three platinum (later shared to college friends) comped from a supplier. bought three from here at reddit at 60% off sticker (all these tickets were zero cost as printed, sponsor-comped at seller side). a colleague bought two more from facebook marketplace (later shared to clients). a seller was offering me 5k for moshpit two hours before the concert. (another friend got two moshpits bought for 15k total 24hrs before). this discounting is always probable to happen in big, open grounds concerts. \--i watched in vip, because i thought the moshpit was going to be a true narrow cramped moshpit where people stagedive. but it was a wide swath with free spaces, instead. diagrams in posters were vastly inaccurate. \--audience were from all age groups. i’m surprised to see 20-somethings knowing the lyrics better than me (late 30’s). \--i still feel the fatigue from all the standing, jumping, swaying a day after, but it’s mostly happy memories. **if you are overseas and they are touring near you, grab the chance.** i hope they do one more in mnl next year. there was magic in listening to music you have skipped for decades (because of overplaying them at their peak). you get to appreciate again the lyrics that are unpretentious and representative of a generation’s angsts. i want to experience again moments where every single one around me were singing to many songs. all imploring: “puwede bang itigil muna ang pag-ikot ng mundo?”... priceless.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/zwnumx/eraserheads_huling_el_bimbo_concert_personal_notes/,27 12 2022

pinagsusuntok niya ako pero tinanggap ko ang lahat hanggang sa mawala ang galit niya. mga six months din bago ko nakita 'yung picture sa phone ko. inabot din kasi ng six months bago natanggal ang cast sa mga braso at binti ko. &#x200b; pagtingin ko sa picture na kinuha ko (kinuha ng girlfriend ko 'yung cellphone ko at itinago pero nakita ko rin naman sa closet niya noong makalabas ako sa ospital), naguluhan ako sa nakita ko. sa larawan, nakatingin ako sa camera at nakangiti. sa tabi ko, may isang matandang babae ang nakaupo. kulubot na ang kanyang mga mukha at kulay abo na ang mga buhok. suot-suot niya ang favorite t-shirt ng nobya ko. &#x200b; napailing na lang ako sa nakita ko. bilib na bilib pa naman ako sa camera ng iphone pero mukhang nagma-malfunction din pala ito. kaya ngayon, samsung na ang telepono ko. hindi ko na rin kinuhanan pa ng litrato ang girlfriend ko. &#x200b; rule #4. huwag magpapakita ng kabaitan sa ibang mga babae. ops! baka isipin niyo na selosa at mahigpit ang girlfriend ko. naku, diyan po kayo nagkakamali. sa katunayan, ayos lang sa kanya na makipagkaibigan ako sa mga babae. hindi siya nagagalit o nagtatampo. naalala ko nga noon, mayroon akong naging kaibigang babae sa trabaho, si carla. siyempre, tayong mga lalaki, natural na friendly tayo sa mga kababaihan. accomodating tayo at mahilig magbiro at mag-joke. madalas tuloy ay pinaghihinalaan tayo ng ating mga girlfriends. pero, iba ang girlfriend ko. ayos lang sa kanya ang ganoon. kahit nakikita niyang magkasama kami ni carla at nagtatawanan kapag bumibisita siya sa office, hindi siya nagagalit. nakakalungkot nga lang na hindi na natin kapiling si carla ngayon. natagpuan na lang siya isang umaga sa kuwarto niya, patay na. noong bumisita ako sa burol niya, nasabi sa akin ng kapatid niya na na-overdose daw sa gamot si carla. pagpasok daw nila sa kuwarto niya, nakita nila si carla na nakahiga sa kama, bumubula ang bibig. sa tabi niya, maraming nagkalat na gamot. puro tusok din ng karayom ang buong katawan niya. marahil daw, dahil sa depresyon o anumang mental illness, tinusok-tusok ni carla ang sarili niya ng karayom at pagkatapos ay uminom ng maraming gamot. ang nakapagtataka lamang daw, wala silang nakitang anumang karayom sa kuwarto ni carla. &#x200b; gaya nga ng sabi ko, hindi selosa ang girlfriend ko. marami akong mga naging kaibigang babae. nandyan si cherry na dating classmate ko noong college. marahil ay nakita mo siya sa balita. isang gabi kasi, habang papauwi galing trabaho, may tumulak daw sa kanya kaya nasagasaan siya ng isang bus. naging close ko rin si june at si barbie. kaso lang, maaga silang kinuha ni lord. bigla na lang silang na-comatose at hindi na nagising. over-fatigued daw sabi ng mga doktor. &#x200b; inaasar nga ako ng mga kaibigan ko ngayon na under daw ako ng girlfriend ko kaya hindi ako nakikipagkaibigan sa mga babae. pero ayos lang naman sa akin. mas masaya akong tawaging under kaysa naman magkaroon ng mga babaeng kaibigan pagkatapos... &#x200b; rule #5. kapag nagising ka sa madaling araw at nakita si girlfriend na naghahanap ng pagkain at mukhang gutom na gutom, magtago sa closet o kaya'y tumalon sa bintana. nakakatawa itong experience na ito. bakit ba ang mga babae, laging gutom? tapos, kapag pinakain mo masaya na kaagad sila? &#x200b; nagising ako isang beses mga alas-tres 'yata iyon. may narinig kasi akong mga kalampag kaya bumangon ako. wala rin kasi si girlfriend sa tabi ko. sa kusina ko siya nakita, hinahalughog ang ref namin. kaso, hindi pa kami nakakapag-grocery dahil wala pang sahod. &#x200b; tiningnan niya ako, nakakunot ang noo niya. ""gutom na ako,"" sabi niya. kahit gutom, sobrang ganda pa rin niya. kaya hindi ko napansin na tumutulo na pala ang laway niya. &#x200b; siyempre, ayokong nagugutom ang girlfriend ko kaya agad akong tumawag para magpa-deliver. pero, hindi na nakapagpigil pa ang girlfriend ko. sobrang gutom na siya, eh. kaya, ayun! &#x200b; pagkatapos niyang kumain, sobrang saya na niya. &#x200b; anyways, naging maayos naman ang lahat. ngayon, alam ko na ang gagawin kapag nakita siyang ganoon kaya wala naman na kaming naging problema pa. at saka, pwede namang mabuhay na isa lang ang kidney mo, hindi ba? basta't sisiguraduhin ko lang na hindi na ito mauulit pa. nag-iisa na lang ang natitira, eh. &#x200b; oh, napakadali lamang namang tandaan, 'di ba? 'yung ibang girlfriend diyan, napaka-demanding, ang dami-daming gusto, ang dami-daming ayaw. pero girlfriend ko, simple lang. simple pero perfect. kaya napakasaya ko sa kanya, eh. hindi ko na siya papakawalan. at siguradong-sigurado ako na hinding-hindi na niya ako papakawalan. &#x200b; edit: sa mga nagco-comment po at concerned sa akin, huwag po kayong mag-alala. ayos lang po ako. masaya, rewarding, at healthy ang relationship naming dalawa. oo, aaminin ko na medyo underweight ako ngayon nang kaunti (malnourished daw sabi ng doktor pero ano ba namang alam ng doktor? gusto lang akong pagka-perahan 'nun, eh!). medyo napapadalas din akong atakihin ng anemia (although hindi naman ako anemic dati, weird). pero, overall, perfect and happy kaming dalawa. &#x200b; tunay na love ko ang girlfriend ko!!! &#x200b; please subscribe to my pinoy horror animation channel!!! yt: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnaflx-rcdu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnaflx-rcdu)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/oiwuig/perpekto_ang_girlfriend_ko_basta_susundin_mo_lang/,12 07 2021
"An economist's (me) input on the ""Peso is not weak because the peso is weak) fiasco","tldr: sandro marcos is not wrong, but who gives a flying fuck about a technicality. the philippine peso, like other currencies, have weakened severely against the dollar. the us dollar is strengthening because of three reasons: 1. the us federal reserve (central bank) is raising their interest rates. meaning, us bonds will give better interest rates. so investors will buy dollars. 2. global uncertainty. the us dollar is a ""safe-haven currency."" meaning, if times are tough, people hoard dollars like people who hoarded alcohol and tissue during the pandemic. 3. our reliance on imports. imports aren't bad, but if your only solution to high prices is imports, you cripple your industry and subject yourself to fx risk and material risk from the exporting countries. also, you weaken your currency (low demand peso, high demand dollar) to prove the dollar is so fucking strong, here's a list of asian currencies and their respective depreciation against the dollar: 1. hkd/usd: -0.6% 2. sgd/usd: -6% 3. idr/usd: -7% 4. twd/usd: -13% 5. php/usd: -13% 6. krw/usd: -17% 7. jpy/usd: -22% if you compare the peso to other currencies, you get mixed results. so, this means the peso, relative to other currencies, is stable. while the peso, relative to the dollar, is weak. so, from a technical perspective, sandro marcos is correct. but as my tldr says, who gives a shit? i don't buy gas, shoes, cars, food, clothes, books, etc with fucking japanese yen or great british pounds. unless you soley import tea and scones from the east india trading company, you're going to need fucking dollars. almost everything in the global market is bought with us fucking dollars (thanks imperialism/capitalism). so, the effects of the weakening peso is felt by all filipinos and the techinicalities the marcos camp offers do nothing to help. there are a few things the ph can do to strengthen its currency: 1. sell dollars (this is why our international reserves are dipping. it's more of a short-term solution to temper volatility) 2. raise interest rates (which we are doing very slowly) 3. reduce import dependence (which we are not doing) 4. improve exports (which we are not since we are content exporting people) to sum up everything, sandro marcos is correct. but the effects of a weak usd/php exchange rate is felt by everyone, the technicality offers no comfort, and the ph's response to the sudden weakness is lackluster.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/y2l35w/an_economists_me_input_on_the_peso_is_not_weak/,13 10 2022
[DISCUSSION] Our HUGE population doesn't have to be a curse or weakness,"**the goal of this post is to start some nice good discussions. i didnt post this to preach my opinion** our population can actually be an asset if we can take advantage of its potential (i know...given the kind of government we have, that's a big **if**) currently, our population sits at 115 million it is projected to reach 116 million in 2024 or 2025. our population growth rate was actually decreasing steadily since the 1950's, and the rate only increased in 2020. that's almost 70yrs of continued decrease in population growth rate. note: decreasing growth rate from 1950-2020 does not mean decreasing in total population number, it means it's decreasing in ratio. decreased rate means our population was growing all those years, but it is growing at a very slow rate basically from 1950-2020 we were growing very slowly, but from 2020 up until today we're growing faster now, let's talk about numbers (and i'll keep it very simple) here are some of our population stats that are actually good: * the philippines have 115 million people, and 61% are in their ""prime years"" (age 15 to 64) * according to demographers, ages 15 to 64 are called ""prime years"" because that's the age when people are productive. according to them, age 15 is where more people either (a) pursue higher education (college/university), (b) get employed at a job, or (c) start a business. all three of those paths are crucial for a country's growth. and age 64 is when most people are physically incapable of doing a lot of work * the philippines having 61% in the prime years does not automatically mean all those people are in those 3 categories i listed on the point above, it just means 61% should be capable of doing those 3 * 61% isn't that good, but it's also not that bad...it's just okay. it's only bad because a lot of those in the 61% are not maximized to their potential (i will explain later) * on the other hand, 34.6% of our population are considered ""children"" (age 0-14). this is actually good for the future of this country, because these children will be our ""work force"" in the future. there's a misconception that fewer births are good because there are fewer mouths to feed, which means less expenses. that is **not** true. fewer children means that there will be less people who will grow up to become part of the ""prime years"" in the future. and as we established in the points above, it's bad if the country has few people in the ""prime years"" category * 34.6% of our population as children is good, the only issue here is if we can make sure these children actually grow up with a secure future (again, big **if** with this kind of government) * to prove that this is actually a good thing, just look at japan. today, they have a good ""prime year"" number (64%), which is good right now. but their government is actually worried for the future of their country, because they only have 13% in the children category. and that's seriously bad, because only few people will grow up to be productive. if they can't solve it within the next 10yrs, their economy is screwed. in the philippines, we dont have this problem * 80% of filipinos can understand basic english. that's a huge number for a non-western country. it's sad that we failed to capitalize this incredible asset. although this does not mean that all those 80% are proficient or good. the 80% are just people who understand basic english. still, that's a big number now, here's some bad statistics. with how poorly run this country is, there are so many, but i'll just focus on a few. maybe we can talk about the others on another post, but for now i'll focus on these. anyway... * 64% of our population is dependent, and that's a lot. this means the philippines is relying only on the 36% to carry this entire nation on their backs. in raw numbers, this means 41million filipinos are expected to carry and feed 115million people. that's not good * only 31% of filipinos above 25yrs old are highschool graduates * almost 1/5 of our entire population is located in these areas: metro manila, metro davao, metro cebu, and the zamboanga urban area. imagine that, 1/5 of our population are all jam-packed and crowded in just 4 urban areas what can we draw from these data? 1) we have a lot of people in our ""prime years"" category, or those who are capable of either being employed, starting a business, or enrolling in a higher education. it's a great advantage. 2) however this advantage has become a disadvantage. a lot of filipinos who are in the ""prime years"" are not employed or educated. heck 80% of our adults did not even finish highschool 3) more than half of filipinos are dependent on someone else's income 4) i know people will say more people = more traffic, but that's not automatically true. tokyo is crowded but the transport system is so good that it doesnt even matter 5) in terms of population congestion, we have a lot of people but crowding should not be a problem if done with proper planning. we're all just jam-packed in a few cities while the other areas remain under-developed solutions we should consider: - if you look at the data (both the good and bad), it looks like we need to open more jobs available to people who can be considered as **skilled workers**. it's good that we tell our youth to pursue being a professional (lawyer, engineer, doctor, accountant, etc). but we should also promote the importance of skilled workers in our economy - **skilled workers** are those who work on jobs that require training and certification, but not necessarily a college degree or diploma. examples of skilled workers are construction workers, guards, drivers, call center agents, plumbers, factory workers, etc etc - in other countries, skilled workers are very respected and called the ""backbone of the workforce"" but here in the philippines they're considered as just lowly ""uneducated employees"". in other countries they are considered as an important cornerstone of the economy, i hope we can do that same here - we talked about how a lot of filipinos in the ""prime years"" are not productive, but the solution to this is to promote jobs available to skilled workers. stop looking at skilled workers as uneducated or not important. again in other countries, they are respected and they are seen as people who are crucial to the economy - we should stop the mindset that if you're not a college graduate, you should be a businessman instead. you can also be a skilled worker. - of course, you need to pay them well. you also need to lower the requirements. we dont need a diploma for these jobs, and that's actually the point. we already have a hard time producing higschool graduates, if we cant also produce skilled workers then things will just get worse - the government should start programs that will encourage adults to have **more children**. i know this sub doesnt like that statement, but hear me out. if the government can assure us that children will have a bright future in this country, i dont know why having more children is a bad thing - increase our salaries, give us benefits, and improve public services. if that happens it's almost a guarantee that our children will take care of this country in the future - create more opportunities outside metro manila, cebu, davao, and zamboanga area. so much of our population is jam-packed in just these 4 areas. make jobs available outside these areas. - 80% of our population speaks english and yet we havent thought of ways to use it for our advantage. we always teach students that english is the key to ""globalization"", but it's a shame that a lot of our neighbors who are very bad at english (like s.korea and japan) are more globalized than us. **tldr:** having a big population is not bad, it's only bad if all those people are not productive. a population that's both big and productive is good sources i used for the numbers and raw data: [source 1](https://countrymeters.info/en/philippines), [source 2](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1067059/population-philippines-historical/), [source 3](https://mb.com.ph/2023/8/16/47-of-filipinos-competent-in-english-language-sws), [source 4](https://www.pbed.ph/blogs/47/pbed/state%20of%20philippine%20education%20report%202023)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/18dexdn/discussion_our_huge_population_doesnt_have_to_be/,8 12 2023
Bakit weak ang tingin sa mga taong 'di umiinom?,"hindi ko maintindihan kung bakit may mga taong pinagyayabang na magaling sila uminom (alcohol) tapos parang pinapalabas na inferior yung mga hindi pa nakatikim ng alak their whole life? it's annoying. i get it. they love drinking and it's a part of our culture (?) but there's no need to embarass those who don't drink. my 25 years old girl cousin and my spoiled brat 15 years old sister thinks they are superior because they drink and i don't. since it's christmas, there's a lot of alcohol in our house. they (with their friends) offered me a drink and i declined saying i tasted one before and didn't like it but their response were ""weh? talaga? nakainom ka na? weak mo naman. "" ""ang boring mo kasi sis."" ""puro aral lang nga ginagawa mo."" okay lang naman kung nagtatanong sila ng sincere pero iba talaga yung tono ng pagkakasabi. nakakainis talaga dahil palagi na lang nangyayari 'to. and they proceeded bragging what kind of drinks have they tried and that they have a high alcohol tolerance. like duh, that's what you're proud of? i can't even have any deep conversation with them because all they talk about are pop culture and life of celebrities.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/kjzpho/bakit_weak_ang_tingin_sa_mga_taong_di_umiinom/,25 12 2020

These 88M supporters really have no chill.,"pa-rant lang po, hehe. so, i was scrolling through my facebook feed and i saw that one of my kakampink friends shared inquirer.net's post about the massive crowd gathering at the ateneo de manila university grounds for vp leni and sen. kiko's thanksgiving event. hindi ko alam kung anong ine-expect ko no'ng binuksan ko 'yung comment section pero na-disappoint pa rin ako as it's filled with 88m supporters preaching about ""moving on"", ""tapos na ang eleksyon"", and ""respecting the decision of the majority"". like, this isn't even about you! why are these apologists always so triggered seeing posts that are mentioning ""vp leni"" or ""sen. kiko""? the kakampinks are having a *thanksgiving gathering*. walang sinabing they're conducting a *political rally*. so, anong sense ng pagko-comment ng ""tapos na ang eleksyon""? we know, okay? now, go back to tiktok and feed yourself some more disinformation. isa pa, rinding-rindi na 'ko sa ""move on"" script nila. martial law human rights violation? move on. 88m's tax evasion? move on. im3lda's seven counts of graft? move on. lahat na lang, move on! panay preach ng moving on pero 'yung iniidolo nila, nagpa-recount nang tatlong beses no'ng natalo sa pagka-bise presidente no'ng 2016. tapos kahit napatunayan nang natalo talaga s'ya at hindi dinaya, ang narrative n'ya, dinaya pa rin s'ya. gano'n din ang thinking ng mga tagasuporta n'ya. the acidity and dua lipaty. saka move on na raw tayo, they said. talo na raw kasi tayo, they said. nanalo na sila, bakit hellbent pa rin sila sa pagtambay sa posts about leni-kiko (na hindi naman para sa kanila) just to spread negativity at ipamuk'ang *nanalo* sila? kami ba talaga ang hindi maka-move on? o kayo? why are they so obsessed with the two? bakit sila 'tong supporters ni bleng blong ang may fixation k'ila vp leni at sen. kiko? lastly, i don't really get the ""respetuhin na lang ang gusto ng majority"". o... kay? last time i checked, thanksgiving ang ganap, hindi naman protesta. the kakampinks are not demanding for a recount (which is something na hindi pa rin naman talaga p'wedeng gawin since wala pang official result), they are just merely giving thanks and celebrating with each other for a meaningful campaign. i swear, sila lang ang supporters na nakita kong panalo na nga, bitter pa rin. gano'n ba talaga kapag alam nilang maling kandidato ang hinalal nila? well, it's too late. now, vp leni and sen. kiko are having the time of their lives while the loyalists are sulking at home, waiting for a victory party that i don't think is ever going to happen 'cause 88m's too busy drinking with his ""rich af"" friends. saka their nerve to say ""well-mannered is better than educated"" when in fact, they are not both.

Job interview experience,"so today i messed up my interview big time, this is my 3rd face to face interview experience after being idle for 2 years after graduation because of my stuttering disorder. i had develop this disability during my college days, i don't know how and when it started but i just find myself having difficulty reciting and presenting in the classroom that's why after graduation i didn't find work immediately because i was afraid to be interviewed so i just gave the excuse of reviewing for board exam and covid to my parents so that they won't pressure me to work. no one knows in my family of this situation, only my college teachers and classmates who knows it. i thought i can cure it on my own, and that time can cure it, i did some tutoring to improve my stutter, i practiced presenting in front of the mirror, and i forced myself to socialize more but i found out today that i'm still not over this problem. my last two interviews was kinda informal, it's just like speaking with a friend and the atmosphere was noisy but i did okay speaking in front of many people and talking to the interviewer but today's interview was very formal, the atmosphere was so solemn, it was a closed door interview with the head dept and hr. when they dropped the first question, suddenly i can't speak, i had difficulty swallowing and i can't just utter a word, i froze and i saw how the interviewers eye each other, i knew i just messed up. i even pressed my throat forcing a cough and drinks water, and with a very shaky voice i told them about my disorder, and asked them respectfully to repeat the question, despite being mad at myself and feeling ashamed, i forced myself to continue answering it with my stuttering voice and because of it i had difficulty saying what i practiced and speaking what's on my mind and just answered very shortly. after 15 mins or so, my voice kept improving and i gained a tiny bit of confidence and i also became a bit talkative but looking at the interviewers current attitude, i knew i cannot redeem myself anymore. compared to the first applicant, my interview was very short. i was teary eyed leaving the office and when i arrived at the waiting area, some workers at the company and the first applicant was there and they notice me wiping my nose, they jokingly asked me if i cried so i composed myself and i said i was just having a runny nose because of the rain earlier but then the hr came, and i was so shocked when she just asked me why i am so tense at the interview in front of these people, she said she didn't asked me more cause i was very nervous etc. i don't mind being point out with my mistakes but i definitely don't want other people knowing what happen at the interview, i was expecting the hr to talk to me privately about the results and give me feedback with my performance just like my last interview but to say it in public and given my situation, i was very embarrassed so i just cried there, in front of those people. i don't want to attend job interviews anymore, and i just want to go home to my parents. my mind was full of negative thoughts, i am very depressed but then i realized my brother is waiting for me in front of the company, he was very tired after working overnight but he still accompany me because i just move in this place. he is very hungry and sleepy and because it's almost 4 pm, he can't go to work tonight. i was so guilty, and i am so mad at myself. i was the only one in my family who graduated in college, they are expecting so much from me but then it was so sad i am a failure. i don't have anyone to talk to and i am just crying silently here in my bed so i just want to share my situation here in reddit so that i can at least let out some bottled up feelings. i have a final interview this week with the same company who interviewed me first and also just got another call for a new one next week. i hope i can recover from this and do well for the next interviews.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/v2gpkp/job_interview_experience/,1 06 2022
My wife’s COVID19 story,"hello, just want to share this story to all of you. my wife by the way has recovered already and it’s been a month now. thankfully she only had mild symptoms when she got covid. but i’m going to share how she got the virus so that other people can be informed and can prevent themselves from being infected. march 30, we had a swab test at our house but my bro in law included his staff on that day. staff needed a swab test cert to go to a province. unfortunately, the staff arrived early and she was given a seat at the garage. she was already there about 5 minutes before the person who will do the swab arrived. the garage was a typical open air. she also did not talk, did not cough nor even sneeze. but she put down her mask every once in a while because she wiped her face with a small towel. i think she did this around 2-3 times. she also had runny nose on that day. come swab time, the first 2 person had their blood test taken and not nasal swab. after those 2, it was my wife’s turn and she was scheduled to be swabbed. so she put down her mask only for a few seconds. after the swab, the mask went up to cover her nose and mouth. she was also seated around 2 meters from the staff, and it was not directly adjacent. after my wife, my bro in law got swabbed and then the staff. later that day, we got the news that the staff was positive for covid. my wife’s symptoms appeared after 3 days from that interaction. prior to those days, we rarely go out and she had 2 masks on every time and we spray alcohol for every foreign object that we touched. aside from my wife, a yaya also got infected but her symptoms appeared on the 5th day. this nanny went out to the garage without a mask but for less than 10 seconds. she gave the mobile phone to my wife’s sister bec someone was calling. i think she was about 1-2 meters away from the staff as well. this nanny doesn’t go out for day offs bec she’s afraid and she does not even go to the gate to receive packages or talk to other people. so we’re pretty sure that she got the virus from that staff. lessons that i learned from this: - the virus is airborne and 1 meter is not enough. actually, i searched who and it mentioned that covid19 can last upto 3 hours in the air. - before, we thought that an infected person needs to cough, sneeze or talk for their virus to spread. but in this case, i think the virus spread when she flipped her towel. - there were about 7 people on that garage and only 2 were infected bec the other 5 had their masks on. - it only takes a few seconds for you to get the virus especially if you don’t have a mask. i heard from someone that you need minutes to be infected. hope this helps :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/nc0qpu/my_wifes_covid19_story/,14 05 2021

Liabilities after minor car accident,"what are my responsibilities after a minor car accident? i was driving a pick up and an oncoming motorcycle got outbalanced since we were both shocked (it was a blind curve). the motorcycle riders were an old couple (if this is relevant to the case). the old man had no driver’s license. they suffered minor scratches, car got a looong scratch on the side. we provided first aid, and took them to the hospital immediately after. i paid for the meds that they needed and the doctor did not recommend for any other treatment or xray. upon checking the dashcam, it was clear that the motorcycle slightly went out of their lane which caused the collision. now the couple’s daughter reached out, told that the old lady is suffering of chest pains. it has been a month after the accident. seemingly, the daughter wanted her mom to get checked. am i still liable for the medical expenses if ever?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/rr8i4i/liabilities_after_minor_car_accident/,29 12 2021
Memoirs of a bullied girl,"just want to get this off my chest i am 30-ish now but i'm still traumatized because of bullying. it went on from elementary until high school, but high school was worst. i've been bullied mainly because of my looks. my classmates made fun of me for being ugly and it didn't help that i wasn't good in academics that time. i was bullied, teased everyday. they would call me betty la fea, put trash in my bag, hide my stuff intentionally among many others. name it, i've experienced all sorts and forms of bullying one could ever imagine. at that time, i didn't know how to stand up for myself. i didn't have the courage to stand up against them. i'm too afraid. i cried a lot but i didn't told anyone about it. not even to my small circle of friends. not even to my teachers. i just kept it all to myself. being absent in class makes me happy everytime because i won't have to see them. going home after class and school vacations were always a big thing for me because i feel safe away from these bullies. i hate going to school and i am happy and sooo relieve when i graduated high school. at last! finally i won't see them anymore. they won't be able to hurt me anymore. for the longest time i now felt free. college is way way way better. i made friends and excel in academics. i learned to speak for myself. i found my voice. far from my miserable elementary and high school life. though the trauma caused by these bullies never healed fully. even as an adult, i still have recurring dreams of me being back in school with my bullies where they tried to hurt me and made fun of me again but these times i now know how to fight back and put them in their place. waking up to these dreams makes me feel happy that at least even in my dreams i can stood up, confront, humiliate them for being a bully and gave them a taste of their own medicine. though at the same time, a part of me still feels sad because all through these years i still carry the pain, the traumas that they have caused me. i wish to heal but its too difficult to forget everything that they have done to me. them moving on and me not getting the apology i deserve. life is indeed unfair.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/169nc16/memoirs_of_a_bullied_girl/,4 09 2023

She saw 6 men murder her parents. The cops killed 1 and declared the case solved.,"[she saw 6 men murder her parents. the cops killed 1 and declared the case solved.](https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/investigative/caloocan-drug-war-survivor-account-parents-killed-case-status-exhumation-series/?utm_campaign=echobox&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook&fbclid=iwar0kn02yoxs5p1o3n3x7lfroccj0gkzjaydgtal4ss1febacdkbmnjv197q#echobox=1642730940) jan 21, 2022 10:00 am pht *when she was 11, lovely ramos saw six men kill her parents inside their home. the philippine national police killed one in a shootout and closed the case.* in the murder of adrian peregrino and vivian ramos, the sole witnesses were their children. the eldest, named lovely, is a small girl with big eyes. she was 11. the home turned into a crime scene at around 3 am on august 15, 2016. a tense vivian was walking in circles in their matchbox home in caloocan city. she held a piece of paper as adrian and their children slept. knocks on the door woke up and rattled lovely. vivian stood ready. two men barged in, the one in the front holding a piece of paper. vivian faced them, showing them her own. “’di po kami ’yan, sir. ’wag ’nyo po kaming papatayin,” vivian pleaded. (we are not the ones you’re looking for, sir. don’t kill us.) the men wore black. their shoes were black. their pants were black. their jackets were black. their faces were covered by black bonnetts, with holes big enough only for them to see, smell, and speak. their guns were black, too. vivian’s words did nothing to stop the men. one walked straight to the dozing adrian and kicked him conscious, pointed a pistol to his head, and shot him three times. the men left as vivian and her children wept. but it wasn’t over. the men returned, walking straight to vivian. lovely knew what was coming. she was barely four feet tall, the intruders three heads taller than her, but with her father studded with bullets, at that moment, she wanted to kill. heat rising in her chest, she stood between the men and her mother. “putangina ’nyo! ang kakapal ng mukha ’nyo! wala kayong awa!” lovely screamed as she shed tears. (you motherfuckers! how dare you? you have no mercy!) vivian reached out again with the same piece of paper that failed to save her husband – a certificate. it was proof that, just the month before, drug suspects like adrian, a tricycle driver, and herself, a manicurist, had surrendered to local officials for rehabilitation. they promised they would change for the better, and, in exchange, they would be given immunity from execution – or so they thought. it was a month into the presidency of rodrigo duterte, when at the peak of his so-called war on drugs dozens were being killed daily by policemen and vigilantes. their targets were the same: drug suspects. duterte wove a tale about them being the source of all ills in the country. declaring all drug users as addicts just the same, duterte once said he would be “happy to slaughter” them all – as adolf hitler did with the jews. “please don’t. that’s my daughter. this is our document, proof that we have surrendered,” vivian continued to explain. “we don’t need that, what we need is both of you,” the man answered. what the man meant was they needed her partner and herself dead. a shot to vivian’s arm. lovely charged forward, forcing her mother back. the gunman locked his gun to lovely’s head. “don’t. she’s a child,” a voice warned from behind the shooter. vivian pulled lovely behind her and dropped to her knees. she begged them to stop. lovely hoped the man would listen, to find it in himself to see what was in front of him – a defenseless woman with her defenseless child, trembling. the man still shot her mother in the head. “duterte kami,” they said, as they walked out. “we are duterte.” a generation of victims adrian breathed. it looked like he wanted to say something to lovely. she walked closer, tried to string his moans into words. before she could make sense of them, blood choked her father, then he completely fell silent. she turned to her mother and tried to cradle her lifeless body. as she propped her up, lovely’s small hand went through the back of her mother’s head. her skull had been shattered. lovely’s parents would be among the first victims in duterte’s anti-drug campaign, which has since killed at least 7,000 drug suspects in police operations as of january 2022. killings by vigilantes inspired by duterte included, the number of fatalities hovered at around 30,000 as of 2019, according to human rights groups. the number has risen since then. lovely would be among the first of many – one child in a generation who lost either their father or mother, and in lovely’s case, both, to gunmen who left as quickly as they came. finding the killers lovely swore the killers of her parents were policemen. the damning evidence was the piece of paper one of them carried to their home. she said it was a warrant. over a week later, police knocked on their doors with news. good news, they said. the police found adrian and vivian’s killer. then, they killed him. on the evening of september 1, 2016, a certain restituto romero was shot dead in san vicente street in caloocan city. police rushed to the crime scene and found a witness. the killer was a man riding a red, white, and black honda wave. he wore black. the officers on the scene radioed the rundown to their city-wide communications line. minutes later, they found him, whizzing on his motorbike through bagong silang, near caloocan’s boundary with the province of bulacan. the intercepting police team was led by then-colonel reydante ariza, the highest-ranking policeman on the night shift. they signaled the rider to stop, but he only hit the turbo. the chase led to a shootout, which led to the death of the killer. investigator rhyan rodriguez remembered that night. it was already over when he arrived, the killer already cold. his job mostly involved writing down what he saw. he noted the date and time, their location, where the bullets landed, where the motorcycle fell, how the killer spread on the street, and how the scene of the crime operatives (soco) unmasked the killer – helmet first, bonnet next. he stopped writing. it was a familiar face. a cop. elpidio manding was a policeman from caloocan city. he was over a decade ahead of rodriguez in the service, so ahead that when the investigator was still a student, that cop was already elpidio manding of the caloocan city police office. “organic” was how rodriguez described him, a policeman who was assigned to his own hometown, bound there until he retired. but manding was a nuisance case. by the time he allegedly shot it out with his superiors, he had been labeled awol. he stopped showing up, and word in the caloocan police headquarters was that he ditched the badge for a more lucrative job at a security agency. the soco extracted a gun, a packet of shabu (methamphetamine), then they found a piece of paper. it was a list of names. rodriguez knew some of them. there was restituto romero, who was killed the same day. then, there was adrian peregrino and vivian ramos. the piece of paper that lovely saw was a kill list. how probes die rodriguez was the same investigator in the killing of adrian and vivian. with manding found and killed, he declared the case solved. rodriguez’s reasoning was simple: manding matched the description of witnesses in the killing of adrian and vivian – a man clad in black riding a motorcycle – and the victims’ names appeared on his kill list. who else would kill the couple? in lovely’s memory, she did not count only one man who killed her parents, she counted six: two men barged into their house, while four men stood guard outside. for lovely, there would only be justice when all of the men – the killer and his accomplices – were captured. she also wanted them killed. but the police did nothing more. rodriguez did not interview lovely nor her siblings. all his witnesses were outside when the double murder happened. rodriguez conceded one thing: that there was more than one killer. his witnesses confirmed that two men intruded. but, five years later, that one killer was still at large. even with manding being an awol police officer, rodriguez did not probe into the possibility that manding’s accomplice was a policeman too. despite all this, the case was still branded as solved and shelved. this was how the investigation turned cold. in 2016, when the war on drugs was at its peak, people died by the dozen per day. in caloocan city alone, rodriguez counted at least five a night. rodriguez knew because he was one of only two homicide investigators manning the night shift. before he could make progress with one killing, another would follow not long after. “even if we wanted to probe more, we couldn’t do it, given the number of cases there were. it was the peak of the killings,” rodriguez said in filipino. caloocan continued to be a killing field. it was in the same city that three minors were killed in a span of two months in 2017. the police’s credibility plummeted so much that the metro manila police chief then, oscar albayalde, decided to fire all caloocan cops in september 2017. rodriguez was one of them. rodriguez turned over his case folders to an investigator who had no experience in caloocan. he couldn’t even remember his name. rodriguez was only reassigned to caloocan in late 2018, and he no longer probed into the death of lovely’s parents. “kasi meron nang nahuling isa,” rodriguez said. (because one was already captured.) by the internal standards of the philippine national police, if one suspect in a case is captured or killed, the case is considered solved. in the philippines, there can be 20 killers in a case, with only one of them captured, yet the police can still declare it solved – a death sentence to the probe. “the painful reality is, old cases get buried by new ones. it’s the new ones that get the priority,” rodriguez said. the case of lovely’s parents could still be reopened, but it would take the caloocan police the will and resources to listen to lovely, who was still a minor. lovely would also have to trust the police with the case, which to her, was impossible. a child dreams five years passed. lovely turned 16. she lived with her aunt marichu, vivian’s youngest sister, in a house not more than 50 meters from where her parents were killed. the home’s door was made of metal, engraved with the outline of a rosary. right above it, pressed in all capital letters, was one word: family. they were 12 in the house, with lovely still the eldest child. vivian and adrian were with them, ashes in urns they kept above their cabinets. in lovely’s dreams, she saw them alive, flesh and bone. lovely wanted to follow them, to stay with them longer. – rappler.com",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/s9d0zf/she_saw_6_men_murder_her_parents_the_cops_killed/,21 01 2022

BBM's master plan,"bbm probably has the most effective grasp of social media amongst all filipino politicians. he's not making it obvious, pero i would bet na lahat ng nagvaviral at nalabas tungkol sa mga politiko, lalo na sa mga duterte, may basbas nia. sara's recent loss of popularity is just a start, he will drag the duterte name through the mud, and nobody will be able to do anything about it. his competence on this front should not be surprising, he was one of the first filipino politicians to actually have a social media presence, this is actually something he's been familiar with for years. [fyrebrand18](https://www.reddit.com/user/fyrebrand18/) and i had a conversation on another thread about it, and i wanted to flesh the theory out a bit more. duterte's rise might be something that bbm actually orchestrated from the shadows - he poisoned pnoy's image, found a reviling but charismatic candidate who the masses can get behind, empowered him to make as many blunders as he could, rode his fame to the top position in the land, all the while spending political capital to relegate the past president's chosen heir-apparent to 2nd fiddle. now that he has come to power, instead of continuing duterte's destruction or his father's authoritarianism, he surprises everyone by actually becoming a boring, reasonably competent, semi-reliable president, ala pnoy part 2 don't get me wrong, he and his cronies will still be thieving and making money hand- over-fist, but since the bar was set to low by our previous president who was a perfect personification of satan's armpit, bbm still smells like roses. while doing this publicly, he works in the shadows to destroy duterte's reputation. before the end of this term, duterte and his spawn will all be relegated to obscurity if they are lucky, or will spend their last days languishing in prison if they are not. now here comes bbm's finale, the prestige: he supports and empowers a moderate and progressive candidate that will actually improve the economy and the countries image: leni robredo (or mar roxas). they win, and even if there are anomalies to how they won, we will all be collectively celebrating and sighing in relief that we would not even care. history is going to fuckin see him as a savior, and he actually achieves what he sets out to accomplish: he restores the marcos name.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/17jspoa/bbms_master_plan/,30 10 2023

A close encounter with COVID-19.,"guys, just want to share my personal experience. do not let your guard down even with friends or relatives, especially if you have elderly, children or sickly family members. the short story is that i have three siblings, girls ages 17 (twins) and 12, who have been staying with me for more than a year and a half now because our mom is sumakabilang bahay. their dad died in 2017. i have another brother from the same mother, he is 18 years old recently graduated from senior high. i did not take him in cause of a few reasons. one, i have an ate 30 and another brother who is 22 who are capable of taking him in. i already have three girls with me and it's more than what i can handle already. second, i know he can't be contained meaning lakwatsero so he's a real risk for us especially that i have a baby aged 1 and a half. three, he's annoying. however, recently, naawa ako. i am usually mataray and masungit sa kanya, just to push him away. i am a realy push over and minsan hindi ako makatiis so this is how i cope with it na i pretend to be masama, mataray and masungit so people won't ask me for favors. august, naawa ako sa kanya and he really has no place to say. my brother and sister who were supposed to take him in, both are selfish in their own right, all in all walang kwenta. so i let him stay. he has a bike so sideline niya is delivery so i let him. i also have a bike and i also deliver my selling goods so i know to just disinfect, keep your distance and minimal contact. i let him stay at our house, he's staying at the part of our living room that nobody goes to and is right infront of our other door for entrance. for the rest, yes, he's using our utensils, bathroom, kitchen, etc. this was a big mistake for me. come his birthday, end of august, i bought him some food and a cake and after that he ate and run. i said, if you're leaving this house, you're not coming back. he said yes. i told him good. but then, my fiance, also a big push over, opened the door when my brother knocked. i told him, why did you let him in? he said well nakakaawa. i said my sister should be responsible in finding a place for him, not us and he said just let him stay it's okay with me. so i did. after three days, nawalan ng panlasa. i knew it, he threw his friends a birthday party and probably they were drinking. i said get out of this house and get picked up by the barangay elsewhere. he asked me what he should do, i said i already told you what to do. i told you to stay indoors right? now, i don't care just leave. i have young siblings here, i have a baby, my fiance is very sickly since he was a kid, i have my step mother who has asthma and is very sick, we have a tenant upstairs who has a baby as well. my sister also called and i told her i told you. why did you let him stay here with us when you know we are at risk. she claimed that she did not know that he was staying here. we disinfected the entire house. i threw out his clothes to the garage and everything he had used. we used up all the chlorine and alcohol that we had. even doing that felt pointless. we were already exposed. we used the same utensils, we used the same door handles, the same bathroom, he touched the refrigirator, the dining table and chairs, everything. all i can do was pray. after 8 days, he tested positive for covid. he currently remains asymptomatic aside for the loss of senses such as taste and smell. we did not get any tests done because none of us experienced any symptoms. it's been more than 15 days since. we are all fine. but the entire time, i was really... mad. for his birthday, he put other people at risk, his own family. i threw him a small birthday party and it was not enough for him. i said, he could have lived with me until the end of the pandemic and i would not mind. he could have ate and slept here for free but he chose to have a good time with his friends in exchange for our health and safety. guys, don't let anyone into your home. do not feel safe, not even with your own family. this was a close call. i will never put my family at risk again just because i feel like i am selfish by not letting someone in. it's been 20 days since and we are healthy and fine. even my father, my step mother, my other siblings, my in laws who were exposed because they visited while my brother was still here, our tenants. no one got sick. i would not know what to do if we contracted covid-19. it was an excruciating two weeks for me, not knowing what is going to happen.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/itfju1/a_close_encounter_with_covid19/,15 09 2020

Digicars Auto Trading smells fishy,"i recently inquired to their motorcyle line offer as it seems you'd get a huge discount if you get through them. at first i thought they're a dealer but they've corrected me and claim to be a broker instead. i asked the process and here's one of their agents' reply; "" si digicars po is registered as accredited merchandise broker, hindi po kami dealer. familiar po ba kayo sa mga broker? yung mga broker po are selling properties condominium and house & lot. we specialized motorcycle and car vehicles. we offer system only 0% interest + big discount requiring 50% sa motor and 30% sa sasakyan our program will help you to lower your monthly amortization and magkakaron din po kayo ng discount sa inyong unit. then standard process po maghahanap tayo ng dealer like suzuki,motortrade,wheeltek etc... aapplyan po natin yung pinaka lowest downpayment ng unit na preferred niyo sa dealer. atleast 10% to 15% ng srp ng unit pasok po samin yun. tapos ganto po mangyayare kapag nakahanap na tayo ng dealer magaapply na kayo ipasa niyo na lahat ng requirements and application na hinihingi nila. para ma c.i na kayo ganto po kapag nag c.i na sainyo hindi po natin pwede banggitin na ipapasok natin sa digicars yung unit niyo or kahit nagiinquire palang tayo wag natin babanggitin dahil dun palang madecline na tayo sayang lang, ang thinking po kasi ng dealer kaya niyo ipapasok yung unit niyo samin is hindi kayo capable magbayad ng monthly sa offer nila and policy din po kasi ng dealer na kung sino ang principal borrower which is kayo ay dapat kayo ang magbabayad. kaya to avoid conflict ganyang po gagawin natin after c.i, for example approved na kayo pwede niyo na irelease yung unit puntahan niyo mismo asikasuhin yung mga documents dahil sainyo nakapangalan magbabayad na kayo ng down payment sakanila para marelease niyo na yung unit, yung unit downpayment payment na babayaran niyo sakanila is deductable sa 50% required downpayment namin. after niyo sa dealer proceed na po tayo sa digicars para magbayad ng remaining downpayment. magkano yung remaining downpayment? for example motortrade 5,000 unit dp (sinakto ko lang po para hindi nakakalito) digicars 38,450 required dp 5,000 - 38,450 = 33,450 \*\* remaining downpayment to be paid @ digicars once na nabayaran niyo nayan kanino na kayo mag hulog monthly? sa digicars na po kayo maghuhulog ng monthly kung ano po offer namin yun na po ang amount na susundin niyo. ang payment po is thru bank deposit or gcash chinabank corporation. ibibigay po sainyo bank acct details once na nakaavail na kayo. sino na ang magbabayad ng monthly sa dealer? digicars na po ang maghuhulog monthly sa dealer every month under your name sir. every month magsesend po kami sainyo ng proof of payment. take note advance po maghulog si digicars 3days before due bayad na po yan so pwede niyo na mismo icheck sa dealer kung pumasok na hulog niyo. may ipoprovide po sainyo si digicars na legal documents nakanotaryo po ng abugado and contract agreement na pipirmahan niyo para mabigyan kayo ng assurance. kaya kasabay po ng pagbabayad niyo sa office may meeting po tayo for terms of agreement manager ko po mismo magdiscuss. ang requirements na dadalin niyo lang sa office - all documents ng unit at receipt - 2 valid id's - downpayment "" after i read this i'm quite determined that this is indeed some sort of modus. tho i really hope i'm wrong coz they seem to have a lot of clients.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/s64uu5/digicars_auto_trading_smells_fishy/,17 01 2022
"As a muslim who recently started eating pork, has pork always been like this?","may naamoy din ba kayong unpleasant everytime kumakain kayo ng baboy? as someone who is born a muslim, i've always abstained from eating pork. i've never been a devout muslim nor a firm believer of our religion but i do pray from time to time especially on certain religious occasions because i still believe that there is a god. it's been more than a year since i last prayed and that was when i was still living in my home province. i recently moved out to work at a city where majority of the population don't abstain from eating it. ever since i was a kid, people always asked me how it feels like not to be able to eat pork. there were even times that they would tell me how big i was missing out. and to be honest, i've always been curious as to what it really tasted like. i frequently come across food contents in social media showing varying dishes of it. oo, nakakalaway sya paminsan to the point that i was really curious if masarap ba talaga. it was last year when i started eating pork. it was during a special occasion in our firm where almost all meals served had pork in it. at first, i didn't know how to tell everyone that i don't eat pork and it felt like it would be a hassle for all of them na sila pa mag-aadjust para sakin. so as someone who was never really a devout practitioner of our religion, i said ""yeah sure, i'll try it tutal borderline atheist din naman ako eh"". so i did taste every meal na may pork without telling anyone that i was a muslim (on paper at least). and to my surprise, it wasn't that impressive. it's kinda meh. there are dishes that were ok but nothing really stood out even yung lechon (this is cebu ah). but one thing i noticed is that pork has this distinct smell/after-taste na sobrang nakaka turn-off. parang amoy tangkal especially yung mga crispy pata and ribs. i feel like i would need to put a lot of calamansi and pepper just to mask that smell/after-taste. i've asked my friends if same ba din ang case for them if may naaamoy din ba sila na unpleasant. almost all of them ang sagot is wala naman so i thought maybe it's just me kasi di ako sanay kumain ng baboy. until one day, a friend of mine (a christian) pointed out that pork has this unpleasant smell. he described it as amoy ""tangkal"". i immediately agreed kasi that's how i would describe it. i would also sometimes come across videos on social media where they would soak the meat in baking soda first before cooking it just to get rid of the ""porky smell"". so i started thinking na baka nga di lang ako nakakaamoy neto. kayo ba, do you sometimes experience the same?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/163gkw8/as_a_muslim_who_recently_started_eating_pork_has/,28 08 2023

Be careful of what you consume while traveling abroad.,"a good friend stayed in china for 2 weeks to visit his relatives. he was in good shape and ate healthy food, and i can attest he took good care of his body. until he visited shaanxi. he and his relatives frequented different restaurants while he was still there. he was never picky nor had any issues with food. but a bowl of soup from one of the chinese restaurants messed him up really badly. he had intense intestinal pain and could barely do anything due to the cramps he suffered. when at the hospital in china, the doctor asked him if he ate something he was not used to having and he said he’d never had any issues trying different cuisines. for whatever reason, the doctor asked him the last restaurant he had eaten at before the debacle happened. the doctor said the restaurant was suspected of using gutter oil (basically, oil that came from a grease trap) that may have caused his diarrhea. multiple deaths had happened in that place due to the consumption of food that was cooked using gutter oil. edit: i used to work for a restaurant in malate and have collected gutter oil since it was part of my duty as a waiter. every month, we could collect 2-3 buckets, and someone would pick them up and pay around 300 or 400 per container. so, yeah... i never knew what they did with the oil—never wanted to know even—and had never expected that grease that smelled diabolical could be recycled until my friend relayed the gutter oil mishap.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/18fg2eb/be_careful_of_what_you_consume_while_traveling/,10 12 2023
Worst or most memorable experiences while riding UV Express?,"honestly curious sa mga experiences niyo while riding the uv express vans. and might as well share mine na rin, hehe. psa: pasintabi po sa mga kumakain (you might wanna scroll past this one, haha). super traumatizing, i still remember the smell to this day. i was in my 3rd year of college and otw back to alabang from my uni (since long weekend ata nung time na toh). merong mag-jowa na nakaupo sa may waiting area and idk pero may something odd kasi kay ate girl. like she was acting strange for some reason but i decided to leave her be. also, for about 30 minutes before we left the terminal, super landi nilang dalawa (as in can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other type of landi) and at some points in the corner of my eye i noticed na nag-ffull on momol sesh sila, lol. anyway, since puno na yung seats we were preparing na to leave. umakyat na rin si girl & guy (sa harap sila umupo, which later on i was incredibly thankful for). during the entire ride they were super loud and overly affectionate pa rin but oh well. everyone was too tired to care anyway. but when we were about 20 minutes from molito, si ate girl she suddenly pulls away from the guy and covers her mouth with both hands, then *projectile vomits* all over the entire front row. i remember it splashing all over the windshield. i think some of the splash rebound went kay kuya driver huhu, and some to her boyfriend. sobrang unexpected lang talaga since barely a minute ago they were all up each other's face doing god-knows-what. i was sitting directly behind them but thank god we weren't within the splash zone + buti na lang may box of tissues si kuya driver (but i think at this point it really wasn't much help na since it was dripping everywhere anyway). i've seen a few people throw up/get nauseous in transpo before but nothing like this one. you could tell din na spaghetti yung lunch niya that day huhu (i did not eat spaghetti for the next 6 months following this incident). i think all of us in the van held our reactions in because we didn't want them to feel bad. pero grabe huhu, the smell was definitely one to remember. took this as a lesson na lang, ever since then i started bringing white flower oil or vicks inhalers with me whenever i rode the uv express. decided to bring some of those small foldable vomit bags from airplanes as well just in case. you never really know when they could come in handy. is this a common occurrence? has anybody witnessed something similar? feel free to share any memorable events you have encountered while riding mga uv vans (or any public transport vehicle for that matter)!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/189xfpw/worst_or_most_memorable_experiences_while_riding/,3 12 2023

Pet Owners,"hello, just wanted to get insight on pet ownership responsibility. recently some malls in ncr are now becoming pet friendly. over the course of a year the number of dog pets i've seen in malls are becoming more prominent. although i don't have anything against dog pets as i also have pets at our house. so during my observation i saw several differences, there are dogs whoe are wearing diapers and those who don't. now of course those who don't have diapers will always have a tendency to urinate and defecate on the mall flooring. and yes i've seen the owner clean it up but i don't think the cleaning they did is enough to make sure everything is alright. to give an example, a mall in capitol commons have been very pet friendly, but nowadays there is already a pungent smell that is similar to dog piss. now please note that there are a lot of restaurants down there. so while eating you can't help but smell it. i can't help but worry that some kids play in the mall flooring and sometimes they even get tipped off and fall flat on the floor. now i understand that the mall management provides some sort of cleaning activity in the mall, but the pungent smell still remains upto this day. as a pet owner, should we allow pets that doesn't have diapers go inside malls and continue the cause of this smell? or there will come a time that it should also be regulated? what are your thoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/zpqe17/pet_owners/,19 12 2022

"Influencers/brands endorsing gonzaga sisters will always be political, and there’s no being “neutral” to it.","first of all, hindi basta bastang influencer yung dalawa (and yung paul soriano). they’re star endorsers of their political party. think of it like anne curtis and enervon. you can’t see one without the other. hindi mawawala yung political attachment nila, they endorsed the same people that caused their co-leagues to lose their jobs. throwing them under the bus for money (they practically sided with the abs-cbn shutdown despite being part of abs-cbn for so long, and they get paid lots of money for that.) they pretend they are holy christians* (edited) when they represent literal evil. what makes them worse than just a uniteam endorser, is that they are hypocrites, and they are infamous for that. so when brands or influencers partner with them, they can not just “work with a kakampink endorser” to balance it out. you can’t put seasonings in soup full of literal shit and expect it to taste good. b/b/m would have had way less interactions had there not been a toni gonzaga and boy abunda interview. their attempt to humanify (they succeeded) the marcoses helped push them towards the masses. you can’t deny that. so, after all that, how could you still be “neutral” about the gonzagas? edit: this might become too idealistic in the future to boycott all brands associated to them (what if nag endorse sila ng airasia, gg tayo kase marcos cronies yung cebupac and pal), pero if it’s discretionary lang naman it won’t be much of a loss for us. mahirap lalo na if we have so little alternatives. pero sana nga big name companies will also know how much of their goodwill will be lost once they endorse the gonzagas and the like.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/xx9uz8/influencersbrands_endorsing_gonzaga_sisters_will/,6 10 2022

Lucky Me Curly Spaghetti,"on the topic of noodles, this got my emotions on a rollercoaster. dati when i was in grade school, maggi's instant spaghetti noodle have a special place in my heart on how tasty it was. nung nawala nalang sya sa stores, i was hugely disappointed and turned to lucky me spaghetti. i didn't like lm's taste as a kid so the instant spaghetti craze of my kid self went away. as an adult, i did adjusted with lm's spaghetti, midnight snack and merienda, right? oks sya and delish for a 17php srp spaghetti. up until around the late months of 2021. nawala ang lm's spag bigla sa any groceries i went to and i was just miserable in every store i don't see the noodle anymore. i thought to myself maybe what happened to maggi happened to lm as well and i grieved the loss. (medyo oa pero idk it's not an occasional snack pero it's something i weirdly held with me?? lol) later april this year i had the thought to search the instant spag on shopee and i got happily surprised na meron papala? pero iba na packaging. excited kong binili and what the hell? hahahaha sobrang nipis ng noodles!! ginawa nilang abot kaya yung presyo around 8-12php i can't remember clearly pero ayon. same taste, but the quality of the noodles is kinda ewan ko nakakadiri? feeling ko ngumunguya ako ng mga worms na itsurang worms ng mga pusa ko pag dinedeworm ko sila kasi puti sya at sobrang nipis hahaha. i bought like 10 pieces, i still love the taste. pero the noodle thinness and texture is slowly turning me off. the price adjustment made the product suffer and i'm just sadly eating my spag noodles now while i type this away. i love making any types of noodles, red sauce or white sauce with any type of meats and seafood. it's delish, and i can't get enough of them. pero i guess instant spaghetti holds a special place in my heart that's slowly fading away. kahit panakip butas lang sya sa gutom ko pag medyo low on finances. thanks for coming to my tedtalk!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ujtam0/lucky_me_curly_spaghetti/,6 05 2022

A close encounter with COVID-19.,"guys, just want to share my personal experience. do not let your guard down even with friends or relatives, especially if you have elderly, children or sickly family members. the short story is that i have three siblings, girls ages 17 (twins) and 12, who have been staying with me for more than a year and a half now because our mom is sumakabilang bahay. their dad died in 2017. i have another brother from the same mother, he is 18 years old recently graduated from senior high. i did not take him in cause of a few reasons. one, i have an ate 30 and another brother who is 22 who are capable of taking him in. i already have three girls with me and it's more than what i can handle already. second, i know he can't be contained meaning lakwatsero so he's a real risk for us especially that i have a baby aged 1 and a half. three, he's annoying. however, recently, naawa ako. i am usually mataray and masungit sa kanya, just to push him away. i am a realy push over and minsan hindi ako makatiis so this is how i cope with it na i pretend to be masama, mataray and masungit so people won't ask me for favors. august, naawa ako sa kanya and he really has no place to say. my brother and sister who were supposed to take him in, both are selfish in their own right, all in all walang kwenta. so i let him stay. he has a bike so sideline niya is delivery so i let him. i also have a bike and i also deliver my selling goods so i know to just disinfect, keep your distance and minimal contact. i let him stay at our house, he's staying at the part of our living room that nobody goes to and is right infront of our other door for entrance. for the rest, yes, he's using our utensils, bathroom, kitchen, etc. this was a big mistake for me. come his birthday, end of august, i bought him some food and a cake and after that he ate and run. i said, if you're leaving this house, you're not coming back. he said yes. i told him good. but then, my fiance, also a big push over, opened the door when my brother knocked. i told him, why did you let him in? he said well nakakaawa. i said my sister should be responsible in finding a place for him, not us and he said just let him stay it's okay with me. so i did. after three days, nawalan ng panlasa. i knew it, he threw his friends a birthday party and probably they were drinking. i said get out of this house and get picked up by the barangay elsewhere. he asked me what he should do, i said i already told you what to do. i told you to stay indoors right? now, i don't care just leave. i have young siblings here, i have a baby, my fiance is very sickly since he was a kid, i have my step mother who has asthma and is very sick, we have a tenant upstairs who has a baby as well. my sister also called and i told her i told you. why did you let him stay here with us when you know we are at risk. she claimed that she did not know that he was staying here. we disinfected the entire house. i threw out his clothes to the garage and everything he had used. we used up all the chlorine and alcohol that we had. even doing that felt pointless. we were already exposed. we used the same utensils, we used the same door handles, the same bathroom, he touched the refrigirator, the dining table and chairs, everything. all i can do was pray. after 8 days, he tested positive for covid. he currently remains asymptomatic aside for the loss of senses such as taste and smell. we did not get any tests done because none of us experienced any symptoms. it's been more than 15 days since. we are all fine. but the entire time, i was really... mad. for his birthday, he put other people at risk, his own family. i threw him a small birthday party and it was not enough for him. i said, he could have lived with me until the end of the pandemic and i would not mind. he could have ate and slept here for free but he chose to have a good time with his friends in exchange for our health and safety. guys, don't let anyone into your home. do not feel safe, not even with your own family. this was a close call. i will never put my family at risk again just because i feel like i am selfish by not letting someone in. it's been 20 days since and we are healthy and fine. even my father, my step mother, my other siblings, my in laws who were exposed because they visited while my brother was still here, our tenants. no one got sick. i would not know what to do if we contracted covid-19. it was an excruciating two weeks for me, not knowing what is going to happen.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/itfju1/a_close_encounter_with_covid19/,15 09 2020

Philippines was a taste of heaven -From a Filipino teen who grew up in The US,"17 here, born in the philippines, and moved to the us when i was 8. as a child you hear all these amazing things about the us, so i looked forward to it. but ever since i arrived in the us, i’ve been homesick ever since. a couple weeks ago, my lola passed away, which prompted my family to go. something which my parents never had any desire to do so. i must say, walking in my hometown was a beautiful taste of nostalgia. i saw my relatives, and especially my cousins. i love how all the people there are in one place. whilst in the us, i have no cousins near me. i loved seeing everyone there look like me, and to hear everyone speak your mother tongue. physically, it was uncomfortable, such as the heat, and the bugs. but it filled my soul with happiness. i feel that my life in the us, is monotonous. for years, i was always jealous whenever my uncle would visit home. my parents always said that i would hate it. they were wrong, i was happy. now i’m back the us, the same repetitive cycle day by day. life here is grey. being in the philippines made me realize how much i missed out. how different would my bond with my cousins would be? seeing them so close with each other honestly made me jealous. staying in the philippines, would also mean i had more time to spend with my lola. although i can speak the language (because i was 8 when i left) and i ordered food in filipino, they always replied back in english. it made me realize how white washed i am. i miss my language, i miss my family, i miss my home. as soon as i can get money, i’m going back. i’m willing to trade the life i have in the us for a new life in the philippines. edit. when we moved 9+ years ago, i promised to myself that i wouldn’t let being in the us change me. but it did, i just want to feel reconnected in my culture again. i thought i assimilated perfectly, i can’t even hear the so-called american accent my cousins say i have when i speak filipino. i feel like i’m losing too much of my culture, and want to be a part of it again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/104329y/philippines_was_a_taste_of_heaven_from_a_filipino/,5 01 2023

"As a muslim who recently started eating pork, has pork always been like this?","may naamoy din ba kayong unpleasant everytime kumakain kayo ng baboy? as someone who is born a muslim, i've always abstained from eating pork. i've never been a devout muslim nor a firm believer of our religion but i do pray from time to time especially on certain religious occasions because i still believe that there is a god. it's been more than a year since i last prayed and that was when i was still living in my home province. i recently moved out to work at a city where majority of the population don't abstain from eating it. ever since i was a kid, people always asked me how it feels like not to be able to eat pork. there were even times that they would tell me how big i was missing out. and to be honest, i've always been curious as to what it really tasted like. i frequently come across food contents in social media showing varying dishes of it. oo, nakakalaway sya paminsan to the point that i was really curious if masarap ba talaga. it was last year when i started eating pork. it was during a special occasion in our firm where almost all meals served had pork in it. at first, i didn't know how to tell everyone that i don't eat pork and it felt like it would be a hassle for all of them na sila pa mag-aadjust para sakin. so as someone who was never really a devout practitioner of our religion, i said ""yeah sure, i'll try it tutal borderline atheist din naman ako eh"". so i did taste every meal na may pork without telling anyone that i was a muslim (on paper at least). and to my surprise, it wasn't that impressive. it's kinda meh. there are dishes that were ok but nothing really stood out even yung lechon (this is cebu ah). but one thing i noticed is that pork has this distinct smell/after-taste na sobrang nakaka turn-off. parang amoy tangkal especially yung mga crispy pata and ribs. i feel like i would need to put a lot of calamansi and pepper just to mask that smell/after-taste. i've asked my friends if same ba din ang case for them if may naaamoy din ba sila na unpleasant. almost all of them ang sagot is wala naman so i thought maybe it's just me kasi di ako sanay kumain ng baboy. until one day, a friend of mine (a christian) pointed out that pork has this unpleasant smell. he described it as amoy ""tangkal"". i immediately agreed kasi that's how i would describe it. i would also sometimes come across videos on social media where they would soak the meat in baking soda first before cooking it just to get rid of the ""porky smell"". so i started thinking na baka nga di lang ako nakakaamoy neto. kayo ba, do you sometimes experience the same?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/163gkw8/as_a_muslim_who_recently_started_eating_pork_has/,28 08 2023

(covid) is it just me?,"is it just me, or did my senses really dulled after having covid? i haven't fully researched on it, so i'm really sorry for my ignorance, but i wanted to ask first hand experiences from people who've had covid before. january 2021 i got covid, no fevers, no migraine, no body ache, but i lost my sense of smell, and the only taste i could taste was sweetness. even if i eat adobo, lemon, calamansi, suka; those tasted sweet to me. after a while, it went back but over time i've been noticing some differences like how i can't smell particular smells, unless i put it right below my nose. i used to have a very sensitive nose, and now, i could barely even smell myself, even if i go two or three days without showering (just to experiment), unless i put my clothes directly on my nose, or smell my armpits, and because of this, i have gotten very insecure about my body odor. i've always loved to cook and there were some cases where i can only taste a hint of spice i used on my dish, so now i have to ask my sister to always taste my dishes just to make sure it tastes the same as i always cooked it. has this happened to anyone else? i've heard some rumors, sure. can this be cured? or how can i make sure that my senses have really dulled?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/14ieoyu/covid_is_it_just_me/,25 06 2023

"My two cents on ""Hala! Tumaba/pumayat ka""","""hala! tumaba/pumayat ka"" is a phatic expression meant to signify one is in good health or warning that one is not eating enough. we have a generational gap where the previous two generations didn't have food security. our grandparents/parents literally starved to death during the marcos era. i am not saying that fat-shaming didn't exist during those time periods, though. i do not have the study to support such claims. nowadays, we have relatively better food security (i.e. not starving). gaining/losing weight is more or less caused by psychological health (anorexia, bed, etc) rather than economic constraints, not to mention the distress caused by its effects. i do think that painting the entire picture helps us better in explaining why calling someone out for their physique is counter-productive and detrimental to one's mental health and bridging the generational gap is a huge help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/vd9qzn/my_two_cents_on_hala_tumabapumayat_ka/,16 06 2022

On the Restriction of Video Gaming in the Philippines,"so i just saw in 24 oras last night about senator gatchalian wanting to [regulate](https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/scitech/technology/849874/gatchalian-wants-mtrcb-to-regulate-video-and-online-games/story/) the playing of video and online games. this isn't anything new as other countries have similar laws. what i don't agree to it is this. at least half of the friends play video games, and they're all decent and responsible people. for the record, i don't play video games and have never owned a console all my life, i prefer the outdoors but this thing needs to be said. i get it that this law is meant to target children who play games until in the early morning and neglect their studies and sleep. but, they fail to notice that video games are a form of escapism - a not so destructive one at that compared to other traditional vices such as smoking, gambling and alcohol. i remember a talk during an anime convention wayy back where some prominent toy collectors said that they're better off collecting toys and playing video games than doing more destructive vices like the ones i already said. my point here is this, those that play *too much* games are no different than alcoholics, chain smokers and gambling addicts - they all need help. the trick is not to just address the symptoms, but go for the root cause instead. if you know someone who has an addiction and know them through and through, chances are you know the troubles they're facing. in my insignificant and humble opinion, i think that games should remain unregulated, the same way that the sale of liquor is not limited - heck, you can buy an entire case of red horse and no one will bat an eye. let the people live a little, eh? it will become a problem when people become irresponsible, and intervention should be done more constructively than just forcing them to kick their habit, because chances are, they'll just replace it with another one. i was a kid in the 2000's and a lot of my childhood friends got their taste of alcohol and yosi at a young age and i'm not proud of that. today, a lot my child hood friends still smoke and drink and cannot kick the habit. kids today can play video games instead of these more destructive vices and i'd prefer that, it's a lesser evil. and besides, knowing how crafty and adaptable people are, they'll just find another vice to get addicted to if they ban these lesser evils. would the government rather have these kids smoke and drink rather than play games instead? everybody needs an escape. here's a parting thought, aside from video games, coffee and social media are two addictions that are socially acceptable and yet, we don't hear the government calling for actions to restrict access to them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ykl0zy/on_the_restriction_of_video_gaming_in_the/,2 11 2022
I made a story called “Corruption” but it was removed from the subreddit I posted it on. Maybe some people might enjoy this.,"i know what you’re going to say, a lot of countries in the world are corrupt but let me tell you, my country is different. i was born here, i never left and i would probably die in this forsaken land. i just need someone to listen to my story before it’s too late. these are all documented by the way and i included links. i’m a journalist, i cover crime stories and it all started when we elected a new president in 2016. there was discontent with the people and everyone wanted change so the majority voted for a politician from a small town, known for his strict, iron-fisted leadership. he won and kept his promise of eradicating drug kingpins. people applauded him for that. never minding the [bodies](https://time.com/philippines-drug-war/) that piled up. i’d go out and cover stories of people being found lifeless in the middle of the street with a signboard hung on their necks that says [“do not imitate. i am a drug pusher.”](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/825678/story-in-numbers-war-on-drugs) it wasn’t shocking at first, but then it happened monthly, then weekly and finally, night after night. i just kept on covering them but something was really fishy. no autopsies were done to the bodies and the people i interviewed had the same narrative. they were either intimidated or were just paid off to say nothing to anyone, afraid for their lives. all of the victims came from [poor households](https://www.amnesty.org.uk/philippines-president-duterte-war-on-drugs-thousands-killed), none of them were drug lords. then [a kid was killed](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-46381697 ) and the officials told everyone that the kid was a drug runner. i can only stand there and watch as the child’s mother wailed when she found her son’s lifeless body. she cried and told us how her son was a good kid and how he loved his family. so i investigated the shit out this and then covid happened, i was stalled. the issue quieted down and people went on with their lives waiting for the vaccine. i was one of the frontliners who received the vaccine early so i continued to investigate quietly. i followed the police and of course, it was like a movie, scripted on how they go about their organized raids of the slums, and how they don’t really hurt anyone who isn’t involved in drugs. so one night, i didn’t follow the official group of the raids, i found this informant who told me that something’s going to happen at a certain place and time. i went there and hid behind the trash, waiting for the police shootout. i was alone, then i noticed the cats and the rats running away from where i was. i saw a group of kids running, hurrying to get to their homes. there was this wooshing sound, i thought it was going to rain, but man, was i wrong. [some kind of creature](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/aswang) arrived, i can’t describe it clearly but it was humanoid with skin covered wings, it smelled foul and it had long sharp nails, it looked like a demon with disheveled hair and grotesque face with red eyes, and it fuckin’ landed in front of me and snatched a child. i can’t tell you what it did with the child but all i can say is that it was brutal and there were lots of blood. i was paralyzed and scared. i mean, how can i defend that child? i only have a fucking camera and a phone. so i just kept silent and snapped some pictures. then it transformed into a person which was more horrifying than the monster that it was. i knew him. i don’t know if anyone will believe me but my informant gave me more time and places where he said something was going to happen and something did happen. the monster wore different faces when it transformed into human but those faces belonged to one family and that family is fucking prominent because their [patriarch](https://youtu.be/h3an7mcyoa4) was [a former president](https://youtu.be/vrdjg4elvju) of my country who became a [dictator](https://youtu.be/svwnnhjhdkc) around 50-something years ago. these people are evil and i think they are able to get into the minds of feeble minded folks, maybe that’s why they can manipulate the masses to believe them. we held the elections a couple of months ago and his son won. before the elections, the previous president said that this guy isn’t brilliant but his daughter ran for the [vp position](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2022/05/10/2179985/sara-no-hard-feelings-over-dads-non-endorsement-bbm/) alongside that guy. he’s very [powerful](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/watch/undercover-asia/the-troll-army-2844151), [he has trolls](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-54275891) guarding the internet and social media, and these are documented in the news but people still believe him. those who come out and state documented facts which are against that family are being [red tagged, killed, or sometimes they just disappear.](https://youtu.be/zrbmgsu4ih0) it’s happening again, the media is being [silenced](https://youtu.be/jqpjfwv_p6e) just like [before](https://mobile.twitter.com/howardrjohnson/status/1553562174211198976). not only did they [steal](https://youtu.be/5gnujhs-gho) the country’s money, they also [robbed](https://youtu.be/5gnujhs-gho) innocent lives. i have a family and i’m afraid for their lives. so i’m writing this today to tell you the truth. i’m going to post the photos and videos soon but i doubt anyone will believe me. i’m taking my family to a safe place because i believe worse things are going to happen and i know the worst is going to happen to me. i remember what the [martial law victims](https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/182828-marcos-dictatorship-martial-law-youth-leaders-killed/) said, how they were [tortured](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/04/five-things-to-know-about-martial-law-in-the-philippines/) by the police and the military. what more if that family finds out that i know their secret. i’m spending the last days of my life with the people i love. i’m agnostic but if you have have a god, please pray for me and for my country.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/wcugz0/i_made_a_story_called_corruption_but_it_was/,31 07 2022
Ivermectin Thread,"i've noticed how the recent stuff on ivermectin have been dividing the people. the most common phrase i hear against it would be: ""it's for dogs."" (despite the ones for it referring to its human grade variant.) for those for it, the phrase would be: ""it's been used for 20 years already."" &#x200b; as a result, i've done some compiling for both sides of the story. i was expecting deaths from the human grade use, but i was surprised with the lack of news related to it. i'm pretty much split on the effectiveness of human-grade ivermectin against the virus, but it was used to treat some diseases over the last 20 years. i was ready to dismiss it anyway until i've noticed how hell-bent the pma and doh are in quelling ""disinformation"" on the use of ivermectin- readily stating that it's mainly used for dogs (ignoring the human grade variant again.) i would be willing to believe them had it not for the doh's history of corruption and the pma's stance on dengvaxia back in 2019 when it was supported by the who. &#x200b; it's these kinds of wordplay that makes me think this isn't about the ""safety of the filipino people"". rather, this is more on the money you could milk from them. on average, a single covid-19 patient could net up to php 240,000.00 with how expensive treatment is. the vaccines also sell for hefty amounts (heck, i won't be surprised if the sinovac ""donation"" is payment for the reef they're occupying atm) when compared to ivermectin, which is priced at around php 35.00 - php 40.00 a dose, and only needs one per two weeks. again, while i'm not for the use of ivermectin, i'm not exactly against it either since that depends on the masses if they want to use it or not. &#x200b; so why are they adding tons of red tape and outright discouraging the use? and why would businessmen support the use of ivermectin if they won't even gain much from it when we look at things from a business standpoint? countries like slovakia and places like latin america had already approved its use, and ivermectin itself was approved for human consumption for 20+ years at this point. you can label me as a conspiracy theorist or whatever, but these are simply questions of a concerned citizen. &#x200b; &#x200b; sources below \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ &#x200b; cdcph joint press conference on early treatment protocol as new direction to address the pandemic screenshots: [https://imgur.com/gallery/qowjqwr](https://imgur.com/gallery/qowjqwr) &#x200b; 2 local pharma firms eye production of ivermectin: [https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1135343](https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1135343) &#x200b; businessmen ask gov't to consider ivermectin for covid-19 treatment: [https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1413488/businessmen-ask-govt-to-consider-ivermectin-for-covid-19-treatment](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1413488/businessmen-ask-govt-to-consider-ivermectin-for-covid-19-treatment) &#x200b; ivermectin for humans must be registered with fda before use: [https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/03/28/21/ivermectin-for-humans-must-be-registered-with-fda-before-use-official](https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/03/28/21/ivermectin-for-humans-must-be-registered-with-fda-before-use-official) &#x200b; ivermectin 20 years on: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16126457/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16126457/) &#x200b; [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17075336/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17075336/) &#x200b; [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3043740/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3043740/) &#x200b; [https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/ivermectin-oral-route/proper-use/drg-20064397](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/ivermectin-oral-route/proper-use/drg-20064397) &#x200b; since october: [https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/covid-19-race-for-cure-vaccine-part-one](https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/covid-19-race-for-cure-vaccine-part-one) &#x200b; pma against use and plays with words: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdau-r8z7xy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdau-r8z7xy) &#x200b; [https://www.rappler.com/nation/department-health-food-drug-administration-warnings-against-ivermectin-covid-19-treatment](https://www.rappler.com/nation/department-health-food-drug-administration-warnings-against-ivermectin-covid-19-treatment) &#x200b; pma supports dengvaxia: [https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1159662/philippine-medical-association-bats-for-dengvaxia-use](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1159662/philippine-medical-association-bats-for-dengvaxia-use) &#x200b; [https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2019/09/01/1948097/pma-supports-restoration-dengvaxia-registration](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2019/09/01/1948097/pma-supports-restoration-dengvaxia-registration) &#x200b; [https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/706419/pma-backs-who-recommendation-on-use-of-dengue-vaccine-amid-rise-in-cases/story/](https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/706419/pma-backs-who-recommendation-on-use-of-dengue-vaccine-amid-rise-in-cases/story/) &#x200b; doh corruption: [https://www.rappler.com/nation/gordon-gets-duque-admit-corruption-department-health](https://www.rappler.com/nation/gordon-gets-duque-admit-corruption-department-health) &#x200b; [https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1323799/poe-says-duque-failed-miserably-in-leading-doh-philhealth](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1323799/poe-says-duque-failed-miserably-in-leading-doh-philhealth) &#x200b; [https://manilastandard.net/news/top-stories/338102/ombudsman-suspends-8-philhealth-5-doh-execs-over-fund-issues.html](https://manilastandard.net/news/top-stories/338102/ombudsman-suspends-8-philhealth-5-doh-execs-over-fund-issues.html) &#x200b; current debt on vaccines: [https://www.rappler.com/business/things-to-know-philippines-covid-19-loans](https://www.rappler.com/business/things-to-know-philippines-covid-19-loans)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/mhjvuh/ivermectin_thread/,1 04 2021

(we are not the ones you’re looking for, sir. don’t kill us.) the men wore black. their shoes were black. their pants were black. their jackets were black. their faces were covered by black bonnetts, with holes big enough only for them to see, smell, and speak. their guns were black, too. vivian’s words did nothing to stop the men. one walked straight to the dozing adrian and kicked him conscious, pointed a pistol to his head, and shot him three times. the men left as vivian and her children wept. but it wasn’t over. the men returned, walking straight to vivian. lovely knew what was coming. she was barely four feet tall, the intruders three heads taller than her, but with her father studded with bullets, at that moment, she wanted to kill. heat rising in her chest, she stood between the men and her mother. “putangina ’nyo! ang kakapal ng mukha ’nyo! wala kayong awa!” lovely screamed as she shed tears. (you motherfuckers! how dare you? you have no mercy!) vivian reached out again with the same piece of paper that failed to save her husband – a certificate. it was proof that, just the month before, drug suspects like adrian, a tricycle driver, and herself, a manicurist, had surrendered to local officials for rehabilitation. they promised they would change for the better, and, in exchange, they would be given immunity from execution – or so they thought. it was a month into the presidency of rodrigo duterte, when at the peak of his so-called war on drugs dozens were being killed daily by policemen and vigilantes. their targets were the same: drug suspects. duterte wove a tale about them being the source of all ills in the country. declaring all drug users as addicts just the same, duterte once said he would be “happy to slaughter” them all – as adolf hitler did with the jews. “please don’t. that’s my daughter. this is our document, proof that we have surrendered,” vivian continued to explain. “we don’t need that, what we need is both of you,” the man answered. what the man meant was they needed her partner and herself dead. a shot to vivian’s arm. lovely charged forward, forcing her mother back. the gunman locked his gun to lovely’s head. “don’t. she’s a child,” a voice warned from behind the shooter. vivian pulled lovely behind her and dropped to her knees. she begged them to stop. lovely hoped the man would listen, to find it in himself to see what was in front of him – a defenseless woman with her defenseless child, trembling. the man still shot her mother in the head. “duterte kami,” they said, as they walked out. “we are duterte.” a generation of victims adrian breathed. it looked like he wanted to say something to lovely. she walked closer, tried to string his moans into words. before she could make sense of them, blood choked her father, then he completely fell silent. she turned to her mother and tried to cradle her lifeless body. as she propped her up, lovely’s small hand went through the back of her mother’s head. her skull had been shattered. lovely’s parents would be among the first victims in duterte’s anti-drug campaign, which has since killed at least 7,000 drug suspects in police operations as of january 2022. killings by vigilantes inspired by duterte included, the number of fatalities hovered at around 30,000 as of 2019, according to human rights groups. the number has risen since then. lovely would be among the first of many – one child in a generation who lost either their father or mother, and in lovely’s case, both, to gunmen who left as quickly as they came. finding the killers lovely swore the killers of her parents were policemen. the damning evidence was the piece of paper one of them carried to their home. she said it was a warrant. over a week later, police knocked on their doors with news. good news, they said. the police found adrian and vivian’s killer. then, they killed him. on the evening of september 1, 2016, a certain restituto romero was shot dead in san vicente street in caloocan city. police rushed to the crime scene and found a witness. the killer was a man riding a red, white, and black honda wave. he wore black. the officers on the scene radioed the rundown to their city-wide communications line. minutes later, they found him, whizzing on his motorbike through bagong silang, near caloocan’s boundary with the province of bulacan. the intercepting police team was led by then-colonel reydante ariza, the highest-ranking policeman on the night shift. they signaled the rider to stop, but he only hit the turbo. the chase led to a shootout, which led to the death of the killer. investigator rhyan rodriguez remembered that night. it was already over when he arrived, the killer already cold. his job mostly involved writing down what he saw. he noted the date and time, their location, where the bullets landed, where the motorcycle fell, how the killer spread on the street, and how the scene of the crime operatives (soco) unmasked the killer – helmet first, bonnet next. he stopped writing. it was a familiar face. a cop. elpidio manding was a policeman from caloocan city. he was over a decade ahead of rodriguez in the service, so ahead that when the investigator was still a student, that cop was already elpidio manding of the caloocan city police office. “organic” was how rodriguez described him, a policeman who was assigned to his own hometown, bound there until he retired. but manding was a nuisance case. by the time he allegedly shot it out with his superiors, he had been labeled awol. he stopped showing up, and word in the caloocan police headquarters was that he ditched the badge for a more lucrative job at a security agency. the soco extracted a gun, a packet of shabu (methamphetamine), then they found a piece of paper. it was a list of names. rodriguez knew some of them. there was restituto romero, who was killed the same day. then, there was adrian peregrino and vivian ramos. the piece of paper that lovely saw was a kill list. how probes die rodriguez was the same investigator in the killing of adrian and vivian. with manding found and killed, he declared the case solved. rodriguez’s reasoning was simple: manding matched the description of witnesses in the killing of adrian and vivian – a man clad in black riding a motorcycle – and the victims’ names appeared on his kill list. who else would kill the couple? in lovely’s memory, she did not count only one man who killed her parents, she counted six: two men barged into their house, while four men stood guard outside. for lovely, there would only be justice when all of the men – the killer and his accomplices – were captured. she also wanted them killed. but the police did nothing more. rodriguez did not interview lovely nor her siblings. all his witnesses were outside when the double murder happened. rodriguez conceded one thing: that there was more than one killer. his witnesses confirmed that two men intruded. but, five years later, that one killer was still at large. even with manding being an awol police officer, rodriguez did not probe into the possibility that manding’s accomplice was a policeman too. despite all this, the case was still branded as solved and shelved. this was how the investigation turned cold. in 2016, when the war on drugs was at its peak, people died by the dozen per day. in caloocan city alone, rodriguez counted at least five a night. rodriguez knew because he was one of only two homicide investigators manning the night shift. before he could make progress with one killing, another would follow not long after. “even if we wanted to probe more, we couldn’t do it, given the number of cases there were. it was the peak of the killings,” rodriguez said in filipino. caloocan continued to be a killing field. it was in the same city that three minors were killed in a span of two months in 2017. the police’s credibility plummeted so much that the metro manila police chief then, oscar albayalde, decided to fire all caloocan cops in september 2017. rodriguez was one of them. rodriguez turned over his case folders to an investigator who had no experience in caloocan. he couldn’t even remember his name. rodriguez was only reassigned to caloocan in late 2018, and he no longer probed into the death of lovely’s parents. “kasi meron nang nahuling isa,” rodriguez said. (because one was already captured.) by the internal standards of the philippine national police, if one suspect in a case is captured or killed, the case is considered solved. in the philippines, there can be 20 killers in a case, with only one of them captured, yet the police can still declare it solved – a death sentence to the probe. “the painful reality is, old cases get buried by new ones. it’s the new ones that get the priority,” rodriguez said. the case of lovely’s parents could still be reopened, but it would take the caloocan police the will and resources to listen to lovely, who was still a minor. lovely would also have to trust the police with the case, which to her, was impossible. a child dreams five years passed. lovely turned 16. she lived with her aunt marichu, vivian’s youngest sister, in a house not more than 50 meters from where her parents were killed. the home’s door was made of metal, engraved with the outline of a rosary. right above it, pressed in all capital letters, was one word: family. they were 12 in the house, with lovely still the eldest child. vivian and adrian were with them, ashes in urns they kept above their cabinets. in lovely’s dreams, she saw them alive, flesh and bone. lovely wanted to follow them, to stay with them longer. – rappler.com",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/s9d0zf/she_saw_6_men_murder_her_parents_the_cops_killed/,21 01 2022

"Adobo, sisig among ‘100 Best Dishes in the World’ of 2021 ranked by Taste Atlas","adobo, sisig among ‘100 best dishes in the world’ of 2021 ranked by taste atlas dec 26, 2021 3:16 pm pht steph arnaldo manila, philippines – it’s no surprise that adobo and sisig continue to be globally recognized – and as they should be! international food database taste atlas has included the two well-loved filipino dishes on their annual 100 best dishes in the world list for 2021. adobo (4.3 stars) came in 81st place, beating france’s fondue savoyarde in 85th place, china’s kung pao chicken in 86th, and italy’s puttanesca, which was in 92nd place. taste atlas mentioned that the one of the “best adobo” can be found in manila’s cafe adriatico. they also described the salty-sour meat staple as the “closest thing to a national dish in the philippines,” consisting of browned chunks of meat (usually pork and/or chicken, sometimes seafood), mixed with white vinegar, soy sauce, bay leaves, garlic, salt, sugar, oil, and black pepper. “the combination of these ingredients is left to simmer over low heat, resulting in succulent, juicy, and tender ingredients covered in thick, rich, and savory sauce. adobo got its name from the spanish word adobar, meaning marinade or pickling sauce,” taste atlas wrote, also nothing that there are a number of varieties of the dish – from spicy, mild, to saucy, or dry versions. additional ingredients can also be added, such as onions, ginger, lemongrass, chili peppers, atsuete, and/or coconut milk. pampanga’s famous traditional dish, sisig (4.4 stars), also made it in 72nd place, coming in right after malaysia’s laksa and beating india’s butter chicken at 78th place. taste atlas recommended aling lucing’s sisig in angeles, pampanga. the pulutan favorite is typically made by boiling, chopping, and grilling parts of a pig’s head (ears, cheeks, and jowls) and seasoning them with salt, pepper, vinegar, and other spices. the meat is combined with fried onions, chili pepper, and sometimes chicken liver, and then traditionally topped with a raw egg and served on a sizzling plate. sometimes, mayonnaise or crunchy pork chicharon are added on top for extra texture and flavor. “originally, sisig had no meat in it, and was first described in a 1732 kapampangan dictionary by fr. diego bergano as a salad consisting of guava or green papaya. the name of the dish is believed to derive from the word sisigan, meaning to make sour. it was used as an early remedy for nausea and hangovers, because its sour flavor was considered a vomit suppressant,” taste atlas wrote. rounding out the top 100 list is indonesia’s satay in 99th place and japan’s tonkatsu in last. spain’s gambas al ajillo is in 6th place, while the top five dishes for this year are italy’s trofie al pesto, thailand’s massaman curry, poland’s pierogi ruskie, brazil’s picanha, and mexico’s cochinita pibil in first place. on saturday, december 25, taste atlas included lechon, bibingka, kesong puti, and lugaw in their top 100 most popular christmas dishes around the world. filipino savory-sour soup sinigang was deemed the world’s best vegetable soup in august, with a rating of 4.8 stars out of 5. in march 2019, kare-kare, lechon, and crispy pata found their places on taste atlas’ top 100 best traditional dishes in the world list of the year. taste atlas is an online gastronomic database that promotes the local culinary culture of countries all over the world. the website contains over 10,000 specialty dishes, drinks, recommended restaurants, and local ingredients for anyone to check out before an international trip. – rappler.com",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/rp0zfh/adobo_sisig_among_100_best_dishes_in_the_world_of/,26 12 2021

Worst or most memorable experiences while riding UV Express?,"honestly curious sa mga experiences niyo while riding the uv express vans. and might as well share mine na rin, hehe. psa: pasintabi po sa mga kumakain (you might wanna scroll past this one, haha). super traumatizing, i still remember the smell to this day. i was in my 3rd year of college and otw back to alabang from my uni (since long weekend ata nung time na toh). merong mag-jowa na nakaupo sa may waiting area and idk pero may something odd kasi kay ate girl. like she was acting strange for some reason but i decided to leave her be. also, for about 30 minutes before we left the terminal, super landi nilang dalawa (as in can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other type of landi) and at some points in the corner of my eye i noticed na nag-ffull on momol sesh sila, lol. anyway, since puno na yung seats we were preparing na to leave. umakyat na rin si girl & guy (sa harap sila umupo, which later on i was incredibly thankful for). during the entire ride they were super loud and overly affectionate pa rin but oh well. everyone was too tired to care anyway. but when we were about 20 minutes from molito, si ate girl she suddenly pulls away from the guy and covers her mouth with both hands, then *projectile vomits* all over the entire front row. i remember it splashing all over the windshield. i think some of the splash rebound went kay kuya driver huhu, and some to her boyfriend. sobrang unexpected lang talaga since barely a minute ago they were all up each other's face doing god-knows-what. i was sitting directly behind them but thank god we weren't within the splash zone + buti na lang may box of tissues si kuya driver (but i think at this point it really wasn't much help na since it was dripping everywhere anyway). i've seen a few people throw up/get nauseous in transpo before but nothing like this one. you could tell din na spaghetti yung lunch niya that day huhu (i did not eat spaghetti for the next 6 months following this incident). i think all of us in the van held our reactions in because we didn't want them to feel bad. pero grabe huhu, the smell was definitely one to remember. took this as a lesson na lang, ever since then i started bringing white flower oil or vicks inhalers with me whenever i rode the uv express. decided to bring some of those small foldable vomit bags from airplanes as well just in case. you never really know when they could come in handy. is this a common occurrence? has anybody witnessed something similar? feel free to share any memorable events you have encountered while riding mga uv vans (or any public transport vehicle for that matter)!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/189xfpw/worst_or_most_memorable_experiences_while_riding/,3 12 2023

Imaging diagnostic for suspected obstruction in cats?,"hi. let me begin by sharing with you a brief history of my cats medical condition. i have 2 year old cat, her name is bronya (because i love honkai impact). for around a month, she has been experiencing diarrhea and is noticeably lethargic and sometimes even vomit. trying to be a responsible owner i have visited multiple animal clinics in qc for several times to have her treated. luckily, she recovered from her diarrhea but i started to notice her stools become a bit pencil shaped and thin. she also begins to rapidly lose weight and refuses to eat. a cousin from mine who lives abroad who also happens to be a vet suspects that this might have something to do with an obstruction in my cat's gastrointestinal tract and told me that if possible, i bring her to the nearest facility and have this be checked. one clinic i visited told me that she needs to have an x ray of her abdomen, but since their technician wasn't there at the time, i was advised to go back the next day. but when i came back, there was another vet (apparently an associate in the same clinic) who told me that she needs and ultrasound instead? so my question is, what should be used whenever the case is similar to my cat above? does anyone here have the same experience? i really don't want to waste resources as i'm on a budget but i can't let a loved one suffer any longer because of confusion. any feedback is deeply appreciated 😔",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/xqvuz9/imaging_diagnostic_for_suspected_obstruction_in/,29 09 2022
Need help! Covid-19 Patient in PGH,"peeps, need your help. anyone here from pgh? tldr at the end. i just wanted to check, a relative was diagnosed as a covid-19 positive patient. as a precautionary measure, upon knowing the result we had the patient rushed to the hospital. currently, he is in pgh and is an ""blue"" color coded area. my questions are: 1. what is a blue coded area? does the color blue refer to the severity of one's case or just a simple color coding for ease of reference. from what i understood, the blue area is a ward wherein 10 patients are kept together. the patient is of senior age and has chronic disease. patient has no fever. vomits phlegm frequently (sorry tmi) he does not have the appetite to eat. patient can breathe by himself, though oxygen saturation is at 70s. oxygen is provided to him. burning sensation at the throat area (we think this is due from vomiting). 2. what are the chances for a covid-19 patient in pgh to be assigned a private room? is this possible? we wanted private room at least there will be less exposure to other patients. 3. how can we get updates about the patient? what pgh has told us is that someone from their end will call and update us. this makes us anxious. like how often are we going to get updates? daily? weekly? case to case? another option is to have someone wait within the confines of the hospital and personally ask the nurses station for update (which i think negates the principle of distancing yourself in covid hotspot areas). will it help if we know someone who works at pgh?! so far, we have no contacts yet but we're still asking around. if anyone knows or can help us on this regard, we will be forever indebted to you. thank you reddit fam and if it's not asking too much, a prayer, a thought for all the covid patients and caregivers' safety. please stay at home, kung lalabas make sure to take all precautionary measures habang asa labas at paguwi ng bahay. maigi ng labis ang pagiingat kesa sa kulang. tl;dr: a senior patient is rushed in pgh due to covid. wanted to know: 1) can a patient get a private bedroom? currently, he is in a ward with 10 patients. 2) how can we get frequent updates on the patient's status. nurse said we can go to pgh everytime we need an update or wait for them to inform us.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/hpynl1/need_help_covid19_patient_in_pgh/,12 07 2020

How did growing up in a toxic Pinoy family F you up as a person?,"warning: ed, verbal abuse, child abuse my grandparents are just as toxic as my parents. my mom and dad are a couple of spineless cowards. takot rin sila sa lolo't lola ko, kaya hindi nila kami ipinagtatanggol pag ""dinidisiplina"" kami. i am the first of three siblings and the only female. our family lived in our ancestral home because my mother was my lolo and lola's favorite daughter. growing up in the 90s, my lolo and lola always found food and mealtime as the best means to punish me with. at around four years old to 8, talagang may kahinaan ako kumain. my lolo would always be the one to serve me food. sa akin niya lang ito ginagawa. every time ang dami niyang ilalagay sa plato ko na combination of kanin mixed with whatever viand we're having na halos an inch a way na lang from the edge of the plate sa sobrang dami. as in, itsura pa lang, nalulunod na ako. he would sit across me from the dining table and watch me like a hawk during meal time. he would remind me ever so often to take a bite. ""putang ina. wag mo tungangaan yan. sumubo ka!"", ""wag mo susuhin 'yang pagkain mo! lulunin mo yan!"", ""ano? kakain ka, o isusubsob kita sa pagkain mo na parang aso?"" some nights, nagwawala siya pag di ako makalampas sa tatlong subo. may isang beses na pinagbabasag niya yung plato ko't baso habang nagsisisigaw. tumigil rin kumain yung buong pamilya kasi nalagyan ng mga bubog yung pagkain namin. i remember crying myself to sleep that night nang hindi na nakapaligo pa sa sobrang takot. whenever i cannot finish my meal which is almost every meal, every day, paparusahan ako. the parusa can range from having rights, privileges and my favorite things taken from me. from no tv especially on weekends, my fave books get taken away as well as my toys bawal ko rin hawakan at kalaruin yung aso namin kung di, papaluin ng lolo ko yung aso para pati daw yung alaga ko ""magtanda"". (anong kinalaman nung aso sa di ko pagkain? bakit siya dapat magtanda!?) sometimes my fave toy at the moment gets placed in the middle of the dining table and i only get to touch it if i finish my meal. since hindi ko nga kaya , i usually just bid these toys goodbye. (yung isa kong polly pocket, nakuha ko na at 12 ish years old. na-outgrow ko na siya.) so, to remedy this i worked on being able to eat. then, i gained weight around my pre-teens given the amount of rice i was supposed to finish daily, my lola started taking over out of the blue. all she did was bully me whenever we're eating. especially pag may ibang tao like if we have guests or we're eating out. she would yell things at me. stuff like :""non-stop talaga yang bunganga mong putang ina ka noh? kaya ka lumolobo eh."" one time my uncle winced and called her out when he heard her say ""anlaki-laki ng ng tiyan mo, panay saksak mo pa rin ng pagkain sa muka mong tang ina ka."" when we were out sa grocery, she woud shame me sa mga sales people and sa cashier telling them na. ""lahat 'yan para dito lang sa elepante ko."" or when i would pick an item for myself she would scream out loud for other shoppers to hear na: ""sige! lamon! ang galing galing mo talaga pag dating sa pagpili ng lalamunin mo!"" and she would do this angrily. hindi passive agressive. as in galit at pasigaw. kaya super nakakahiya. when she's in a subtle mood. she would mockingly immitate the way i chew and would laugh calling me: "" babuy!"" or would sarcastically comment on my appearance pag halimbawa naka-ayos ako ""ganda mo, para kang palanggana."" she would also deny me of food at times. say for example she buys a box of donuts, ako lang ang di pwede kumuha. and at times, would accuse me of stealing food or treats at home only to find out na ang kumuha ay either of my brothers. my brothers would deliberately shield me and even so. sasabihin niya na tinakot ko daw yu g mga kapatid ko kaya pinagtatakpan ako. because of this, my brothers learned na magpaalam even for just a handful of m&ms para wag nila ako makitang pinagtitripan ng lola ko. and because i was just so over this treatment, nag diet naman ako. hindi ko namalayan na sumosobra na pala. it didn't help na in the 2000s the pro-ana-mia movement was in full swing. and the media was advocating for thinnes overall. the fashions at the time also favored slim frames. sick as it may seem, i found refuge in bingeing and purging. nakakain ko lahat ng gusto ko without having to gain weight. i also felt that i looked great in the latest trends at that time. i got hospitalized in 2007 for contracting a fatal gastrointentional infection which almost took me out because i was too weak to fight it. violent stomach upsets ba naman at vomitting and diarrhea ang primary symptoms. i weighed only 85lbs at 5ft. 3"". if it weren't for this infection, i wouldn't have been diagnosed with bulimia. it took a nutritionist, our family gastroenteroligist and my first psychiatrist and a couple of female professors na parang mommy figure ko sa school to help get me back to a healthy 115 lbs. i tried to work hard with them to get my life back. pero sa bahay, everything i went through was treated as nothing more than a physiological issue. walang may gusto mag address nung trauma which caused it all. they say, that's my psych's job. yung mommy ko naman, sinasabi niya na hindi niya maalala yung mga kinuwento ko sa inyo dito kanina. but she was always there when this happened. my brothers remember it too! mas naiiyak ako rito pag naiisip ko keysa sa mga pinagsasasabi sa akin ng lolo at lola ko. like, how can mom not remember? yun ba ang trauma response niya? selective amnesia? dahil ba hindi niya kakayanin kung di lilimutin ng utak niya as a form of defense? idk, pero parang mas nasasaktan ako doon. i feel so betrayed. in my 20's i got myself a career one na super minahal ko, pero sucked the soul out of me kasi very competitive and demanding. that time, i got back into bingeing and stopped seeing my psychiatrist and nutritionist all together. kasi, ako na ang magbabayad sa kanila eh. that time though, hindi na ako nagpupurge. i buried myself in work and sweets. before i know it i was gaining weight again. each time i get stressed, i will take my anger and frustration out on a whole cake, a tub of ice cream or makikipag inuman ako pero ang chaser ko 1.5 na coke at sa akin lang yun. donuts held a special place in my heart. kada may magbubukas na bagong donut shop, you can expect to see me falling in line to get a box! i also had candy in my pockets too. all. the. time! expensive candy or cheap candy is just the same to me. basta candy. i remember my psych said that my obsession with it had something to do with candy being the instrument my lola used as a ""trap"" nung bata ako. now, i am just all too happy na i wouldn't get in trouble for being able to access it as an adult. it didn't come as a surprise sa akin na lumobo ako, this time 3x from when i first gained weight as a preteen. i am full-on obese. where was my lolo and lola? nasa bahay pa rin. so, what i did to avoid them was that i left for work early and leave very late at night. i would even just chill with my boyfriend on weekends wag lang ako matambay sa bahay. from then on, i just lived every day as an obese woman. lahat ng milestones ko in life, i achieved as a fat woman. hindi sa proud ako. that's just what i am. severely depressed and fat -- but somehow unstoppable ma-achieve ang work goals ko. then, i had a very bad, unexpected mental breakdown in 2013. kaya i decided to see a new psychiatrist. i was then diagnosed with ptsd and my chronic depression was due to a hormonal imbalance pala. i got treated for the depression and ptsd. pero hirap ako maging physiologically healthy through food. no matter how much media i consume about living and eating healthy i can't seem to get it right. in 2017, i had a major fight with my lolo and finally ibinulalas ko na lahat ng hinanakit ko. pinagmumumura ko siya, at sinabihan rin ng masasakit na salita. i almost physically assaulted him, pero napigilan ako ng kapatid ko. he knew na siguradong mapapahamak ako if i were to lay a hand on my dirtbag of a lolo. jut imagine my obese ass hitting an 80 year old man. i knew that was the end of my stay at that house. lumayas ako nang walang pagdadalawang-isip and lived with my boyfriend just a month before our wedding. my brother helped me pack at siya ang naghatid sa akin. i never returned home. (my brothers were also theorizing na my lolo deliberately planned on riling me up para mag clash kami because i was about to have a big life event and he just felt like pissing on it. just like how all of a sudden, bigla siyang nagwala bago yung debut ko dati. one of my brothers also thought that kaya sa akin pinaka galit yung grandparents namin ay dahil daw, naging kaagaw nila ako sa attention ng mommy ko / anak nila mula nang ipanganak ako. yun ang sabi nila. ako? ewan ko! talagang hindi ko na lang siya kaya pagtimpian. all i feel is rage and contempt.) i saw my lolo again during my lola's funeral. she died 5 months after ko maglayas. namatay siya nang di kami nag uusap at galit ako sa kanya. when i heard the news i was the only one who had a hard time weeping for her. ff to now? i am living life in my mid 30s with maintenance meds for hypertension, borderline diabetis and chronic depression. but, there is a silver lining. i married a kind, understanding and gentle husband na hindi ako nagsasawang paalalahanan na walang parusa na naka abang sa akin pag hindi ko naubos ang pagkain ko. at, hindi ko na kailangan kainin ang feelings ko, dahil nandito siya para pakinggan ako nang walang paghuhusga. i have had so many doctors try to help me, but i believe that it is only he who is actually healing my inner child little by litte.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/10ijk65/how_did_growing_up_in_a_toxic_pinoy_family_f_you/,22 01 2023

My proposal is penalized individuals na lumabas na meron symptoms as a priority vs unvaccinated,"nanoticed ko na our government is now starting to punish individuals who are unvaccinated pero hindi ba ang unvaccinated ang dehado? they have the biggest risk right now if they go out, giving them more chances to get severe case of covid. pero tayong vaccinated, less chances of severe type of covid. not zero chance of covid. and everyone is still a potential carrier of the disease. pero i can see a lot of people working right now sa labas na may sipon at ubo. eto ung nakakaspread ng sakit pero no one is telling them sa bahay po muna kayo magquarantine kasi baka covid yan at nakakahawa. hindi ba mas dapat ipriority ito vs unvaccinated. or do a proper marketing sa pinas, if may sipon or ubo or trankaso, ok lang na di muna pumasok or wag ka na lumabas muna. ang sipon at ubo at pedeng makahawa ng iba, blah blah. alam ko turo ng mga magulang or prof natin dati, ubo sipon lang yan, kung sila nga mamatay na kayod parin para lang mabuhay or pumasok sa school etc. pero it's not the mentality na you are weak for not working or going to school but because you can be a carrier that can infect more people. edit: best explanation why we are encouraging vaccination to the unvax: https://www.reddit.com/r/philippines/comments/s3lvv3/my_proposal_is_penalized_individuals_na_lumabas/hslons9/ why providing sick leave is important and the current situation sa country natin why di mabigyan basta basta: https://www.reddit.com/r/philippines/comments/s3lvv3/my_proposal_is_penalized_individuals_na_lumabas/hsloul0/ also i want to clarify that i didn't post this to discourage people from getting vaccinated. get vaccinated if hindi ka pa vaccinated. this will prevent you from getting too sick or die from covid. magastos magkasakit. but the increase in numbers in covid right now isn't caused by the unvaccinated people but people who go out with symptoms (whether vaccinated or not vaccinated sila). we started to become too lenient and confident na basta bakunado ok na. it takes everyone to be considerate to not go out or not go to work physically if you are sick or has symptoms to prevent possible transmission of any type of viruses (whether if it's the regular flu or covid). yun ang gusto ko ipoint out dito.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/s3lvv3/my_proposal_is_penalized_individuals_na_lumabas/,14 01 2022

Ever wonder why random cellphone # miss call you?

(kasi i learned may iba nang volunteers na pumunta doon dati) - saan saan ka na nakapunta? (rallies) emphasis on ""idol"" when speaking about leni. they are in a mindset i'm doing this because i idolize a person. tapos curious sila aa merch ko sabi ko binili ko walang bayad ginagawa ko kampanya lang. sabi ko sa pasay lang ako umattend (so it's clear to them i'm not a rally hopper). i also said wala akong partida or grupo, sarili ko lang. i managed to steer the conversation to sumilao farmers. i told them i used to be apathetic/walang pake kung sinong pangulo dati (partly true, i was undecided until march just not bbm), tapos nagbago isip ko kasi sa story ng farmers. **not so good experience** one driver ask my age, if i'm married, and if i have a manliligaw then when he learned i'm single he's like ""sabi na nga"". i don't entirely consider this negative in a sense ganito talaga matatanda that they couldn't comprehend why some women marry late, pero i'm 80% sure they wouldn't ask the same question to a man. tapos yung mga nag ubos ng merch ko, paglayo nila nang-aasar ng ""wala kaming paki sa pangulo mo"" nq parinig saka i can overhear na ""bayad na 300 pesos umattend sa rally ni leni,"" at ""next week pag natalo kakabahan lahat yan."" when i walked near them they were suddenly silent. puro sila parinig pag malayo ako but they couldn't say it to my face. i chose not to engage na since i'm a lone woman saka it's like their baiting me with pang-aasar. **all in all** may iilang nakinig, kahit sexist pakikitungo sa akin, at least narinig nila yung kwento ng sumilao farmers. abonado merch, abonado oras, no regrets. hindi to for leni, para sa prinsipyo.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/uezuju/nag_jogging_ako_at_namigay_ng_lenikiko_merch_sa/,30 04 2022

Lianhua Qingwen capsules,"so nagreresearch ako tungkol dito sa supposed gamot sa covid. nung una ko nalaman to, may nagpadala sakin ng ""interview"" (advert) featuring benjamin abalos jr. miracle cure daw, uminom ng 12 capsules over 24 hrs then next day wala nang covid. tumawag ako dun sa contact ko sa mercury drug, nagsusupply daw sa kanila ng ilang boxes lang per week at ubos kaagad as soon as available. nalaman ko sa research ko na last year illegal pala sya idistribute ayon sa dangerous drugs board dahil sa ephedra, isang component na nilalagay sa ""magic weight loss pills"", nagcacause ng heart palpitations, high blood pressure, at irregular heartbeat. may nabasa din ako na sabi eh minamanage nya lang yung symptoms at hindi yung covid mismo, so parang over the counter cold medicine lang sya mixed with ephedra na bibigyan ka ng heart problems. pero late last year tinanggal sya sa list ng ddb, at binigyan ng approval ng fda. required pa rin ang approval ng doctor bago makabili, pero may nabibili online sa lazada, at syempre kung may kilala ka na may ""connections"". may nababalitaan ba kayo tungkol dun? may duda ako kasi unang nagpromote na narinig ko si abalos, tapos ngayon may video na minemention ni tulfo sa mga video nya.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/mkk34j/covid_cure_lianhua_qingwen_capsules/,5 04 2021
Animal Shelters and Online 'Limos',"naglipana na ang mga iba't ibang animal shelters online, and i think it's a good thing since it's a worthy cause. they post pictures of their beloved rescues, may it be dogs or cats. some even make memes out of them, but sometimes i can't help but notice that some are using them to their advantage. magpopost sila ng picture ng rescue nila na mukhang nakakakaawa tas magcacaption na ""mag-donate na kayo, ubos na yung cat food ko - rescue."" pwede rin yung picture kung saan kita halos lahat na rescues na pinapakain tas ang caption ""ito na ang huling araw na may pagkain sila, baka pwede kayo magdonate para makabili at makakain sila bukas."" or simply, ""wala nang pagkain ang mga rescues namin, pwede kayo magdonate ng ₱200 para sa isang can ng cat food or pwede niyo rin ipadala sa aming bahay (insert address)."" para bagang responsibilidad ng kanilang followers or donators na buhayin yung mga rescues nila. i get it, mahal magpakain at bumuhay ng mga rescues, pero sana magrescue lang sila hangga't sa makakaya ng kanilang bulsa. paano na laamang kung bumaba ang engagements at donations nila to the point na hindi na sustainable yung pagpapatakbo ng shelter? hindi rin imposible na magsara yung shelter at yung mga rescues nila ay mapunta lang sa city pound to be killed. buti man lang kung maraming nagaadopt eh kakaunti na nga lang tas dadagdagan pa nila yung mga rescues para makapaglimos na naman sila ulit sa mga followers nila. hindi ba animal cruelty rin yung paggamit sa kanila para magkaroon ng awa 'effect' sa mga followers nila and minsan 'lowkey' guilt-tripping para magdonate sa mga rescues nila? i'm not saying na bawal na mag-solicit ng donations yung mga shelters kaso yung iba hindi na rin sumasapat yung donations bukod doon sa nilalabas na pera ng mga rescuers. yung ibang shelters nga personal account nila ang ginagamit para sa mga donations kaya mahirap din magkaroon ng transparency and accountability kasi sa bank secrecy laws ng ating bansa, in contrast, sa mga ngo (e.g. paws) or foundations na may sariling bank account nila. hindi ko naman sinasabi na lahat sila ay ill-intentioned but i think every donator intends to know if their donations are really going to the rescues and hindi sila naneneglect because it's going to rescuers instead. what's your take on this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/yo4exw/animal_shelters_and_online_limos/,6 11 2022

My partner's relative was threatened with a lawsuit by the town mayor after posting something negative about the local government,"excuse the username. ginawa ko tong account para magtanong tungkol sa social amelioration program, pero mas urgent to na bagay. for context, may isang confirmed na covid-19 case sa hometown ng partner ko. inannounce ng lgu sa facebook page nila. nagcomment itong relative, sa abot ng kaniyang kaalaman, na hindi pa naman talaga confirmed ang case, dahil pumunta daw mismo ang barangay captain nila at ang pamilya ng pasyente sa munisipyo at walang sinabi sa kanila. nakiusap din siyang iconfirm muna ng mabuti ng lgu ang mga ganoong bagay para makaiwas sa unnecessary panic. pagkatapos nito ay nagpost ang mayor nila ng video sa parehong fb page at cinall out itong relative, tinawag siyang sinungaling at nag-threaten ng legal action kung hindi siya magpupublic apology sa loob ng 48 hours. alam naming may mali din itong relative dahil nagpost siya bago maverify ng lubos ang sinabi niya. pero sobra-sobra naman atang na put on blast siya. pinost po ang ubong pangalan at mukha niya. di rin sumasagot ang lgu pag tinatanong kung ano yung mismong kaso ng isasampa sa kanila kung sakali. may nagsasabing cyberlibel, pero sa pagkakaalam namin (wala sa aming abogado kaya correct us if we're wrong), kailangan ng malicious intent kapag public official or figure ang apektado. may iba pang tinira ang mayor sa video tungkol sa ibang bagay, pero again, walang malicious intent. mali lang pagkakaunawa ng mga tao dahil di naman naicocommunicate ng maayos ang mga directiba nila. ngayon ay natatakot na ang mga taong magsalita ng kahit anong masama sa kanila, kahit na ang daming anomalya na napapansin sa mga guidelines nila, lalo na sa cash aid program, dahil ayaw din nilang mapahiya at makasuhan. gusto lang namin malaman kung ang ganitong gawain ay pwedeng ireklamo, at kung pwede, ay ano ang pinakamabuting paraan. nakapublic sa fb yung video pero ayaw ko muna ilink dito para rin sa privacy ng mga nabanggit, pero kung kailangan, i can send the link to the mods in private. thanks in advance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/fwed5c/my_partners_relative_was_threatened_with_a/,7 04 2020

The burden of taking care of strays,"idk siguro maglalabas lang ako ng sama ng loob. so my mom and my brother has this habit of pagpulot ng stray cats sa kalye and sheltering them. to the point na minsan napupuno na ng strays tong compound namin dahil nagdadala din kasi ng ibang cats yung nga napulot nila. what’s worse is ako yung laging nag aalaga sa kanila kasi lagi silang wala, they’re only home in the morning and late night kahit weekends. so ang nangyayari is yung lahat ng responsibilities ng pag aalaga falls on my back since i’m home most of the time (wfh), to the point na kahit may lagnat na ako, mas chinecheck pa nila kung napakain ko na yung nga strays instead of checking how i’m doing. they are the ones who buy them food yes, but i want to say na di lang enough yung pagbili ng makakain ng mga hayop para maalagaan sila. they’ve become invasive of our home, ang dami pa nilang fur na kinakalat and minsan di ko sila macontrol totally sa nga gusto nilang gawin. i’ve also came to realize na hindi lahat ng strays eh maamo, nakagat na ako once ng isang napulot nila and i had to get anti rabies and anti tetanus shots for them. i don’t want to let them go kasi alam kong they’ll have it worse if they go back to the streets and pag dinala ko sila sa mga shelters, they would recommend adopting them instead of taking them out of our hands. i’m just very upset with my situation at this point. any advice will be appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/17lz1lq/the_burden_of_taking_care_of_strays/,2 11 2023

Story time: Uninformed News Edition,"a friend showed me a tiktok video of a supposed influencer sharing his thoughts on covid. the video (with embedded texts) went like this: ""storytime: covid 19 edition and then dinala sa hospital, dead on arrival. then sabi nung doctor sa mga kamag anak. kung papayag yung family na ang ilagay sa death cert nung namatay ay covid instead of heart attack 😱😱. so yun lang, idk what to do with that information kaya skl."" let me answer you, what you should do with that information is ask someone who is knowledgeable on the topic or at least someone who knows more than you do, cause you definitely don't know a lot. what you should not do though is post a video putting the hospital and medical professionals in a malicious light. for those of you who wants to be educated on the topic: anyone who is symptomatic, we can't mix with those who do not have the symptoms. ubo, sipon, lagnat, hirap sa paghinga, pananakit ng kasukasuan, pagsusuka, pagtatae or pagkawala ng pang-amoy at panlasa. you might be wondering, eh ang daming sakit with the same symptoms. yes, kaya nga po puno ang emergency rooms and covid floors. unless proven na negative ka sa covid (with rt-pcr), it is prudent that we don't place you with those without the symptoms. hospital protocols also dictates that anyone who arrives dead will be tagged as covid suspect (relating to the tiktok vid, paano nasabing heart attack? may ckmb ka? may trop i ka? may ecg ka ba???). covid also complicates underlying conditions like heart, brain problems which might have led to the demise of the patient. did the patient die of a heart problem? possible. did the patient die of covid? possible. hindi sya exclusive, and unless we do post-mortem swab, we will not know. the government ideally should fund more research centers and laboratories, to make testing more available kahit sa maralita. sayang yung mga inutang. hindi lahat ng tao afford ang 2-5k na rt-pcr swab na may 7 days validity lang. pag may rt-pcr ka na timely ang collection, you need not be tagged as suspect and can be treated sa covid negative area, therefore decongesting the covid suspect area, therefore freeing some resources that can be used for those in critical conditions. i am all for freedom of expression, but i also believe in responsible posting. supposed ~influencers~ should help us eradicate misinformation, use their platform for greater good. you also address your audience well. isang taon na tayong lockdown, ang dami nang dinagdag na letra sa cq. baka naman po? if you have any questions, if in any way i can explain things in simpler terms. i also urge people in the medical field to answer people the simplest way possible, to be ""patola"" na. our job extends way outside the corners of the hospital. di na lang covid ang kalaban, bad governance, ignorance and misinformation too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/mgihgq/story_time_uninformed_news_edition/,30 03 2021

Halloween Inequality,"like most other subdivisions in metro manila, ours is an island of middle class comfort and tranquility amidst a sea of poverty. it's your typical village in the south na mas madami ang kotse kesa sa tao, at tuwing naglalakad ako sa labas, puro mga maid, driver at sekyu lang ang nakikita ko, with the exception of the usual senior citizen power-walking group. mas madami din ang matatanda (retired) vs mga households na may pamilya at mga anak. the halloween party was situated in the village clubhouse, which is within the grounds of the subdivision park. the park and the subdivision is separated from the village's main avenue by a chain-link fence, so you can see what's going on from the outside. sa loob, may clown, may magician, may catering, may mga pa-cocktail sa mga parents at matatanda. and on the outside, beyond the wire, may mga bata mula sa mga neighboring depressed areas na naghihintay at nakikinuod lang sa mga tao sa loob. this is where it got a little bit depressing. &#x200b; nung time na para mag ikot ikot sa mga bahay, we all filed into one line palabas ng clubhouse and binuksan yung mga gate para makaikot na kami sa bahay bahay - we were a lot, siguro mga 100 plus, pero mas madami ang mga matatanda like yayas and parents kesa sa mga bata. when we turned around the corner, dun namin nakita na ang daming mga bata kasama ng mga magulang nila na kanina pa daw nag iintay para makakahingi ng candy. sila yung mga galing depressed areas. the event started at 5 pm, and andun pa daw sila mga 3 pm palang. meron pa akong mga side comments na naririnig from fellow neighbors na wag daw papasukin yung mga badjao at mga free-loader. sabi nung isang guard dun sa pamilya na gusto pumasok sa village ""jan lang muna kayo. pwede na kayo bumisita sa bahay pagka may natira"" when we got back home after the dinner and the show, my stepsons got 3 full baskets of candies, chocolates and biscuits. tapos hindi magkasya so kelangan ko pa tumakbo sa bahay para kumuha ng ecobag. looking back, hindi din naman nila kayang ubusin lahat yan, and hindi ko din naman ipapaubos sa kanila yan because it's unhealthy. i'm not one to meddle with the rules and regulations, after all, it's a private event, pero ang awkward lang na habang naglalakad kami, naririnig namin , and ng mga kids ng homeowners yung mga galing sa laylayan na nakikihingi maski isang piraso lang. pakiramdam ko hindi lang ako ang nakaramdam ng awkwardness, but like myself, the others chose to remain silent and just enjoyed the entire thing. our household prepared 98 lootbags filled with tootsie rolls, timtams, kitkats, nerds, warheads and others. meron pa kaming 25 na natira, so which means the event was only roughly at 75% attendance. balak ko sana pumunta dun sa depressed area na malapit samin and ipamigay nalang on oct 31. &#x200b; if i were on the other side of the fence, i'd rather not know what they're doing rather than seeing everything, and yet, hanggang tingin lang ako. perhaps, in the future, mas okay na siguro kung gawin nalang nilang concreto yung bakod kesa wire. &#x200b;",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/17isokv/halloween_inequality/,29 10 2023
Asking for go to restroom,ask lang sa nakakaalam especially sa mga teacher may guidelines po ba kayo from deped regarding if nag paalam yung student niyo na gagamit ng restroom? yung kapatid kasi ng partner ko tumawag sa kadahilanan na hindi siya pinayagan mag cr kasi yun daw yung rules and regulations ng school once na nag umpisa na yung class bawal na daw umihi eh tatlong beses na daw siya nag paalam kasi nga ihing-ihi na siya pero hindi pa din siya pinapayagan kaya ang ginawa niya is umuwi na lang since masama yung pakiramdam niya and may uti din siya. mas lalo daw kasi sumama ng pakiramdam niya yung pinigilan niya ihi niya concern ko lang: health kasi ang nakasalalay sa mga student and affected din ang emotion ng tao kapag may nararamdaman tayo so hindi din makakafocus sa lesson plan ni teacher. and magkakasakit ang student if ganun nga gagawin nila.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/161cl72/asking_for_go_to_restroom/,25 08 2023

We need to volunteer.,"it’s been two weeks since i joined the house to house talakayan for leni. we are targeting the class d and e sectors. honestly, never pa naman kami naka encounter ng hostile and angry mobs. polite naman sila pag nagdedecline, sasabihin nila busy sila, or may pupuntahan, etc. pero just like what tricia robredo said, ibang iba ang situation sa ground, lalo na sa mga class d and e communities. like sa isang bahay na may tarp ni leni, anim o pitong bahay ang kay baby m. don’t get me wrong, sobrang lakas ng sorties ni leni. pero the problem is, it’s becoming an echo chamber. mangilan ngilan lang ang nacoconvert ng sorties. we can’t also discount the fact na mostly class a to c ang nasa sorties. leni’s demographic weakness are class d and e people, which kung mag vovolunteer ka, makikita mo na that’s the reality right now. may nakausap kami na supporter kung bakit di siya pumunta sa pasig, sabi niya, “eh mukhang pang mayaman kasi yung lugar.” mararamdaman mo na they feel intimidated by other kakampinks. based lang naman yan sa experience namin sa house to house. also, napaka konti naming volunteers. parang sa sabado, 10 lang ata ang nag sign up. to think na nasa las piñas kami. sana kung pupunta tayo sa sorties, mag invite tayo ng isang tao mula sa class d and e, lalo na yung mga undecided. samahan natin silang makinig para di sila mailang. the problem kasi with other kakampinks, na di ko naman nilalahat, is they tend to feign moral, socio-economic, and intellectual superiority over others, kaya tuloy di tayo makahatak. alao, let’s do more solidarity walk rather than caravans. mostly naman siguro sa atin dito ay may sasakyn, pero yung ibang wala hindi makasama pag caravans. and please, talk to your local volunteers. they need help. kung nahihiya ka makipag usap, samahan mo lang sila. mainit, papawisan ka, mapapagod, pero sobrang worth it. so fellow redittors, 700k na ata tayo dito, please volunteer. huwag na tayo mag antay mg next sortie bago ipakita ang ating suporta. ps. i posted din sa fb ko and twitter, pero syempre, fb is a babym socmed, and twitter, well, they’re noisy, but they always side with convenience. pps. educate without insult. ppps. may solidarity walk po kami sa saturday dito sa las piñas. 6 am nga lang. pppps. yung mga volunteer groups from different areas, comment niyo dito, and contact person. edit: saturday po pala ang solidarity walk. pasensya po sa wrong info.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/tl37ja/we_need_to_volunteer/,23 03 2022

hanggang ngayon ay wala pa rin kaming ideya kung bakit. magmula sa pagsigaw ni cecil ng, “anong nangyari?! anak, anong nangyari?!” sa tulalang alex na nakatitig sa dilat na mga mata ni joe, hanggang sa pagpunta namin dito sa aking opisina sa barangay, ay wala pa rin kaming makuhang rason mula sa bakit. sa isang maliit na kwarto sa aking opisina’y pinaupo ko muna si alex. tulala at sinusubukang burahin ang dugo sa kanyang mukha gamit ang duguan ring damit n’ya. hinainan ko ng isang bote ng softdrinks at tatlong pandesal mula pa sa agahan namin kanina si alex, na agad namang n’yang kinain ng walang pag-aalinlangan. dito na nagsimulang gumapang ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod. isang kilabot na hindi ko maipaliwanag, habang pinapanood ko si alex na walang awat sa pagkain, habang ako’y hindi ko pa rin magawang matakam sa masarap na lutong nag-aabang sa’kin sa bahay. “alex,” marahan kong sinabi. “ba’t mo ginawa ‘yun?” tumingin lamang sa’kin si alex, patay na mga mata, bibig na mabagal ang nguya. at sa kanyang paglunok ay walang mga salitang bumalik sa’kin. hindi ko alam kung bakit pero bigla kong naalala si jefferson, isang tricycle driver dito sa’min. dalawang taon na ang nakakalipas nang mapatay n’ya ang isang dayo na nakaaway n’ya sa kalsada. nangyari ‘to nang kamuntikan n’yang makasalpukan ang sasakyan ng dayo, at nang nahinto silang dalawa’y nagkasagutan muna sila bago mapikon si jefferson. hinampas n’ya ng bakal na tubo ang dayo. hindi na raw n’ya napigilan dahil sa mga mapanglait na mga salitang tinawag sa kanya. bobo, unggoy, uling, mababa. labing-isang beses paulit-ulit na hinampas ni jefferson sa ulo ang dayo, at sa sobrang lakas ng bawat hampas ay may parte na ng utak na lumabas dito. sa prisinto’y naalala ko si jefferson, iyak nang iyak at humihingi ng tawad dahil sa nangyari. hindi makakain, hindi rin makatulog. nilamon na s’ya ng konsensya n’ya, at ang konsensya n’ya ang tumulak sa kanya na agawin ang baril ng isa sa mga pulis na nagbabantay, at iputok sa kanyang sariling ulo. nasaktan si jefferson, nagalit, at di nakapagpigil. naintindihan ko ang kwento ‘nun. pero bakit hindi ko maintindihan ‘to? alam kong magkasundo ang magkapatid na ‘to. alam ko kung ga’no sila kalapit sa isa’t-isa. kaya pa’no nangyari ‘to? ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod ay gumagapang paakyat hanggang sa aking dibdib, tila ba kumakapit ng mahigpit. pasikip nang pasikip at medyo nahihirapan akong huminga. ang kakaibang pakiramdam na ‘to’y tumitindi habang nanatiling tahimik at nakatitig lamang sa’kin si alex. biglang iniabot ni alex ang kanyang kamay at dito tumalon na ang puso ko. napaatras ako sa aking kinauupuan, at mabilisan kong hinugot ang aking rosaryo mula sa pagkakatago nito sa aking damit. itinutok ko ito kay alex, na walang ibang kibo kun’di ang kunin ang bote ng softdrinks na nasa harapan n’ya. mas bumilis pa ang pagkatok sa aking dibdib, na para bang kamuntikan na kong mamatay. habang si alex nama’y pinapanood lang ako habang patuloy ang kanyang pag-inom. wala nga ata talagang mangyayari, at nang maramdaman ko kung gaano katahimik ang kwarto’y kumalma na ako. bakit sa dulo ng utak ko’y hinihiling ko na may sapi o di kaya’y isang demonyo talaga ang kaharap ko, at sa presensya ng aking rosaryo’y masasaktan s’ya. kahit anong kakaiba. kahit ano basta magkaroon lang ng eksplenasyon ang nangyari. pero siguro’y kakaiba na rin ang ikinikilos ng bata. at siguro nga’y mas dapat talaga akong matakot sa buhay kaysa sa patay. **cecil** “saan ba ko nagkulang?” tanong ni aling cecil sa mga kumare n’yang nakapalibot sa kanya sa masikip na opisina ni chairmain. napapaligiran din s’ya ng makukulay na mga pamaypay na hindi sabay-sabay ang pagaspas sa harap n’ya; nilulunod si aling cecil sa hangin. ang kanyang mukha nama’y tila ba isang rebulto ng santo kung punas-punasan ng mga panyo. “hindi ko pa rin maintindihan,” dugtong n’ya. “hindi naman ako nagkulang sa aruga. pareho ko namang pinapakita sa kanila na pantay ang pagmamahal ko sa kanila.” tuyo na ang mga mata ni aling cecil, ngunit tila ba hindi pa rin tapos ang kanyang pag-iyak. “hindi sila nag-aaway. hindi ko man lang narinig na nagtalo silang dalawa. o kung may pagtatalo man, malamang sa malamang maliit na bagay lang ‘yun. hindi yung ikakamatay mo!” isang labi ng lumapit sa tenga ni aling cecil, “alam mo tingin ko, baka inggit ‘yan. kasi si joe lang may trabaho sa kanilang dalawa, di ba? tapos si alex, wala pa rin sa kolehiyo. nag-aaral pa rin. sigurado akong ‘yun ang dahilan.” isa pang labi ang lumapit sa kabilang tenga naman ni aling cecil, “baka napikon na. kasi di ba halos s’ya na sa lahat ng gawaing bahay? baka pakiramdam n’ya porke’t mas malaki ambag ng kapatid n’ya , alila na s’ya neto.” isang labi naman na kaharap ni aling cecil ang nagsabing, “baka nagbabait-baitan lang kasi nga si joe ang halos sumasalo sa mga bayarin, pati sa pag-aaral n’ya. pero galit talaga s’ya, kasi baka naman may pagkakataong mas nabibigyang-atensyon si joe kahit hindi n’yo napapansin. kasi halimbawa uuwi s’yang pagod galing sa trabaho, syempre di n’yo maiwasang alagaan, pagsilbihan.” sa gitna ng mga labing ito’y si aling cecil, at ang ideyang unti-unting nabubuo dahil sa mga sinasabi ng mga labi sa kanya. “siguro,” sabi n’ya. “siguro nga.” **abbie** ang pangalan n’ya’y abbie. social worker daw s’ya. pagpasok n’ya’y agad bumungad sa’kin ang asul na bra sa ilalim ng dilaw na blouse nang tapatan ito ng liwanag mula sa bintanang katabi ko. sa kanyang pagtali ng buhok ay nakita kong basang-basa na ang kanyang kili-kili at kumikinang na sa pawis ang kanyang leeg. “alex?” sabi n’ya habang maya’t-mayang tinutulak ng kanyang daliri ang salamin n’yang dumudulas sa kanyang matangos na ilong. “bakit di mo ikwento muna sa’kin ang nangyari bago tayo umalis dito?” pasensya ka na, abbie. hindi ko nagawang sabihin kay chairman, na kilala pa mandin namin. hinding-hindi ko rin masasabi sa’yo. walang ibang maglalahad ng nangyari kun’di ang mga taong nais magbigay kahulugan dito, kasi kung ako tatanungin kung bakit, sa totoo lang, hindi ko rin alam ang isasagot. may nabasag akong bote sa kusina kanina, at sa pagpulot ko nito’y pumasok sa isip ko ang isang udyok. yung tipo ng udyok kapag nasa mataas kang lugar, at bigla mo na lang gustong itulak ang kasama mo. pero alam mong hindi ito dapat gawin, at kakapit ka pa nang mas mahigpit sa kanila para masiguro mong hindi ito mangyayari. ang udyok na ito’y nagsabi sa’kin na isaksak ko kay kuya ang basag na bote. at nalaman ko na lang na totoo na pala ang lahat nang dumapo sa aking balat ang mainit na dugo ni kuya. nahinto lang ako nang maramdaman ko ang buto sa leeg n’ya at nang marinig kong nabibilaukan na s’ya sa kanyang sariling dugo. hindi ko pa rin alam kung bakit. sana, tulad ng iniisip ni chairman, ay nasapian na nga lang ako. pero nakita ko ang lahat, andun ako. hindi ko lang alam na totoo pala ang lahat. namatay si kuya joe sa wala. at hindi ko matanggap na wala. normal lang sana ang sabado namin. tahimik. nanonood lang si kuya ng tv, naglilinis ako sa kusina. si nanay nama’y namamalengke ng pananghalian namin. bicol express daw ang lulutuin n’ya. puta, sinira ko ang araw. gusto kong umiyak dahil hindi na kami babalik sa salo-salo namin. “alex?” muling tawag ni abbie. “gusto kong malaman kung bakit. tayong dalawa lang. kaibigan mo ko dito. hinding-hindi ko ‘to sasabihin sa nanay mo, sa mga kapitbahay n’yo. may mga naririnig ako sa labas na dahil daw sa inggit? totoo ba ‘to? sa inggit nga? magmula nang dinala ako ni chairman dito sa maliit na kwartong ito’y napagpasyahan kong manahimik na lang sa nangyari. sa ngayo’y nilalabanan ko ang mga luha, nilalabanan ko ang panginginig ng aking bibig, at ang mga salitang gustong lumabas mula sa’kin. dapat mukhang hindi ko pinagsisisihan. dapat mukha akong galit. para naman mabigyang halaga, mabigyan ng ibig-sabihin ang pagkamatay ni kuya joe. dapat tinatatak ko sa utak ko na dapat lang! dapat lang sa kanya ang nangyari. dapat hindi ako bibigay. dahil kapag natalo ako, mamatay talaga sa wala si kuya. “sige, kung ayaw mong magkwento, ako muna. kasi naalala ko ‘tong isang batang babae at ang tatay n’yang abusado. tatay n’yang lasinggero. tatay n’yang isang beses s’yang hinipuan sa kanyang sariling kwarto at pinilit. ampon ang batang ‘yon, at tatay-tatayan n’ya lang etong umaabuso sa kanya. takot na takot ang bata dahil pakiramdam n’ya isang gabi’y papatayin na lang s’ya bigla neto. kaya naman isang gabi, nang bigla s’yang pinuntahan ng kanyang tatay upang pagsamantalahan ulit, sinasaksak ito ng bata gamit ang lapis sa mata, sa leeg, at sa dibdib.” kumuha ng panyo si abbie. sa kanyang paggalaw ay muling sumisilip ang kanyang bra sa likod ng blouse na parang mga batang naglalaro sa likod ng kurtina. “masarap sa pakiramdam, pero pumapatay pa rin s’ya ng tao. ilan taon n’yang dinibdib ‘yun. hanggang ngayon nararamdaman pa rin n’ya ang mga kamay ng tatay n’ya sa kanyang ari. sa kanyang dibdib. ilang taon bago n’ya matanggap ang ginawa n’ya. ngayon, medyo mahirap pa ring ikwento, pero kahit papaano’y kaya ko na. nangyari na kasi.” para bang may sumuntok sa aking dibdib nang marinig ko ‘to. bigla kong tinanggal ang aking paningin sa kanyang bra, at sa paggalaw ng aking mga mata’y bigla kong naramdaman ang pamumuo ng mga luha. “ayos lang, alex. pero andito lang ako. aalagaan ka muna namin. tapos pag handa ka na, makikinig ako. kahit pakonte-konte pa, ayos lang. aantayin kong mabuo ang kwento mo.” bumibilis bigla ang tibok ng puso ko. lalong nanginginig ang aking labi. at biglang pumasok si kuya sa isip ko, tumatakbo papalayo sa akin. mga bata pa kami, at hinahabol ko s’ya. “alex?” kuya wag kang lumayo! “alex?” kuya dito ka lang! kailangan kita dito! “sige, ayusin na natin pag-alis mo.” at parang isang batang nadapa sa semento, dito na walang awat na tumulo ang luha sa aking mga mata. “alex?” “hindi ko rin alam… hindi… ko rin alam. sorry, kuya! sorry! hindi ko rin alam kung bakit! patayin n’yo na lang ako! hindi ko alam anong nangyari! hindi ko na kaya!” lumalabo na ang aking paningin, pero kahit ga’no kalabo ang aking mga mata’y kitang-kita ko ang gulat at takot sa mukha ni abbie. pasensya ka na, kuya.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/nlygsa/alex_tanghaling_tapat_ng_sabado_2021/,27 05 2021
Tagalized Story.,"may story ako. ako lang ang nag-iisang babae sa pinag-tatrabahuhan kong kumpanya at alam ko na kung bakit. isa akong fresh graduate sa kolehiyo at gusto ko na talagang makapag-simula ng career agad-agad na walang kinalaman sa pagse-serve ng pagkain, pagpupunas ng mga gamit, o pag-dadala o timpla ng kape sa isang matandang negosyante. sa naka-sanayan nag-aapply ako sa trabaho na may anim na araw na trabaho at marami-rami na rin akong interview na napagdaanan. alam ko na ang tinapos kong hrm na kurso ay hindi gaanong makaka-kuha ng magandang oportunidad, pero naniniwala pa rin ako na may mas maganda pang trabaho na naghihintay sa akin. kaya naman nanatili akong positibo, matyaga, at nag-aapply lang sa mga office jobs na may magandang benipisyo. kahit halos wala na akong mapag-kunan ng makakain dahil sa magastos na mga interview, at least mapapag-tibay naman nito ang kakaunting pride na natitira sa akin. halos tatlong linggo na rin ang nakalipas, may isa akong phone interview sa isang internet security company. ang kumpanyang iyon ay maraming offices sa amin at naghahanap sila ng bagong customer support specialist para sa kanilang international department. ang mga requirements ay maganda o mahinahon na boses, good spoken and written grammar, kakaunting tech-knowledge, at may kakayahang mag-trabaho sa umaga at gabi. ang office ay dalawang sakay lang sa mula sa amin, at mayroon silang magandang offer sa health insurance. nag-aapply ako kahit lmitado lang din ang alam ko sa computer science. naging maayos naman ang phone interview at matapos ang dalawang meetings sa hr at sa management, binigyan nila ako ng isang napaka-gandang offer (kahit na wala pa talaga akong experience sa kahit anong trabaho). sa loob ng unang linggo ko, kailangan kong magtrabaho nang regular shift na 9-5 (am) para maging online ako kasabay ng manager ko, na nag-trabaho sa ibang branch ng kumpanya. pagkatapos noon ay kailangan kong magtrabaho para sa regular na schedule ko bilang support - ang schedule ko ay 6 na araw na pasok (09:00 am -05:00 pm (am) at may isang araw na night shift 09:00 pm - 05:00 am respectively). sa unang araw ko, ang suot ko ay isang loose na sweater at mahabang skirt. bilang sa kaalaman ko ay sa ganitong uri ng trabaho ay karamihan mga lalaki ang empleyado, ayaw ko naman mag-cause ng unnecessary attention dahil sa provocatively o inappropriately pag-susuot ng hindi naayon na attire. ang lalaki sa front desk ay mukha namang maayos na tao. pinakilala n'ya ang sarili n'ya bilang si andrew bago n'ya ako tulungang mag-fill out ng mga paperwork at sinamahan n'ya na ako sa aking mesa at sa isang open space na workspace. nakatitig lang ako sa tila walang katapusang mga desks habang naglalakad kami, napansin ko na halos hindi mo makikita ang mga mukha ng bawat taong nagta-trabaho na naka-upo sa bawat desks. wala man lang akong nakita o napansin na babae habang nag-lalakad kami sa tila baga'y walang katapusang workspace na iyon, na talaga namang hindi normal at nakaka-bahala. kahit ang kalmadong presensya ni andrew ay hindi kayang maiwaglit ang wari kakaibang pakiramdam na naka-tuon sa akin. halos maubusan ako ng hininga ng maramdaman ko ang mga presensya ng bagong kong co-workers na tila nagsasabi na ""hindi ka nababagay dito"". nagulat ako ng biglang huminto si andrew sa isang desk na napuno ng mga printed memes, floral stickers, at isang lumang keychain na naka-patong sa harap ng monitor. bukod pa doon ay natatakpan na rin ng makapal na alikabok ang keyboard, monitor at ang natitirang ispasyo ng desk. ""ahhh... anong nangyari..."" sabi ni andrew sa medyo upset na boses. ""pasensya ka na."" sabi nito habang nakatingin sa aking mga papeles. ""ah... aya. dapat matagal na 'tong nalinis. kailangan kong maka-usap ang custodian"". ""ok lang 'yun"", sagot ko. ""puwede ko namang punasan na lang 'yan, wala namang problema"". medyo asiwa na noon si andrew, pero habang ginagala ko ang aking paningin ay malinaw na wala ng ibang bakanteng desk maliban doon. mabilis na natapos ang araw na iyon. natutunan ko na ang mga dapat kung gawin na sumagot sa support related phone calls at gumawa ng bagong ticket para sa system. kailangan ko ring i-monitor ang lahat ng pumapasok na chats at written tickets at isaayos ito base sa level ng urgency at type nito. hindi naman ako required mag-bigay ng technical advice, pero dapat maging pamilyar ako sa aming product software. bilang wala pa namang mga tawag ay pinaki-alaman ko muna ang manual. halos wala akong maintindihan sa mga naroon kaya naman ginogle ko na lang ang karamihan na nasa manual. kinumusta ako noon ng manager ko at mukhang hindi s'ya masaya sa mga lapses ko sa mga materials. dahil pakiramdam ko wala akong matinong nagawa at gagawin sa mga oras na iyon ay panandalian akong nag-break para linisin ang mesa ko. tumayo ako para tanungin si andrew kung saan makaka-kuha ng basahan para sa mesa ko. agad-agad kong pinagsisihan ang desisyon kong iyon. ang bawat mata sa kwarto ay tila napako sa pagtayo ko sa aking kinauupuan. hindi ako sigurado pero maraming mga bulungan akong narinig habang papalayo ako sa aking mesa. ang kaninang maingay na mga keyboard ay pahina nang pahina na halos kainin na ako ng lupa sa sobrang hindi ko pagiging kumportable at self-conscious na rin at the same time. napansin ko na lang na halos halikan ko na ang dibdib ko sa pagyuko para lang hindi ako mapansin. bago ako maka-rating sa isang palikong daan patungo sa front desk ay buong-lakas kong tinignan ang isang tila walang hiyang lalaki na nakatitig sa akin. hindi ko alam kung ano ang inaasahan ko, pero 'yung overall appearance ng lalaking naka-hooding pang-asar na 'yun ay nagbigay ng matinding kilabot sa buong katawan ko. siguro mga ka-edad ko s'ya pero hindi man lang s'ya nahiya o natinag sa pagkaka-titig n'ya sa akin sa kabila ng pagtitig ko sa kanya na may halong pagka-bwisit at inis. isang kakila-kilabot na ngiti ang sumilaw sa mga labi nito habang naka-titig sa parteng bukong-bukong ng aking mga paa at dahan-dahan itong bumalik sa kanyang monitor. inisip ko kung anong magiging reaksyon n'ya kapag tinitigan ko rin ng kaparehong paraan ng pagtitig n'ya sa akin ang tinitigyawat n'yang leeg. parehong reaksyon pa rin ang nakuha ko habang naglalakad ako pabalik sa aking mesa kasama ang box ng computer wipes sa mga kamay ko. may maganda ring nangyari sa araw na iyon. habang nililinis ko ang mga drawer ng mesa ko ay may nakita akong half-used notebook mula sa nakaraang nagta-trabaho sa mesa ko. hindi n'ya nilagay ang first name n'ya, kundi initial lang at last name: j. espiritu. pero, base sa dekorasyon ng notebook, sigurado ako na babae rin s'ya kagaya ko. ang mga naiwan n'yang gamit ay nagbigay ng kapanatagan sa akin, pero 'yung notebook ang talagang pumukaw ng atensyon ko. doon ay sinabi nito ang pina-ikli at simpleng manual gamit ang easy-to-undertand terms at mga explenasyon sa nakaka-litong terminolohiya at komplikadong panuto sa manual. sa tulong n'ya ay nasurpresa ko ang aking manager sa aking product knowledge pagkatapos ng shift ko. matapos ang isang magandang araw ay buong tapang akong gumala sa office at nag-explore sa pantry. binenta ni andrew sa akin ang top-notch coffee machine at snacks sa nasabing pantry, tutal nagugutom na rin naman ako matapos ang isang emotionally, intellectually and productive na araw na 'yun. (ansabe). tsaka, medyo butas na rin 'yung bulsa at namumula na ang mga credit cards ko, kaya naman ayos na ako sa ilang pirasong masasarap na cookies. habang papalapit ako ay may narinig akong malakas na usapan at tawanan sa pantry. sa katangahan ko ay inisip ko na baka naman mas mainit, friendly o kahit maka-tao na sila sa akin. subalit ang maliit na pantry ay napuno ng katahimikan the moment na pumasok ako sa pantry. may limang lalaki doon na mag-kakaiba ang edad at lalaki na naka-upo sa palibot ng isang maliit na lamesa, at lahat sila ay naka-titig na direkta sa akin. ""panget na araw?"" - tugon ng isang pang-asar na boses. agad kong itinaas ang ulo ko mula sa pagkaka-titig sa sahig para hanapin ang pinag-mulan ng boses. hindi naging mahirap sa aking hanapin at malaman na mula iyon sa naka-hoodie na walang-hiyang tumitig sa akin nung nakaraan lang. ""siguro marami ka ng experience?"" - sambit pa nito sa nakaka-asar na tono at may-unting pag-taas ng kilay. ""para makakuha ng komportableng trabaho. siguro sikat ka?"". ""ano 'to, high-school?"" - sagot ko sa malakas na boses. hindi ko hilig kumompronta ng tao, pero sobra na 'to. hostility is one thing, social awkwardness is another, pero pakiramdam ko isa 'tong 80's na high-school drama na mga trenta anyos ang mga bida bilang mga teenagers. ""nandito lang ako para kumuha kape at kung may problema ka sa trabaho ko, puwede mong dalhin sa hr kung ano man ang issue mo"". nagpatuloy ako habang ine-enjoy ang namumutla at pahiyang mukha ng mga taong 'yun. mabuti naman, gusto kong maramdaman nila ang katiting na discomfort na buong araw kung kinakaharap. pinili kong lumayo sa aking mga co-workers, naglakad ako ng taas noo pabalik sa mesa ko na may hawak-hawak na tasa ng kape. bago pa ako maka-upo at enjoyin ang masarap na kape, napansin kong may isang mensahe galing sa hindi kilalang number: ""you have quite an attitude, don't you?"" nanigas ako habang hawak ang cell phone sa isa kong kamay at kape sa kabila. habang prino-proseso ko ang tila breach sa personal security ko, naka-tanggap ulit ako ng dalawa pang mensahe. isa ay ang hubo't-hubad kong katawan na sinend ko sa una kong serious college boyfriend. ang pangalawa: ""bakit hindi mo ngayon ibigay 'yang picture sa hr?"" sa totoo lang, sobrang naapektuhan ako sa invasion ng privacy ko. pumasok ang kahihiyan sa akin at sobrang naiinis ako for drawing so much unwanted attention sa sarili ko. kasalanan ko lahat 'to. pumasok ako sa isang office na puno ng ethical hackers na may pare-parehong pangalan ng aso bilang password. walang duda na ang litratong iyon ay umiikot na sa buong office at lahat ng iyon ay salamat sa walang hiyang ka-trabaho ko, at isa na akong kakatuwang tao sa loob ng office. hindi ko na ginalaw ang kape ko at umuwi na lang, habang pinipigilan ko ang bawat emosyon na bumuhos hanggang makarating ako sa safety ng bahay. halos hindi ako matigil sa kaiiyak nung gabing 'yun, iniisip ko na ang mga mukha ng mga ka-trabaho ko habang tigang na tigang na nakatitig sa hubad kong katawan. mga alas tres na ng madaling araw, doon ko lang na-realize na wala ng kwenta para pa magpaka-lunod ako sa kahihiyan. kailangan kong gumawa ng plano para maka-survive sa ganitong uri ng workplace. quitting is not an option kasi masyadong malaki ang pasweldo nila para tumigil ako. tsaka, halos tinapay na lang ang kaya kong bilhin sa araw-araw. ang pangalawa kong option ay pumunta sa hr, but there's no way i was going to open that can of worms. hindi ko mapapatunayan kong sino talaga ang nag-send ng mga mensahe na iyon. last option? stick with it, keep my head down, gawin ang trabaho na pinasukan ko at 'wag pansinin ang iba pang mga harassment na gagawin nila. 'yun nga ang ginawa ko. sa kabuuan ng isang linggong training ko ay pumapasok ako on time, hindi ako umaalis sa desk ko liban na lang kung pupunta sa palikuran. iniwasan ko rin ang kahit anong contact kanino man at pinanatili ko lang ang aking mga mata sa mga inanimate objects. salamat kay j. espiritu, palagi akong on top ng training ko. sa bawat bagong task na galing sa manager ko, laging may katumbas na entry sa kanyang notebook. wala ng nakaka-gagong texts at face-to-face na kumprontasyon, pero mayroong kakatuwang pakiramdam na panibagong sisira sa kalagayan ko. sa darating na biyernes na ang huling training ko, na nagdala sa akin sa huling entry sa notebook. night shift survival guide: - matulog sa buong umaga bago ang shift at 'wag na 'wag kang matutulog. - walang sino man ang dapat maka-pasok. - panatilihing may pepper spray na dala. (sa kahit anong sitwasyon). - i-check ang bawat aisle, meeting rooms. huwag kalimutang i-check ang ilalim ng lamesa, balkonahe, kitchen tables at kahit likod ng cooler. - laging mag-open ng skype na naka-ready sa emergency in case na hindi gumana ang mobile services. - panatilihing updated sa kaibigan/pamilya/lover kada oras. ang nasabing listahan ay medyo may kahulugan. una, sabi ng hr puwede naman akong matulog sa pagitan ng 2-5 am, basta malapit palagi sa akin ang office smartphone. mayroon nga silang pull out couch sa isang conference room para lang talaga sa ganitong sitwasyon. pangalawa, ang buong shift ay phone calls, kaya palaging may paraan para maka-tawag mula sa office phone, tama? lastly, ang mga naka-outlined sa ""guide"" ay parang o.a at paranoid. siguro 'yung listahan ay satirical? (ewan ko). siguro si espiritu parehas kami ng pakiramdam tungkol sa mga tila patay gutom na mga asong cold-blooded na co-workers? pero 'yung isip ko nag-tatrabaho ng sobra-sobra para makita ang logic sa likod ng mga pag-iingat na ito. may kakatuwa akong pakiramdam na may importanteng impormasyon akong hindi nalalaman. lahat 'yun iniisip ko habang paalis ako ng bahay nung biyernes na 'yun, last day ng training ko. ""andrew"", - dahan-dahan akong lumapit sa kanya. ""puwede ba mag-tanong?"" ""sure thing"", - sagot n'ya na may maaliwalas na ngiti sa kanyang mga labi. ""nagtataka lang ako, bakit wala akong nakikitang ibang support agents. i mean, 'di ba dapat merong at least lima pang tao para ma-cover 'yung six-day rotation cycle?"" ""kailangan mong tanungin ang manager mo tungkol d'yan. most likely naka-kalat sila sa iba pang branch sa syudad. normal lang naman 'yun sa ganoong kaso"", - sagot n'ya. pakiramdam ko tapos na kami sa diskusyon na 'yun matapos s'yang bumalik sa final tasks n'ya para sa linggong iyon. ""meron bang ibang agent na nag-trabaho dito liban sa akin?"" - pagpapatuloy ko, dahil ganun na lamang ang kagustuhan kong malaman ang iba pang detalye sa babaeng nag-fill out ng notebook na s'ya namang ginagamit ko sa buong linggong iyon. ""oo, may isang babae na humawak sa posisyon mo ng panandalian"", - ani ni andrew, habang naka-titig pa rin sa screen ng kanyang screen. pero napansin kong tumigil na s'ya sa pag-tatype o pag-galaw ng mouse. wari ko ay naka-titig lang s'ya sa iisang spot sa monitor n'ya. ""andrew"", - nag-salubong ang mga kilay ko. ""sino 'yung nag-trabaho malapit sa main working space na talagang nakaka-inis? maputla, medyo payat, maitim at kulot na buhok?"" - tanong ko, habang nagpapaikot ng daliri sa bandang ulunan ko para i-describe ang pagkaka-kulot ng nasabing lalake. ""ah... si michael"", - sagot nito, napansin nito ang pagiging iritable ng boses ko. ""may problema ba? ginugulo ka ba n'ya?"" ""hindi"" - sagot ko, pero sa isip-isip ko ay nagtatalo na ang emosyon at sarili ko. ""have a good weekend, andrew"" ""ikaw din"", - sagot nito, halata na may pagtataka sa boses nito habang papaalis ako. sa buong weekend na 'yun ay binabalik-balikan ko ang mga nangyari sa akin sa unang linggo ko. pakiramdam ko may hindi sinasabi si andrew sa akin na importante. wala namang rason para maging iretable s'ya nung nabanggit ko 'yung babaeng nag-trabaho bago ako. may nag-reklamo na kaya kay michael dati? pu-puwede kayang si j. espiritu? si michael ba ang dahilan ng survival guide sa notebook? bakit s'ya umalis? napaka-daming teorya ang bumagabag sa buong weekend ko. bago ko pa nalaman, oras na para bumalik sa trabaho. ito ang araw na talagang sobrang daming trabaho. kahapon ay lunes, ang unang regular day shift. mabilis lang dumaan ang nasabing araw, habang aligaga ako sa pag-sagot ng tawag, recording, sorting at assigning ng dose-dosenang customer complaints sa system namin. hindi sapat ang salitang nasanay na ako at pagkatapos ng araw na 'yun ay sobrang pagod at ubos na ako. saktong maglo-logout na ako, naka-tanggap na naman ako ng mensahe mula sa hindi kilalang number. ""ang sipag mo naman. hindi na ako makapag-hintay na mag night shift ka"" seryoso?! ito ang kauna-unahang mensahe na bumalot sa buong pagkatao ko ng takot. agad-agad kong ginala ang paningin ko kung nasa paligid ba si michael para kumprontahin ko s'ya sa pagse-send ng mensahe, pero kanina pa pala s'ya umalis. matapos kong pakalmahin ang sarili ko, umuwi na ako at sinusubukan kong hanapin si j. espiritu online. ang pinaka best bet ko noon ay sa linkedin, at doon nga ay sinusubukan kong galugarin ang buong listahan ng mga babae na may kinalaman sa proficient technologies na naka-lagay sa profile nila (halos kakaunti lang talaga sila). nung wala akong makita ay pumunta ako kay andrew at doon nga sa friend list n'ya ay sa wakas nakita ko na ang hinahanap ko. may babae na pangalan ay jennah espiritu at unemployed ang status. nag-send ako ng friend request na may mensahe na nag-papakilala at tinanong ko s'ya kung hinarass ba s'ya ng isa n'yang ka-trabaho. sa wakas, pakiramdam ko may patutunguhan na ako, natulog ako at inihanda ang sarili para sa bukas na event. naisip ko na baka may kakaibang mangyayari dahil sa pagbabago ng schedule nung natulog ako ng miyerkules. nag-check ako ng linkedin halos pagka-gising ko mga ala una. walang kahit anong sign kay jennah, kaya naman natulog ulit ako para makapag-handa sa night shift. medyo kinakabahan ako at excited at the same time kasi puwede ko ng mas malibot ang buong place of work ko intimately. dahil walang day crowd, malaya akong makaka-gala at ma-eenjoy ang cookies, dumura sa baso ni michael, kahit ano! may mga iilan pa ring mga nag-tatrabaho nung dumating ako para sa shift ko, pero hindi ko naman iyon pinansin at dahil sa nag-uumapaw na mga tawag at chats na aasikasuhin. makalipas ang dalawang oras, ang bugso ng mga tawag at chats pati mga tickets ay unti-unting bumagal hanggang tuluyan na nga itong tumigil ng sabay-sabay halos alas onse na ng gabi noon. sumandal ako sa kinauupuan ko at ginala-gala ang mga paningin sa aking workspace. wala ng tao noon sa office at least sa nakikita ko. naka-bukas ang lahat ng ilaw pero nung tinanggal ko ang headphones ko, may narinig akong mahinang jingling melody sa hindi kalayuan. para s'yang christmas carol, pero hirap akong tukuyin kong saan ito nangga-galing. wala namang dahilan para matakot ako sa pangyayari, pero pakiramdam ko ang mga nagtayuang balahibo sa mga kamay ko ay nagsilbing alarm. nang tumayo ako sa aking kinauupuan, nawala 'yung melody. well, naging paranoid na ako dati. minsan ko ng inisip na na may lalaking sumusunod sa akin isang gabi hanggang nilagpasan n'ya ako at nagtungo sa kalapit na tindahan sa 'di kalayuan. kahit mag-isa lang ako, lagi kong dino-double at triple check ang mga lock ng bahay bago matulog. aaminin ko na ang mga takot ko ay wala naman talagang basehan. mayroong naka-iwan ng headphones na konektado pa rin sa computer nito at naka-on ang music. o siguro may office party sa ibang kumpanya sa baba ng building. ang makarinig ng kanta ay nakaka-takot lamang sa mga kakatuwang horror movies, 'di ba? 'di ba?! para maka-siguro, hinalughog ko ang office para maka-siguro na mag-isa na nga lang ako. habang naglalakad sa gitna ng mga magkaka-dikit na desks, naisip ko kung gaano ako ka-swerte na mayroon akong sariling corner spot. hindi ko siguro kakayanin na mapalapit sa kahit sinong mga hindi kaaya-aya kong mga co-workers. matapos ko ma-check ang bawat rows ay dumiretcho ako sa front desk area at nagmamasid sa mga kagamitan ni andrew sa paghahanap ng clues. nung wala akong makitang clues ay bumalik ako sa main room ng pantry. unti-unti ng mas nagiging relaxed ang mga senses ko at tsaka ko lang napag-tanto na napasarap ata ang taste-testing ko sa mga cookies sa halip na mag-hanap ng mga kahina-hinalang mga bagay. kailangan ko ng tumigil sa kaka-kain ng cookies, pero dahil bumalik na naman ang kaninang tunog na naririnig ko, mas malakas s'ya ngayon. at the same time, ang work smartphone ko (na kinakailangan dala-dala namin kung aalis kami sa aming work station) tumunog at may mensahe mula sa hindi na namang kilalang number. so, nag-eenjoy ka ba sa cookies, ha? nanigas ang buong katawan ko habang prino-proseso ng utak ko ang mga pangyayari. siguro hindi talaga umalis ng office si michael at ngayon tinatakot ako. kinalikot ko ang tenga ko noon at nakinig ng maigi. walang kahit sino sa pantry as least sa nakikita at naririnig ko. tsaka, kung si michael ay nasa main workspace, hindi naman ganun kahirap na hulaan o sabihin na kumakain ako ng cookies. habang dahan-dahan akong humihinga, hindi ko muna pinansin ang tunog at nakinig ako ng maigi kung may iba pa akong tunog na maririnig. wala. dahan-dahan, naglakad ako sa may pantry drawers at doon may nakita akong malaking kutsilyo. alam ko bang gumamit ng kutsilyo? hindi. kaya ko kayang paalisin kung sino man ang unarmed na kalaban? syempre. papunta na sana ako pabalik sa aking work station ng biglang may tawag na pumasok mula sa work phone. ipinosisyon ko ang sarili ko ng kumportable sa pader ng pantry, kutsilyo sa kanang kamay, cell phone sa kabila, bago pa ako maka-sagot with the standard customer support greeting. nag static na sa kabilang linya at iba pang ingay sunod ang tuluyang pagka-putol ng linya at katahimikan. nung tinignan ko ang cell phone, nakita kong naka-patay na ito. sinubukan kong buksan ulit ito, pero hindi na ito gumagana. ok, ngayon kailangan ko ng bumalik sa computer ko in case na may pumasok pang mga tawag. naalala ko bigla ang isa sa mga guide na galing kay jennah habang isinusuksok ko ang walang kwentang cell phone sa bulsa ko. - laging mag-open ng skype na naka-ready sa emergency in case na hindi gumana ang mobile services. nangyari rin kaya 'to sa kanya? ang mga instructions sa notebook ay unti-unti ng nagkaroon ng kahulugan, at minumura ko ang sarili ko dahil sa pagiging tanga. sa oras na lumabas ang mga salita sa bibig ko ay may isa na namang mensahe ang dumating sa cell phone. kinuha ko iyon at sinubukang i-unlock, pero 'yung regular home screen ay hindi lumalabas. ang lumabas lang ay isang white screen na may maikling text. putang ina. ang mga babae dapat hindi ginagamit ng ganung mga uri ng salita. matapos kong mabasa 'yun ay nawala na ito sa screen at may panibagong text ang lumabas. bakit hindi ka lumabas at makipag-laro? huwag mo ng isiping bitbitin pa 'yang kutsilyong hawak mo. wala ring magagawa 'yan sa hawak kong baril. tinapon ko ang cell phone ko sa lapag at agad-agad ay nagtungo ako sa aking computer. ang tunog ay mas lalong lumakas habang papalapit ako sa aking lamesa, doon ay nakita kong may isang baboy na stuffed toy. may fabric button ito sa bandang paanan at music note na kasama. dito nagmumula ang tunog at nagpapatunay lamang na hindi ako mag-isa at may kung sino akong kasama. ang malala pa, pinapanood nila ang bawat galaw ko at sinusubukang takutin gamit ang mga laruang pambata. unti-unti ng dumadaloy ang pagpapanic sa aking buong katawan at naghahanda na sa fight or flight scenario. huminga ako ng malalim, sinusubukan kong pakalmahin ang buong katawan ko. so far wala pa naman akong naririnig ng kahit anong palatandaan na may ibang tao sa loob ng office. may mga background noises galing sa syudad sa labas at ang mga ingay mula sa naka-limutang patayin na computer ng isang employee. kung sino man ang gumagawa nito sa akin, kailangan kong malaman ang kanilang eksaktong lokasyon para maplano ko ng maayos ang pag-takas ko. isa pa, kailangan kong maka-kuha ng tulong sa lalong mas madaling panahon. habang iginigilid ko ang laruan ay umupo na ako sa aking upuan at pinull-up ang skype for business application. mabilis akong nag-dial ng 911, habang naka-loudspeaker ang telepono. tumunog na nga ang dial tone at agad-agad ay may live operator na sa kabilang linya. ibibigay ko na sana ang mga hindi kanais-nais na pangyayari sa akin ng mga oras na iyon ng may biglang humawak sa bukong-bukong ko mula sa ilalim ng lamesa. halos maubos ang buong lakas ko sa pagsigaw habang nagpu-pumiglas ang mga paa at mabilis na tumakbo sa abot ng aking makakaya sa bilis na hindi ko akaling kaya ko. may narinig akong kung anong kumusyon sa aking likuran habang tumakbo, kasunod ng isang malakas ng putok, na inisip ko na lamang na galing sa kung ano o sino man ang humahabol sa akin. bago ko pa malaman ay halos nasa ground floor na ako papunta sa pinto lagpas sa gwardiya na halatang nagulat sa mga nangyayari. ang malamig na hangin ay mabilis na pumasok sa manipis kong sweater habang papalapit ako sa isang malapit na pedestrian para humingi ng tulong. tumawag sila ng 911 at ang mga pulis ay agad namang dumating wala pang sampung minuto. habang naghihintay ako kasama ang gwardiya para sa kanilang pag-dating, hindi maalis sa isip ko ang sinulat ni jennah na warning, at kung gaano ako ka-tanga para ipagsa walang bahala ang mga ito. - i-check ang ang bawat aisle, meeting room. huwag kalimutang i-check ang ilalim ng lamesa, balkonahe, kitchen tables at kahit likod ng cooler. agad-agad namang sinulat ng pulis ang mga nangyari sa akin at iniwan ako kasama ang isang pulis officer, umakyat s'ya para i-check ang office. wala namang naka-labas-masok sa building mula nung tumakbo ako palabas, kaya malaki ang posibilidad na naroroon pa rin ang salarin at nagtatago sa loob. sa pag-iisip ay halos bumaliktad ang buong sikmura ko at mas lalo akong lumapit sa may armas kong kasama. maya-maya pa matapos kaming iwanan ng mga pulis, ang kasama kong pulis ay nag-radyo at isa-isa may mga boses na nagpapa-palit-palit sa radyo na humingi ng backup at nga mga codes na hindi ko maintindihan. mabilis na nag-escalate ang mga sumunod na pangyayari. imbis na pauwi ay dinala nila ako sa police station at doon ay nanatili ako sa isang interrogation room ng halos 2 oras bago pa sa wakas may dalawang pulis officer ang kumausap sa akin. pagod na ako noon, miserable ang kalagayan at higit sa lahat litong-lito sa kung papaano naganap ang mga pangyayari. gusto ko ng umuwi pero nanatili pa ako ng ilang oras para i-kuwento ang mga pangyayari sa dalawang pulis officer. 'ahh... meron kang kutsilyong hawak habang tumakbo ka galing sa pantry papunta sa lamesa mo? sigurado ka ba?' tanong ng isang nakaka-tandang officer na nagpakilala bilang senior investigator manlapig. 'ah. ah... oo.' pautal-utal kong sagot sa kanya. 'naniniwala akong meron. nag-papanic na ako noon, kaya mahirap sabihin. tapos may baboy na stuffed toy, ' sabi ko, habang tila baga'y nawawalan ako ng abilidad na mag-isip ng tama. 'at naniniwala ka na ang taong humaharass sa'yo ay si michael villareal?' sabi ng isa pang officer, hindi ko maalala 'yung pangalan n'ya. wala s'yang badge. 'hindi ko alam buong pangalan n'ya, pero wala na akong ibang kilala na iba pang responsable.' 'at sa huling pagkakataon, just for the record, anong nangyari matapos mong mag-dial ng 911?' tanong ni manlapig sa ika-apat na pagkakataon sa gabing 'yun. 'may kung sino ang humawak sa binti ko. bukong-bukong, actually. nangyari 'yun bago pa ako magkaroon ng pagkakataong ipaliwanag ang sitwasyon sa operator. nagsusumigaw at piglas ang mga paa ko tapos tumakbo hanggang may makita akong tao sa labas na pina-tawag ako sa 911 para sa tulong.' sagot ko, habang pagod na pagod sa paulit-ulit at paikot-ikot na pagtatanong. 'si michael villareal ay natagpuang patay sa hindi kalayuan ng iyong lamesa nung pumunta ang officer namin sa pinang-yarihan ng insidente. nakita mo ba ang kanyang katawan nung tumakbo ka palabas ng office?' tanong ng isang officer. halos malaglag ang panga ko sa mga narinig ko at tumitig sa dalawang pulis habang balisa at nanginginig sa takot. 'hi.. hi.. hindi,' pabulong akong nag-salita, 'hindi ko maintindihan,' 'sinaksak s'ya hanggang sa mamatay gamit ang malaking kutsilyo. ang katawan n'ya ay balot ng dalawampu't-tatlong saksak,' paliwanag ni manlapig. 'at nakita namin ang kutsilyo ay nakabaon sa bibig nito, dahilan para dumikit ito sa sahig diretcho sa lalamunan,' 'may rason kami para pagsuspetyahan na ito rin ang sinasabi mong kutsilyo,' dagdag pa ng pangalawang officer. nakatitig ako sa dalawang pulis officer ng tahimik, hirap akong intindihin ang mga pangyayari lalo na't ang utak ko ay halos mawala na sa ulirat. 'ang mga sinabi mo ay nagpapatunay lamang sa mga natagpuaan namin sa cell phone ni michael villareal. nalaman namin na may roon siyang hacking apps,' pagpapatuloy ng senior officer. 'natagpuan din naman ang ilan mo pang mga hubong larawan at ang mga mensahe na iyong nabanggit. mayroon s'yang baril at nakita rin naman ang basyo ng bala nung binaril ka n'ya habang papatakas ka.' 'ang hindi namin maintindihan ay kung papaano s'ya namatay.' dagdag pa ng pangalawang officer, halatang hindi s'ya naniniwala sa aking reaksyon. 'ok lang kung napatay mo s'ya dahil sa self-defense, aya. may balak s'yang masama sa'yo.' 'hindi,' pautal-utal kong sagot. 'pangako, wala akong ideya... oh, oh my god.' naiyak na ako dahil sa mga nangyayari. 'ibig kong sabihin, nung nakaraang buwan lang may nag-report sa kanya galing sa isa n'yang co-worker,' sabi ni manlapig. 'jennah,' bulong ko. 'kilala mo si miss espiritu?' tanong ng pangalawang officer, at ng suspetya sa kanyang mga mats. 'hindi,' ako ang pumalit sa lamesa n'ya at nakuha ko ang notebook n'ya. dapat sinabi ko na 'to kanina pa. anong sabi sa report? doon nga ay nagtitigan ang dalawang pulis at maka-lipas ang ilang sandali ay inilatag at ipinaliwanag ni manlapig ang mga hindi magandang nangyari kay jennah na halos mangyari na sa akin. si jennah espiritu ay dumiretcho sa pinaka-malapit na hospital mula sa kanyang unang night shift tatlong buwan na ang nakakaraan. sobrang bugbog ng katawan n'ya at sugatan, at gustong mag-file ng anonymous rape kit. ang natanong damage n'ya sa kanyang puwerta ay sobrang severe na kinailangan n'yang sumailalim sa operasyon at magpatahi. nag-file s'ya ng police report makalipas ang dalawang buwan matapos s'yang hindi pumasa sa probationary period sa inyong kumpanya, ng nawala s'ya sa trabaho (ang nagiisang paraan para mabayaran ang kanyang utang sa hospital). ang nangyari ay ang kanyang aligasyon kontra kay michael villareal, na gumastos s'ya ng malaki sama mo pa ang hindi mabilang na kanyang mga co-workers na kumontra sa kanya laban sa magalang at kaaya-ayang katangian ni michael. 'pero kahapon lang ay iniurong na n'ya lahat ng mga isinampa n'yang kaso kay michael,' sabi ng walang badge na pulis. 'kasalukuyan naming inaalam ang kinaroroonan ni espiritu para ma-interview namin s'ya. sigurado ako na ngayon malinaw na kung bakit may suspetya kami sa iyo bilang nakikilala mo espiritu.' nagpatuloy ang mga tanong ng dalawang pulis hanggang may isang lalaki na nag-abot sa kanya ng isang sobre. natukoy na ng forensics ang fingerprint na nakita sa kutsilyo at ang blood-spatter patterns. kinailangan ko ring mag-submit ng dna samples para maka-tulong sa imbestigasyon at sa wakas ay pina-uwi na nila ako. sa bahay, dahil sa sobrang pagod, hindi ako maka-tulog. wala akong gamit na naiuwi. bag, cell phone at kahit ang jacket ko ay kinailangan i-submit bilang ebidensya. kaya naman napilitan akong gamitin ang luma kong laptop, umaasa na malibang sa internet. ang browser ko ay naka-login pa rin sa linkedin account ko mula sa nakaraang login, at nirefreshed ko ang page bilang naka-sanayan. isang maliit na red icon ang lumitaw na mayroon akong bagong mensahe. jennah. nagre-reply na s'ya sa akin. don't worry, sis. i took care of it. ❤️",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/t77k69/tagalized_story/,5 03 2022
"Naniniwala ba kayo sa mga maligno, engkanto, kaluluwa, atbp.","i had this experience recently. around 9 pm na ako nakarating mula sa amin sa cubao to our subdivision kung saan ako nagboboarding sa san jose city, nueva ecija ,(doon kasi ako nag-aaral sa clsu) then sa isang street may isang bahay na tinatayo pa lang na sobrang madilim dahil walang ilaw. as i passed the house, may narinig ako na umiiyak, in-ignore ko lang kasi baka nga may sanggol talaga doon. after few meters, may puno at grassy part, iba naman ang naririnig ko, tumatawa naman. medyo creepy at tumindig talaga ang balahibo ko. tapos pag dating ko sa boarding, wala yung caretaker sa kabila at yung ilaw sa cr ay patay-sindi. then after few days umuwi na ako samin sa qc. sa 5th floor kami nakatira, sumakay ako sa elevator, mag-isa lang ako. pinindot ko ang number 5. after few seconds, umilaw ang 4. hindi ko naman pinindot. nang tumapat na sa 4th floor, bumakas ang elevator pero walang pumasok, pero may narinig ako na tumatawa. inignore ko na lang. baka kako may batang nagpindot sa labas ng floor. pero imposible e. sa loob umilaw. then nito lang ay nagkasakit ako, ilang araw din na masama ang pakiramdam ko. nagbakasakali ako na baka connected to sa experience ko nung nakaraan. ilang beses na rin kasi ako nagkasakit dahil mga ""hindi nakikita"" na yan. since bata pa ako madalas may ganyan nang karanasan. sabi ko sa nanay ko na ipatawas ako (nasa laguna siya). ayon sa tawas, may babaeng kaluluwa daw na nagkakagusto sa akin. sa puno nakatira. lagi raw nakasunod sa akin at inaadvise-an ako nung nagtawas na magsuot palagi ng pula. nakita rin niya sa tawas na nakadagan sakin yung multo. sobrang creepy talaga. may isa rin akong nakilala na student na doon din nagdodorm sa subdivision na yon. lalaking maligno naman ang nagkakagusto sa kanya. ilang araw din nagkasakit yon. i know na hindi para sa lahat ang story na to. kahit ako dati e. di naman naniniwala. di naman pwedeng mamilit. hehe sa mga naniniwala. may mga similar experiences ba kayo?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ypbv38/naniniwala_ba_kayo_sa_mga_maligno_engkanto/,8 11 2022

Dookki Gateway Mall 2 branch - From bad food experience to Gateway Admin Office to Barangay Hall!,"&#x200b; pa rant lang po, d lang talaga fair sa kung paano na handle ng dookki yung situation at kung san pa kami dinala at napunta. specifically gateway mall 2 branch. franchise daw sila, meaning iba iba may ari ng dookki, hindi iisa, so baka dito lang sa branch na to panget yung food and service. d ko nilalahat yung dookki, eto lang talagang branch na to. hays. &#x200b; p.s. pwede ba ako mag post ng honest food review sa fb ng hindi ako hahabulin ng dookii legally? thank you sa mga sasagot! &#x200b; warning: long post :( may short at long version po, pili na lang kayo kung ano pasok sa time nyo huhu. \------------------ short version (yes short na talaga yan eh) \-------------------- \-brought my parents sa recently opened dookki korean buffet. we were 3. \- ""kumain"" ng 5-10 minutes. wala nga kaming naubos na isang buong kahit ano. \-nagreklamo kasi malamig food, wala lasa pagkain, at may mga langaw. \- imbes na mahanapan ng resolution na both parties agreed to, manager and owner(whom he talked to on the phone) decided to call guards and bring us to gateway admin office instead without informing us. nagmuka kaming eat and run. d nga kami lumabas mismo ng buffet. sumama si manager. \- dun sa admin office, after they heard both sides, manager offered a resolution. wala pa daw sagot si owner sa phone, pero 1 person na lang daw bayaran. sagot na lang daw nya yung 2 na tao. then we agreed. \- after going out for a while, returned and retracted his resolution. d daw pumayag owner. ano kaya yun. pwde naman nya d na lang sabihin sa owner na kami yung nagbayad sa part na sasagutin nya kung genuine sya sa sinabi nya before dba. eh ayun d nagkasundo ulit. was escorted next to barangay hall. \- after barangay heard both sides, they fairly judged that to make both parties happy, we should at least pay half. the bill was 550 each, total of 1650 for 3. so mga 800 na lang babayran namin. \- but owner (manager called again) decided to sue us, kasuhan na lang daw kami. mas gusto ni owner magsampa ng kaso na pwede mas malaki pa ilalabas nyang pera sa lawyer, sa papers, etc. , instead of giving any discount. \-barangay knows that this case was too small and too hassle, and nakakahiya na iakyat pa yung ganitong klaseng kaso sa isang gov. agency (3 letters d ko na matandaan) kasi maliit na bagay lang. \-barangay offered to shoulder half of the payment (800), wag na lang daw ituloy yung kaso. kasi yun nga una, nakakahiya daw, pangalawa, hassle rin kasi maliit na bagay pwede pag usapan. \- pumayag kami para lang matapos na. 3-4 hours lumipas , tapos parents ko at ako gutom pa rin. kaya nga dapat d kami pumayag na maglabas ng kahit magkano eh. tsaka magmumuka kaming hindi cooperative kung inayawan pa namin yung half half na settlement. ending: \- owner gets the full amount and wins (ayaw talaga kasi asikasuhin ng barangay kasi nakakahiya at hassle talaga para sa maliit na bagay mag sampa ng kaso sa gantong amount and klase.) \-nawalan 800 pesos kasi d naman kami kumain talaga. \- gutom pa rin kami pagkatapos -\_\_- &#x200b; &#x200b; \------------------------------------ long version \-------------------------------- bagong bukas yung dooki korean buffet dun sa bagong gateway, so nag plan ako dalin parents ko dun para ma experience namin, we haven't tried any other branches yet. pumunta kami ng mga bandang 1-2pm. nung pakuha na ako ng sarili kong food, may langaw sa maki/sushi, pero d ko na lang pinansin binugaw ko na lang. so eto yung mga reklamo ko sa food by order of consumption: &#x200b; sushi/maki \- cold, below room temperature, hindi lang yung hindi mainit, malamig talaga. \- matigas yung kanin parang lumang kanin or parang yung sa bahay lang galing na d maganda pagkakasaing. sabi ko baka makabawi sa chicken... \- malamig rin. mas malapit sa matigas kesa sa malambot. &#x200b; parang nawawalan na ako ng gana. sana masarap naman tong chapchae nila.. \- malamig \- walang lasa, literal walang asin or kahit anong flavor akong matikan, noodles na malamig lang. (mas may lasa pa yung chapchae ng bon chon) &#x200b; tinanong ko parents ko naman kung nag eenjoy ba sila baka ako lang kasi maarte. ayun sabi rin nila hindi masarap food. &#x200b; so mga 10 min lang kami kumain sa table, hindi kasama yung time na paghahanap ng food na mga 10-15 minutes. parang wala na rin kasi mapili masyadong food eh. konti lang compared sa ibang buffet, parang d sya considered na buffet sakin. mali ko lang d muna ako umikot sa food, kasi inassume ko na pag buffet marami talaga pagpipilian. so kesa makahanap pa kami ng ibang food para makabawi dun sa mga malalamig na food, wala na masyado pagpipilian talaga. so ayun, kesa sa pilitin namin na ienjoy yung food kahit d naman talaga, nag decide na ako magreklamo, and sana full refund, kasi parang yung kinain naman mga worth 100 lang, tapos yung food na d nagalaw nasa tancha ko mga 200-300 pesos lang. pero okay na rin ako sakali kung d pumayag, kahit 1 person na lang bayararan namin. ayun eto na mga ganap. &#x200b; sabi ko sa parents ko wag na sila kumain, then called a manager. we expressed our concerns, na saglit pa lang kami kumakain, na malamig pagkain, etc. umalis saglit, d ko alam san nagpunta. tapos bumalik, sabi nya bawi na lang daw sila next time. ano yun? panong bawi eh ano gagastos ulit kami diun eh ayaw na nga namin kumain ulit dun. tapos pagbabayarin pa kami dun sa kinain naming kokonti? ano kaya yun. sabi ko hindi naman pwede ganun lang. ayun umalis ulit. nung bumalik samin, yung leftover daw d na daw ichacharge samin (meaning neto need pa rin namin mag pay ng full amount.) eh magkano lang yung charge na yun 250, tsaka babayaran mo lang talag yun kung may tira eh. eh mismong yung pagkain nga d namin gusto kaya naging tira. ayun umalis ulit. kung iisipin, pwede naman ding ang ginawa nya is mag sorry at mag offer ng new food na mainit, pero hindi eh. eto sana pwede nyang sinuggest samin nung una pa lang, kaso mainit na ulo ko nung time na yun kasi d maayos pagkakahandle nung manager, tsaka late ko na naisip, nung nasa barangay hall na kami. oops lumaktaw na ako haha, balik ako sa kwento. bumalik samin, nag spill ng script si manager! halata na medyo kinakabahan, tapos scripted yung sinasabi nya. na parang wala silang magagawa ganun chu chu pero sa english syempre. eh alam naman nila na kakapasok lang rin namin. bakit d magawan ng paraan to? ayun biglang umalis sa kalagitnaan ng script nya, baka may tumawag sa kanya sa labas. so ayun, napansin na namin kaya pala sya umaalis is para tawagan yung boss nya, which is yung mismong owner nung franchise. i learned na franchise lang sila, at hindi iisang big food company, which means hindi iisa may ari, iba iba per franchise. i learned this nung nasa barangay hall na lang rin. &#x200b; nagantay kami ng mga 20-30 min, pero wala pa ring sagot pa daw si owner. we suggested to pay at least for 1 person for 550 kahit sa totoo lang hindi aabot ng 200 pesos yung dinala naming food sa table. ang tagal kasi gawan ng paraan naiininip na kami, d naman namin pwede galawin yung pagkain kasi nga syempre nagrereklamo kami sa food. nakatunganga na lang kami bale. ang tagal talaga eh. so ayun sasabihin daw nya sa owner kung pwedeng 1 person na lang bayaran. &#x200b; may napansin mom ko sa buffet, ang daming langaw. sabi ko sa kanya picturan nya in case, kung ayaw nilang pumayag magparefund, pakita na lang natin na may mga langaw food nila. which is totoo naman. kaso nung kukuha na ng picture mom ko, nagsialisan, kaya wala tuloy kaming kuha. ang kuha ko lang is may video ng 1-2 langaw, pero nasa table lang, d ko lang alam kung pwede magamit sa kanila yun in any case, kung counted pa rin ganun. &#x200b; so nag antay ulit kami. maya maya, napapansin ko na may mga guard na sa labas ng dookki. weird lang kasi medyo marami, mga 3-5? tapos d lang sa iisang lugar, parang nakakalat sila sa labas. d ko na lang muna pinansin. pero maya maya pinuntahan nakami tapos dinala kami sa mga guard, tsaka lang nya sinabi na sa admin office ng gateway na lang daw namin i settle yung problema. eh para samin, bakit pa idadamay mismong gateway kung kaya naman pag usapan to within the 2 parties? ang lala naman ng ganun, nagmuka tuloy kaming eat and run. d bale kung naka eat nga eh. tsaka kung nag run, mismong d nga kami lumabas ng buffet. sino ba d maiinis? yung pwede pag usapan, pinalala pa at dinamay yung gateway? d ko magets ano nangyayare. ayun, dinala na kami sa admin office, kasama yung manager. &#x200b; pagdating dun sa office, nag explain kami ng sides dun sa admin. may iba ring tao, mga security ata mga 3-4 sila. sinabi lang rin namin ulit yung reklamo dun sa food ng buffet, at wala kami masyado nakain, etc. sinabi namin dinala na lang kami dito ng d namin alam, na ayun nga d pa nga namin alam feedback ni owner dun sa offer naming payment na 1 na tao. sino ba d maiinis sa ganung outcome eh. maya maya, pagkatapos mag explain both sides, si manager wala pa ring sariling desisyon, labas ulit ng office para tawagan si owner. &#x200b; after a while, bumalik sya, sabi nya wala pa raw reply, pero sasagutin na lang daw nya yung 2 persons para lang matapos yung issue. &#x200b; edi ayun ""dapat"" tapos na yung issue, nagsalita na kasi sya eh. pumayag na kami, 550 yung babayaran. wala akong barya, binigay ko 1k. balik na lang daw sya sa dookki para suklian at bigyan kami ng resibo. narinig lahat ng tao dun sa kwarto pati admin at security sa usapan. &#x200b; ayan happy mood na ulit ako kasi tapos na yung problema eh. nakipag kwentuhan na rin kina admin, etc. mabait rin sila kahit mukang nakakatakot, kasi security iba dun eh, nakakaintimidate lang, share lang. so lumipas 20 minutes, ayan nakabalik na rin sya sa wakas. kaso nung pagpasok, parang 1k pa rin hawak nya. ayan na nga. sabi samin, d daw pumayag si owner na sya magbayad, dapat daw kami... kung nasa kanya naman daw, walang problema sagutin nya yung 2 na tao. &#x200b; ahm... eh kung d na lang nya sinabi sa owner na sya yung magbabayad at sinabing kami yung nagbayad para tapos na? parang d naman naging valid at genuine yung pagiging makatao nya sa rason nya. kung nasa kanya? eh kung nasa kanya naman pala, eh di di na lang nya sana sinabi na sya magbabayad, para matapos na. so ano? ang hipokrito naman nun. lumalabas na insincere syang tao. gusto nya lang lumabas na genuine sya, pero d naman siguro halata na nagbago lang isip nya? may nakausap siguro pagbalik nya sa dookki, kaya nagbago isip. &#x200b; eto, d na ulit nagkasundo, sabi ni admin, dalin na daw eto sa barangay. ayun na nga. daming eme. &#x200b; sabi namin sige, ganun lang rin naman mangyayari ulit, kung ano nangyare ngayon. &#x200b; ganun pa rin ganap, pagdating sa barangay hall ng cubao, nag explain both sides. pero ang pinagkaiba lang sa side nila, meron silang picture na nung pagkain namin, na before wala. pinapamuka nila na kung d naman daw kami nag enjoy bakit andaming food sa table. eh malamang kinuha yun nung una pa lang. d naman ibig sabihin nun nag enjoy na agad. tapos kwento 30-40 minutes daw kami nandun, kasi may timer daw yung induction stove nila dun sa ginamit namin dun sa soup. nag- iba na panig nila, pinapalabas na nila na kumain kami tapos gusto naming tumakbo. hay kaloka. &#x200b; nakakapagod mag kwento ang haba, pero patapos na. &#x200b; paigsiin ko na kasi paulit ulit na yung iba dun sa sinabi namin sa admin office. so ayun, nag intervene ang barangay. para walang away daw, kalahti na lang bayaran namin. pero sinabi namin sa barangay , kahit anong discount ayaw naman bigay ng dookki. tinanong nila ulit si manager para matapos na, ayun. labas ulit. call owner. bumalik. ayaw pa rin daw ng owner. magsasampa na lang daw sila ng kaso... &#x200b; sabi namin sige lang, magsampa kayo ng kaso. alam kasi ni dad na mas mahal pa magagastos nila sa lawyer at sa iba pa, para lang asikasuhin yung kaso para sa 1650, kaya d rin kami natatakot, tsaka sincere naman talaga kami sa reklamo namin, d naman kami eat and run. ayun, medyo nasisiraan na rin ng ulo mga barangay sa side ng dookkii, kasi d man lang mag adjust kahit konti. &#x200b; pero kung gusto daw talaga nila magsampa ng kaso, need daw nila ng spa. si manager daw mag aasikaso nun. by that time, medyo halata na napapagod na si manager, kasi d sya makakilos, wala syang sariling desisyon, tapos d nya na alam gagawin pagdating sa mga legal stuff. eh wala eh sabi sa kanya ng owner nya na magsampa, so wala syang choice talaga. &#x200b; pero sa totoo lang, ayaw rin ipatuloy ng barangay yung kaso, kasi nakakahiya daw i escalate pa daw to dun sa gov ageny na nabanggit, 3 letters yun d ko na maalala sorry d talaga familiar sakin, parang ngayon ko lang narinig. nakakahiya daw kasi maliit na bagay lang tsaka maliit na halaga, na kaya naman daw pag usapan, pero pinaabot pa sa kaso. tingin ko rin medyo may hassle rin sa side nila, d ko lang alam ano mga gagawin nila talaga. masasabihan rin siguro sila na simpleng issue d nila maayos, kaya ayun ayaw nila magkaron ng record. &#x200b; so kesa daw ituloy yung kaso, sabi ng barangay, sagot na daw nila yung kalahati. bayaran na lang daw namin yung 800. &#x200b; para sakin lang, d dapat kami pumayag kasi sa dulo kami panalo eh, kasi mangyayare d rin matutuloy kaso kasi una, oras na magagamit nila, pangalwa, yung gastos nilan sa lawyer, etc. . para magdemanda ng 1650 pesos. &#x200b; pero ayun pumayag na lang rin kami sa half. para tapos na. pumayag kami kasi: \- magaling magsalita yung barangay, persuasive, people person, kaya mapapaoo ka na talaga \- pag kumontra pa kami dun, lalabas lang rin na ayaw rin namin makipag cooperate \- ayoko na rin ma stress parents ko. &#x200b; so ano nangyare sa huli \- nakuha nila full amount, 800 samin, 800 galing barangay \- gumastos ng 800 para sa food worth 100-200 \- at pinaka nakakainis sa lahat, gutom. pa rin. kami. &#x200b; so kumain na lang kami sa iba. so gastos is 800 + 500 = 1300 para sa simpleng pagkain lang. &#x200b; ayun salamat sa pakikinig. nakakainis lang talaga eh. pera is pera. may right naman tayo umayaw sa food kung d naman talaga masarap, at alam mo sa sarili mo na d ka umabuso. &#x200b; &#x200b; &#x200b; &#x200b; &#x200b; &#x200b; &#x200b; &#x200b; &#x200b; &#x200b;",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/17iomjd/dookki_gateway_mall_2_branch_from_bad_food/,28 10 2023

&nbsp; paglilinaw: ang hindrance sa ating progress na humihila sa'tin pababa ay hindi ang criticism o pagpuna sa'ting government officials, kundi ang ating intolerance at galit sa criticism. maganda ang sinabi sa [article na ito](https://www.manilatimes.net/2020/03/19/opinion/columnists/topanalysis/criticizing-as-a-form-of-civic-duty/704176). habang hindi naman tayo gumagawa ng threats o nagdudulot ng harm sa'ting kapuwa, walang masama sa pag-express ng frustrations o konting humor sa mga mali sa ating lipunan at gobyerno. mas ok pa rin yung aware tayo kesa magpikit mata tayo na parang mas mahal na natin ang isang public servant kaysa sa bayan. balansihin din natin. hindi ito pagrebelde o pakikipaglaban sa gobyerno, kundi pag-call out ng inefficiencies at incompetence, at pagsuporta na rin sa checks and balances ng ating lipunan para hindi maabuso ang kapangyarihan. at hindi komo nagrereklamo, hindi ibig sabihin wala tayong ibang ginagawa. si leni nga andaming reklamo ng lugaw na yan, pero halos araw-araw ring nagtrabaho simula day 1. ang gusto lang namin kay leni, kahit kailan hindi siya pagalit mag-voice out ng criticism at malumanay siyang nagbibigay ng suggestions for improvement. kaya marami rin ang akala ay mahina at walang political will si leni kasi malumanay siya. pero hindi siya mahina kundi matapang. isipin mo, presidente na mismo ang pinupuna niya, kahit alam niya ang negative effect sa image at popularity niya dahil alam naman niya ang kultura nating mga pinoy na napaka-allergic sa criticism. kita naman natin ang backlash sa facebook posts niya na flooded ng laugh reacts at toxic comments. pero bakit ba talaga si leni nagvo-voice out? ramdam niya ang mga hinanakit ng taong bayan kasi andun siya mismo parati sa ground at may kamalayan siya sa kalagayan ng mga tao. like yung pag-una pa sa dolomite sand, sabi niya ito raw ay [insensitive](https://mb.com.ph/2020/09/08/manila-bay-white-beach-an-insensitive-plan-in-time-of-pandemic-solon/) kasi magbuhos sana dapat muna ng lahat ng resources at attention sa pandemic, which is a valid point 'di ba? dahil alam niyang kapag mas mabilis maka-return to normal ang labor force natin, mas mabilis aangat muli ang ekonomiya natin. &nbsp; ##2. puppet si leni ng oligarchs! &nbsp; paglilinaw: unlike sa panahon ni cory na may injustices laban sa mga magsasaka, kahit bago pa si leni tumakbo for any public office, no political plans or agenda, bilang lawyer ay mahusay niyang ipinagtanggol na pro bono (walang bayad) ang maraming marginalized sectors. halimbawa ay ang paglaban niya para sa mga lupa ng sumilao farmers against sa conglomerate by the name of san miguel corporation. naipanalo nila ang kaso laban sa mga elite. kaya hindi nakakapagtaka kung bakit todo ang suporta sa kaniya ng mga [sumilao farmers](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/779322/sumilao-farmers-to-march-not-for-land-but-for-robredo). iba iba rin ang ugali ng individual na members ng mga partido, hindi lahat masama o lahat mabuti. halimbawa, sina cory at duterte ay parehas na kabilang sa pdp-laban, na sinimulan naman ni ninoy. kakapalit lang din ni sara recently. makikita rin natin sa saln ni leni na hindi siya kasing yaman ng most politicians, kaya noong sinampahan siya ng kaso ni bbm, may volunteers na nagbuo ng [crowdfunding campaign](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/803171/piso-para-kay-leni) to support her legal fees. anong ginawa niya? at her own personal risk, she politely declined to avoid graft at ipinamahagi lahat ng funds sa angat buhay program, especially sa housing projects sa marawi. see [here](https://gogetfunding.com/piso-para-sa-laban-ni-leni/) for more details. also search for ""jeanette concepcion patindol piso para kay leni"" on facebook. this speaks volumes about her integrity. isa pa, her office consistently received the highest audit rating from coa for [3 straight years](https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2021/6/29/ovp-highest-audit-rating-coa-third-straight-year-.html). ilang beses na tayong umasa sa mga napakagandang pangako ng mga politiko, so it might help if i-apply natin ito sa **lahat** ng ating candidates: kahit gaano kaganda ang mga pangako, plano, at plataporma ng kahit sinong candidate, kahit gaano kagaling siyang magsalita, ka-inspiring ang kaniyang vision, at katindi ng kaniyang political will, ang mas reliable indicator ng kanilang totoong character ay hindi ang kanilang words, hindi rin ang words para sa kanila ng naging allies nila or ng sikat na vloggers or influencers, kundi ang kanilang **past actions**. she takes quick actions. at ang lahat ng ginawa niya bilang vp ay **initiatives** lang niya o kusang loob—hindi part ng mandates ng ovp—dahil siya ay isang servant leader. &nbsp; ##3. history is written by the victors! &nbsp; *""napakarami namang infrastructures ang ginawa noon. binenta ng mga dilawan ang mga pagmamayari ng bayan!""* paglilinaw: ang ""history is written by the victors"" and ""corrupt naman lahat, at least may nagawa"" ay tinatawag na fallacious generalizations o mga logical fallacy dahil sa insufficient evidence at overreliance on observations o panlabas na nakikita. kailangan natin makita ang bigger picture para malinawan tayo. graduate ako ng economics sa up kaya kahit nasa 30s na ako at nakalimutan ko na most of my lectures on development economics, kahit papaano ay may kamalayan pa rin ako at paggamit ng critical thinking para ma-separate kung ano ang propaganda at hindi, at kung ano ang nangyari sa ekonomiya natin. oo, napakaraming ginawang infrastructures. walang mali dito kung careful at proper ang pag-spend. ang problema ay maraming cases ng overspending dahil sa cronies at mga rushed projects. read more [here](https://newslab.philstar.com/31-years-of-amnesia/building-spree). meron namang magagandang projects gaya ng san juanico bridge, philippine heart center, lung center of the philippines, dams, at napakarami pang iba. 2 dekada ba naman e. kaya lang napakalaking spending din sa failed investments gaya ng controversial bataan nuclear power plant na ang cost sana sa contract ay $0.65 billion pero biglang naging $2.2 billion. read [here](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2017/ph241/camacho2/). ang malala pa ay ang napakalaking ginastos din sa tinatawag na edifices para magmukhang may progress pero in the long run ay hindi masyadong nakatulong sa ating economic growth gaya ng ccp at manila film center. ang problema, ito ay debt-driven o puro galing sa utang sa world bank. mula around $0.6 billion utang bago maluklok si marcos, naging $26.7b pagkatapos. read [here](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/774774/well-pay-marcos-debt-until-2025). paano natin malalaman kung **overall** ay maganda ang investments natin sa infrastructure? ito ay kung lumago nga ang ating economy. matapos ang 2 dekadang pamumuno niya, anong nangyari sa economy natin? do marcos apologists give you any economic data, kahit ano gaya ng yearly gdp growth rate, o sinasabi lang nila na ""naramdaman at nakita"" nila ang progress at prosperity noon? oo, maganda naman talaga ang simula, pero tignan natin ang long-term effects. tinatawag nila itong ""golden age"" kahit nag-collapse ang economy natin sa early 1980s dahil hindi na tayo makabayad ng utang sa world bank at nagka-recession during his term. see [this image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ekhz98nz5fx8pzqe8306y7-csjhawppy/view) (verifiable at the psa website) sa gdp growth rate ng economy natin under marcos and a more detailed analysis [here](https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/money/content/172779/martial-law-costly-lessons-in-economic-development/story/). ang problema kasi, pinagbabasihan lang nila ang mga nakita nila at own experiences lang. oo, maganda at payapa ang buhay nila, pero hindi nila nire-represent ang buong bansa. bagsak ang economy leading to massive **inflation**, tapos isisisi nila lahat sa next admins. sobrang negative din ng tingin ng marami sa privatization o pagbenta ng government firms kaya isisisi nila lahat sa aquinos, pero may times na mas efficient pa mag-manage ng business ang private sector, kasi nag-invest sila mismo, kumpira sa government na may inefficiencies and red tape. halimbawa, ang bangui windmill farm ay owned and managed by a private corporation. hindi ako dilawan dahil wala naman talagang perfect na adminstration—may injustices din under the aquinos—pero sana aware tayo na iniwan ni marcos na sobrang lubog ang bansa sa utang or [high debt-to-gdp ratio](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gbnetxycvytwzr2_sd_7jod2qdv7klda/view?usp=drivesdk) at bagsak ang ekonomiya. ang privatization ay kahit papaano nakatulong ma-manage ang ating utang. sana wag magbase lang sa outward appearances or facades of progress. tignan natin ang mas malawak na konteksto kung bakit talagang napag-iwanan tayo. at kahit gaano kagaling ang isang leader (kahit pa may photographic memory siya), kagaling siyang magsalita, ka-inspiring ang kaniyang vision, o katindi ng kaniyang political will, ito ang hard lesson sa atin: competence is important but not as important as character. &nbsp; ##4. puro charity lang yan si leni! band-aid solution. di yan para sa long-term progress ng bansa natin! &nbsp; paglilinaw: hindi naman dahil nag-take siya ng initiatives na tumulong ay ibig sabihin noon ay wala siyang kamalayan sa long-term na makakatulong sa economic growth. hindi vp ang nagco-control ng spending natin sa infrastructure. pero graduate si leni ng economics sa up diliman. alam niya ang kahalagahan ng infrastructure kaya itutuloy niya ang [build, build, build](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2021/10/29/2137559/robredo-says-continue-anti-drug-campaign-build-build-build-tweaks?fbclid=iwar12u_l5gubhl7f35bzxzqyu3esc2t965enw7pwpvyxzyhdzq_zfjhiff6s) pero makikinig din siya sa ating best civil engineers para ma-address for example ang ating traffic and congestion sa urban areas. nakita rin natin ang kaniyang efficient management of resources at [achievements](https://www.reddit.com/r/leni2022/comments/qkl0wk/megathread_achievements_and_statements_of_maria/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) as vp kahit relatively maliit ang budget na inilaan sa ovp. at makikinig din siya sa mga experts and our best economists. ang kaibahan sa kaniya, mas confident tayo na hindi niya nanakawan ang kaban ng bayan. alam din natin na maglalagay siya ng professional leaders na nararapat sa bawat department, hindi yung nilagay lang dahil sa pabor o para ma-enforce ang kapangyarihan. &nbsp; ##5. bayaran ang media! &nbsp; paglilinaw: oo, hindi perfect ang media, pero unlike most vloggers na clearly biased, ang media ay much more under threat na mahabla o maaaring makulong kung lumabag ito sa batas. let me illustrate: in case lang naman na sobra kang amazed o hanga kay bbm for ""his"" bangui windmill farm, let's get the facts right. oo, ina-acknowledge natin na he eagerly permitted, facilitated, and inaugurated its construction according to [this opinion piece](https://manilastandard.net/mobile/article/367795). similar to his parents, alam niya kung gaano kalakas ng hatak ng votes ng sights of [big infrastructures](https://opinion.inquirer.net/145027/our-infrastructure-fetish). gamit na gamit nga sa campaign niya halos lahat ng videos ay may kasamang windmill animation. pero tandaan din na ito ay initiated, constructed, and financed not by the government but by the **private sector**. for complete details, see [here](https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=assvkrokksyc&pg=pa83&hl=en&sa=x&ved=2ahukewjdv8ywinvzahuugkykhfugabcq6af6baggeai#v=onepage&q&f=false). pag binasa natin 'yon, si **ferdinand dumlao** ang isa sa nag-initiate ng bangui windmill farm. ngayon itong si **thinking pinoy** inaakusahan niya na mali mag fact-check si rappler. ang claim kasi ni tp ay yung bangui windmill farm ay initiated by bbm dahil si dumlao daw kasi ang ""ilocos norte's provincial special projects manager"" ni bbm. watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bghpacxoxh4&t=14m00s&feature=youtu.be) at the 14:00 mark. pero magkaibang dumlao kasi 'yon. ang under ni bbm ay **hindi** si ferdinand dumlao kundi si **chito** dumlao. read [here](https://www.manilatimes.net/2004/11/23/news/regions/bongbong-furious-at-ilocos-norte-killing-spree/683199). at ang daming naloloko. tandaan, **hindi** reliable source ang napakaraming facebook, youtube, and tiktok videos dahil punong puno ito ng propaganda, ilang taon na. wala sila madalas na reference na binibigay, puro accusation at stories. at kung may reference gaya ni thinking pinoy, mina-manipulate nila to fit their narratives. hindi naman masyadong mahirap pag-isipan kung saan nanggaling ang makinarya ng propaganda. tsaka yung iba rin ay nare-reinforce nalang ng positive feedback ng community nila at ng [dunning kruger effect](https://www.britannica.com/science/dunning-kruger-effect#:~:text=dunning%2dkruger%20effect%2c%20in%20psychology,or%20of%20people%20in%20general). tapos magke-claim ang mga apologist na bayaran ang rappler at abs-cbn na nag-report din naman sa katiwalian under the aquinos at previous admins gaya ng sa mendiola—see this [report by rappler](https://www.rappler.com/nation/mendiola-massacre-anniversary-same-injustices). *hmm... sino kayang candidate na kabaliktaran ni cory at [ipinagtanggol](https://www.manilatimes.net/2016/04/13/news/top-stories/sumilao-farmers-choose-leni/255921) ang mga farmers at mga mahihirap laban sa mga elite?* since they cannot attack the evidence, their tactic is to target the sources (media) at siraan sila. kaya wag naman tayo masyado padala sa mga sikat na influencers gaya ni ka tunying, yung inc na vlogger. ok sana kung mag-cite siya ng sources, kaya lang kadalasan ay chismis style lang. pero mabait naman siya, misinformed nga lang din at feel niya pinagtutulungan siya kaya para sa kaniya, masama tayong lahat. valid naman ang point niya, wag dapat ipairal ang galit. &nbsp; ##edit: i had an idea. what if ang volunteer animators natin ay bumuo ng inspiring video animation, na may nagna-narrate using this explanation? kahit yung 1st, 2nd, at 4th misconceptions lang. para pati yung mga tinatamad magbasa ay ma-enlighten. baka may ma-contact kayo. yung with inspiring music gaya ng kay william capistrano et al. tapos gawing ad. suggestion lang naman. 🙂 &nbsp; **sa counterarguments:** feel free to comment your criticisms and counterarguments. please include suggestions so we can engage in civil discourse at ma-edit and improve pa natin itong mga paglilinaw. &nbsp; **sa gustong mag-contribute ng sarili nilang paglilinaw sa comments:** use this format. *misconception:* *paglilinaw:* &nbsp; **sa mga bukas ang mata:** alam nating she is facing an uphill battle for our nation. kaya nananawagan ako na habang may oras pa, tumindig tayo at humakbang para sa bayan. sa kabila ng takot, sa gitna ng magulong politika at malakas na ingay ng propaganda, let us amplify [the voice of reason](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/mobile/folders/19vdfrfqgfboq0kwqcdiuqydtn_dsoaal?usp=drive_fs) at ating patunayan ang ating malasakit sa bayan.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/qx82zk/replying_to_misinformation_against_leni/,19 11 2021
Di ko alam paano mag “move-on”,"sorry at mejo late na pero di talaga ako makapag move-on. di ko kasi maintindihan. nalulungkot ako. i can’t make sense of whats happening. my parents met in college noong ‘83, aktibista sila. and growing up, palagi nilang kinukwento paano sila noon, yung mga kaibigan nila na bigla nalang nawala, mga na detain, etc. mahirap daw talaga ang buhay noong bata sila kaya sabi ng tatay ko, nagsumikap sila to give us a better future. kahit na may pagkakataon noon na umalis sa pinas, ayaw ng tatay ko. mahal nya ang pilipinas at sabi nya doon lang daw siya. during campaign period, nag h2h sila. pero sabi ng tatay ko, “we are trying our best but just prepare yourself because it looks like we’re outnumbered” kasi ang dami nya daw talaga nakakausap na lbm fanatics talaga. nung nanalo na, sobrang lungkot namin. isang linggo ako umiiyak (even now kapag naririnig ko yung rosas, lol) then i asked my dad at sabi nya lang “tayo nalang muna isipin natin”. pero ang bigat pa rin sa pakiramdam besh. paano ba ako magmomove on? ofw ako ngayon at plano ko na talaga umuwi this year. but i’m scared of the future in the philippines. alam mo yung ayaw ko na isipin at gusto ko sana bigyan ng chance ang bagong administration pero bigla akong may makikitang comment or statement or whatever from them na nakakapang-init ng ulo. naiinis ako. pero i feel helpless and its not good for my mental health na ito nalang pagali ko iniisip. i get headaches na kasi i can’t find a way how to move past this. paano ba?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/v3d9f5/di_ko_alam_paano_mag_moveon/,2 06 2022
Nahihiyang Kakampink,"minsan pag tinatanong ako ng mga tao kung 88m ako ang sinasagot ko, “hindi cia ang binoto ko.” pero pag nararamdaman nilang pink ako, hindi na ako umimiik. parang deep inside may sense of embarassment kasi kung sasabihin ko pa, kasi nga truth be told hindi naman talaga nanalo. at tinatawanan lang ang isang talunan. pero minsan pag mag isa ako, napapaisip ako. “bakit ba hindi ko kayang sabihin sa lahat na kakampink ako? mapapahiya ba ako?” kasabay ng mas nandidiri ako pag iniisip ng mga tao na yung anak ng apo ang sinuportahan ko. pero minsan naiisip ko, baka kaya hindi ko kayang sabihin na “kakampink ako” kasi sa mga ganitong panahon si leni ang image bearer ng kakampink movement, na para bang siya standard ng lahat. hindi ko kasi nakikita ang sarili ko sa kanya. pero sa pinaglalaban ng partido niya, oo andun ako. na oo kakampink ako. pero hindi si mama leni ung image na kaya kong irepresent bilang isang kakampink sa ngayon. kasi di ba, totoo naman eh kung sino ang kandidato mo cia ang anino mo. pakiramdam ko, hinahanda pa ng karanasan ung taong susuportahan ko bilang isang kakampink. hinahanda pa siya ng panahon para sa maraming pagsubok at paghihirap na dapat niyang ayusin para sa bansang pilipinas. siguro sa ngayon, isa akong nahihiyang kakampink. pero pagkaharap ko ang mga kasalungat, nakikita ko na handa silang makinig sakin pag ako ang nagpapaliwanag. nakikita ko na marami silang hindi alam. at hanggang facebook posts lang ang kaya nilang panghawakan. hindi pa nga lang ito ung tamang panahon para makumbinse ko sila na may pagkakataon pa para sa isang masaya at malayang buhay kung pipiliin nila tayo. pero mas tinatatak ko sa sarili ko na “tahimik na kakampink” muna ako. nag mamatyag. nakikisimpatya. nakikishare ng nalalaman niya para sa ikabubuti ng lahat. dadaan lang yang mga yan, pero hindi tayo mapapagod sumama sa laban. ung mga kilala nating kasalungat, pakitaan natin ng maganda. ung hindi kayang iprovide sa kanila ng pinili nila, tayo ang magbigay. may utak at damdamin pa rin maman ang mga tao. hindi man sila sumama sa atin, atleast hindi tayo nag kulang. at sa hinaharap unti unti ko ng ioovercome ang pagiging “nahihiyang kakampink” na ito kasi baka meron iba, may tiwala sakin pagdating sa iboboto ko, pero dahil hindi ako nagpaparamdam wala silang guiding light na nakikita. mahaba habang laban pa ito. sana makapag plano tayo ng maayos at garantisado. higit sa lahat, para sa bansa. para sa kapwa pilipino.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/xyn3mb/nahihiyang_kakampink/,8 10 2022
"Take any job until you find yout dream job, Pride won't buy you bread.","""take any job until you find you dream job, pride won't buy you bread."" — i just wanna share this. take the lesson you think you learn. i wrote this wholeheartedly. when i was studying, my family was not well off. hindi ko afford bumili ng bagay na gusto ko, mahirap lang kasi kami. i graduated highschool and it's time for college— alam kong hindi afford ng magulang ko na paaralin ako. so nag start ako as workinh student, nag apply ako sa jollibee as service crew. naalala ko na one time nakita ako doon ng mga kaklase ko ng highschool na hindi ko naman kaibigan at pinag tatawanan nila ko. ( sabi ko sa isip ko, wow. ang baba ng tingin nila sa service crew?) all around ako sa jb, taga hugas , taga map, taga ligpit, taga serve ng order — gusto ko maging cashier pero dahil baguhan ako, hindi pwede. dun ko din na experience ang salbahing katrabaho. fast forward, naging awake ako sa hirap ng buhay at hirap kumita. habang nag aaral nag trtrabaho ako. nakakapagod, nakakaiyak — may time na gusto ko na mag suicide. medical course ang inaaral ko noon, sobrang stressful. 10 hrs sa isang major subject tapos kinabukasan trabaho. hindi ko alam kung paano ko kinakaya. may time na habang nag tratrabaho bigla na lang akong lumuluha. na over come ko yun, nag trabaho ako sa mcdonald's bilang crew, sa city hall bilang assistant, lahat ng pwedeng diskarte habang nag aaral. ar'yan ang pangkukutsa ng kakilala dahil di naman nila alam ang sitwasyon o dahilan bakit mo ginagawa iyon. but i kept going. pa graduate na sana ako, nasa 4th na ako ng kolehiyo. ngunit may hindi magandang nangyari. kinailangan ko huminto at nag apply ako sa bpo/call centers. (sabi ng ilan na walang alam ay bagsakan ng mga walang tinapos, which is a stereotype dahil hindi totoo. hindi ka makakapasok sa bpo kung wala kang skills at utak.) kinailangan ko suportahan ang pamilya ko at kumita ng mas malaking pera dahil nagkasakit noon ang lola ko. sa makatuwid, mula ng mag umpisa akong magtrabaho, hindi ko na natapos ang kurso ko. (back story: sa college, binubully ako ng professor dahil loner ako, pano lahat ng kaibigan ko noon ay nagibang kurso na at hindi kinaya ang medical course) so masasabi ko nung panahon na ito, nasa kasagsagan ako ng depression. ito talaga ang panahon na umiiyak ako gabi gabi sa sakit ng mga nararamdaman ko sa buhay. i was a mess. 3 years later — yung mga kaibigan at ilang kaklase ko na naka tapos ng kolehiyo, wala silang trabaho. ""hard work pays off"". hindi ko akalain na magiging itaas akk. kung noon na ako ang inuutusan, ako na ang nag uutos. laking pasasalamat ko sa panginoon sa mga nangyari sa buhay ko. kasalukuyan akong nag tr'trabaho bilang manager ng isang kilalang center sa pinas. may ilang beses na nag mensahe sakin ang ilan kong naging kaklase noon, na binully at tinawanan ako , nagpapa tulong silang makapasok. — tinulungan ko naman sila kaya lang hindi kaya. hindi nila maipasa ang exam para makapag trabaho sa center. bakit kaya? nakatapos naman sila at ang yayabang nila noon? ( nakarma ba sila dahil sa pambubully nila sakin at pangmamata nila sa kapwa? ) upang lumawak pa ang aking kaalaman, habang nagtratrabaho pa din, nag aaral ng kursong related sa business, online nga lang pero sa isang unibersidad na. mga bagay na hindi ko kaya bilin noon, ngayon na kaya ko na, mga lugar na hindi ko kaya puntahan noon, ngayon napupuntahan ko na. ngunit nandun pa din ang pakiramdam na kailangan may ma accomplish ako, hindi para sa iba kundi para sa sarili ko. na kahit nasa itaas na ako, hindi ako titigil matuto, hindi ko itetenga ang aking sarili. saludo ako sa lahat ng breadwinners na madaming sinakrepisyo para lang sa pamilya nila. you win this life. life is too short to have regrets, live in the present moment and do your best with this one life given to you. maraming salamat sa pagbabasa.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/117rkjo/take_any_job_until_you_find_yout_dream_job_pride/,21 02 2023

My thanksgiving dinner experience with a BBM family.,"so eto nga guys, nag-punta kami (me (f), my wife (f) my sister and her bf) reluctantly sa invitation ng ilocano-bbm tita na kapit-bahay namin. may pinag-samahan naman yung family kahit papano, before elections super ganda ng communication namin sa kanila kasi kapitbahay namin dito sa canada. saktong usapan lang, nag-dasal kami bago kumain. to be honest, ang ganda nung prayer. as an agnostic, na-appreciate ko naman siya. pero gagi, yung kapatid ko brining-up yung pag-unfriend ko sa tito ko na misogynistic bbm supporter din tapos sabi sakin bigla nung bbm na tita: ""kayo kasi maka-leni kayong lahat diba? dapat di na kayo nagpapa-niwala sa kwento kwento lang. dapat sa totoong news sources lang."" mind you, binigyan ko lang siya nuon ng heads-up na fake yung website source niya (halatang fake kasi no actual sources from credible organizations, news sites, people, also the ones she sent me usually walang https:// (unsecure-doesnt mean all with https:// are legit as well) tapos yung design nung buong site, parang cult na may agila, illuminati sht - web designer and dev ako) tapos kinimkim pala niya yun. di ko nalang tinuloy yung pag-rebut ko kasi yung wife ko natatakot na magalit ako. i was very polite about it kasi mas matanda siya sakin and i was just looking out for her. then na-bring up nanaman ng kapatid ko about yung recently nangyari kay leila de lima. gagi nagulat ako sabi ng panganay niyang babae, ""dapat pinatay na nila yun. tinuluyan na dapat sinaksak."" sabay silang pamilyang tumawa (aside sa bunso na awkward sa situation) i felt chills. paanong nakakapag-dasal ng ganun kaganda tapos without any hesitations, would wish harm on other people just like that. ps. sinabihan din nung bbm tita yung mom ko directly bakit ako nag-cocomment and nag-popost na kumakalaban sa views niya. tas sabi ni bbm tita ""isang post mo nalang eh sasampalin na kita."" sabay tawa. eto din isang kinagalit ko sila yung traditional toxis filipino family. lakas nilang i-body shame yung asawa ko sa harap ko? muntik na talaga nag-liparan ang mga lumpia. anyways, officially cut ties with them na. may bbm supporter akong mga kakilala pero not that extreme (madalas dahil lang kasi ilocano. &nbsp; &nbsp; (edit) just to answer some questions. &nbsp; > quote q1. why was politics bough up nung dinner? i did not want to talk about politics because i knew it was going to be a mess, pero my sister thought our casual arguments sa fb nuon nung tita is civil and casual. she thought wrong. she had no idea the tita was extremely pro-marcos. she tried to change the topic but we decided na umalis bago magka-gulo (because i get really unpleasant pag nasimulan ko nang magalit and isa yun sa puna ng wife ko sakin kaya ayaw ko siya lalo ma-stress) anywho, lesson learned sa kapatid ko lol &nbsp; >quote q2. di bako sumagot or stoop up for what i believe in? i tried. di sa pag-tanggol sa pagkatalo or sa binoto ko, pero sa misinformation na nagbblur sa totoo at hindi. ang sagot sakin ""naniniwala ka kasi sa fake news. dun ka sa totoong balita lang. wag sa kwento kwento sa facebook at tiktok."" can't argue with people who always things they're right. siya nag-banggit na kay leni kami nag-vote last election and my side of the family all nodded (said ""yes. syempre tita."") then she proceeded to complain about the philippines being poor right now and then overcompensating sa pag-puri kay bbm after niya magreklamo. lol also i don't ever want to stoop low para makipag-sampalan at murahan sa harap nung bunso nila (na awkwardly listening to her mom talk about marcos. i guess she's the ""odd"" one in the family.) &nbsp; >quote q3. but they body-shamed your wife? di ka pumatol? as mentioned i can become harsh pag galit ako. my wife doesn't like me when i'm at that point of anger kaya we just looked at each other and signaled na umalis na. although i told them my wife is building strength kasi nag-ddeadlift siya. di nila alam ata kung ano yun. tbh nung tumahimik ako, napansin nung bf ng sister ko and akala daw nila may gagawin ako. i'm honestly surprised i held it in like that. i'm quite proud of myself. charot &nbsp; >quote q4. important ba sila sa inyo? nung bago-bago palang kami sa canada isa yung tita na nagshashare ng food niya samin sa work, nag-lolook out for us and genuinely concerned if we were okay. kaya masakit din na this happened. &nbsp; >quote q5. anong nangyari sa fresh lumpia? binigyan kami ng pa-take home pero wala na gusto kumain. binalik ko yung plate nila kahapon pero di ko na kinausap. iniwan ko nalang sa pinto nila. &nbsp; &nbsp; >quote edit: clarified that not all websites with ""https://"" are legit din.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/y1fwdi/my_thanksgiving_dinner_experience_with_a_bbm/,11 10 2022

Why will a second lockdown kill the economy?,"pwede ba nating pagusapan kung bakit papatayin ng second lockdown ang economiya natin? isa din akong business owner and truth be told masakit yung unang lockdown (2 months). pero sa totoo lang pabor ako sa isa pang lockdown. pero tingnan muna nating kung ano ang situation ngayon 1. marami ng nagsara dahil sa unang lockdown 2. yung level ng consumer sa malls and even sa ibang establishment is hindi pa bumabalik 3. service sector kahit iopen pa yan ng iatf sa gcq, is practically dead too. 4. interconnected ang mundo, kahit hindi tayo mag lockdown if walang demand mag sasarado pa rin ang mga factory sa industrial park mga bagay na dapat gawin ng gobyerno 1. ibalik ang confidence ng publiko na gumastos ulit. paano? kailangan walang pangamba ang tao na manganganib ang buhay niya pag asa labas siya. (hindi nakakatulong ang punong ospital dito) 2. walang tulong pinansyal para sa mga negosyo. marami ng ngsara. pero siguro naman kung mag lolockdown tayo ng pangalawang beses may pondo na sila para dito. 3. kailangan ng isa pang sap. kailangan umikot ang pera. nung nalift ang ecq, back to normal ang sales ko. and sa tingin ko dahil ito sa sap. may pang gastos pa ang mga tao. iba na ang sitwasyon sa nakaraang 2ng linggo. 4. hindi pwedeng ang 50% economy 50% health approach. kung lockdown, lockdown talaga. kung economy pinili mo buksan mo lahat. dapat magfocus muna tayo sa isang problema dahil palpak ang approach na pag resolba ng covid at economiya ng sabay",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/i1rpny/why_will_a_second_lockdown_kill_the_economy/,1 08 2020

The 6th Stage: Defiance,"so, ayun na nga. ibang mundo na ang ating gigisingan. the dragon has fully reared its head. duterte coming into power in 2016 was but a tendril of smoke heralding the return of a marcos-with an all new cast of cronies! super. ngayon, sabay sabay natin matututunan ang totoong ibig sabihin ng pagtindig laban sa karimarimarim na dilim. tulad ng paglaban ng mga lolo’t lola, nanay, at tatay natin nung 1972. training wheels are off. totoo nga na papunta na tayo sa exciting part. nakakatakot. nakakapangilabot na yung dating mga binabasa mo lang, napapanuod mo lang sa dokyumentaryo, baka makita mo na sa mundong ginagalawan mo. nung una, i did not know how to cope, so lahat ng brand ng copium tinikman ko. hagulgol. galit. ang bobobo, ang tatanga! nangangako ng aalis na. alexa, show me afams in my area. but curiously, as the most turbulent of the emotions eased, something remained. tahimik lang siya habang inuubos ng kaluluwa ko ang kalungkutan. ngayon na humihina na, mas naririnig ko siya, unflinching and steadfast. i feel defiant, *in a way that i have never felt like in my life*. baka ang tadhana ni vp leni ay hindi ang manalo noong may 9, kundi sindihan ang totoong kilusan. marami satin, siguro parang namatayan ngayon. pero may nabuhay rin. it’s new, tentative. pero it is a force that cannot be denied. rivulets of water that will eventually cleave apart solid stone. yung grit ng mga tao na nanatili hanggang 6:30am para lang makaboto. this anger? this movement? it is ours. it is *us*. there is no taking it away. sabi nga ni vp leni, ang mulat, hindi na muli mapipikit. pretty words if heard a week ago. ngayon, habang hindi makatulog at makapigil sa pagluha ang marami satin, siguro mas naiintindihan natin ang bigat ng ibig niyang sabihin. it is painful because you know. i believe it is that pain and grief that will keep us moving. masakit maging mulat. masakit hindi bumitaw. madalas ko isipin kung paano ba ako magsusurvive sa rehimen na ganito. hindi ko alam ang lahat ng sagot, pero may apat ako na suggestion na pwede pagsimulan: first: alagaan ang sarili. mahaba pa ang gabi. kailangan maganda't gwapo tayo hanggang mag-umaga. eat well, exercise, hydrate, meditate, stay centered, cry if you need to, know when you need to step away. you will need all of yourself during the coming years. second: mag-ingat online. alam naman natin na kasama sa technique ang red-tagging and troll farms. ingatan ang sensitive and personal information. don’t give them anything to work with. third: digital budd(ies) system. kung ang social media ay tool na ginamit para ilubog tayo, that means we can also use it to work in our favor. gamitin para bumunot ng lakas sa isa’t isa. now is not the time to isolate yourself. if you’re not already doing so, follow inspirational folks like chel diokno and walden bello. kahit hindi lang para sa balita, kahit paalala lang na hindi ka nag-iisa. fourth: do not forget who is really at fault. may magandang video si atty luke espiritu sa page niya sa fb (bawal maglink, pero madaling mahanap) explaining why it is not the masses who are to blame. we gain *nothing* from alienating and attacking each other, while evil counts on us staying divided. yung mga nagsasabi na stop helping para mapressure yung gobyerno, i do not think that will work. this is a government that will not care. we will be punishing the wrong people, and their oppressors will twist the truth to turn us even harder against each other. kung vp leni supporter ka, tulad ng marami satin dito, you would be betraying the principles she stands for. kahit yung mga nakain ng fake news and misinformation, biktima lahat yan. hindi natin alam ilang taon unti-unting binabago ng propaganda ang perception nila ng katotohan. the machinery has been hard at work for years. palagay ko, ngayon palang natin totoong sisimulan ang pagrehabilitate. the real evil are the people who willfully and deliberately voted because they had power to gain. the real evil are the structures and elites who produced marcos jr. yakap. mahal kita at ipaglalaban kita, sa kung paano ko man kakayanin. stay safe, stay defiant, folks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/unpff9/the_6th_stage_defiance/,12 05 2022

Bakit nga ba galit ang tao sa (unofficial) pagkapanalo ni Marcos?,"simple: si marcos ay hindi basta kandidato lang. si marcos ay galing sa pamilyang nagnakaw sa, at gumahasa ng, bansa natin. opo, nakasulat 'yan sa kasaysayan at alam ng buong mundo. konting google lang at makikita ninyo lahat ng kawalanghiyaan ng pamilyang 'yan. ni hindi ko nga rin mawari kung papaano tayo umabot sa punto na kinekwestyon pa ang katotohanan ng martial law. makinig tayo sa mga documentaries at mga testimonyo ng mismong mga biktima ng martial law. magbasa tayo ng mga ebidensya na nagpapakita ng paglugmok ng ekonomiya ng pilipinas at kung gaano sila yumaman sa loob ng 21 years na nasa kapangyarihan sila (maaaring basahin: republic v. sandiganbayan. july 15, 2003). kung si ping, isko, leody, o kung sino man sa mga kandidato ang nanalo, wala namang problema. iintindihin naman ang pasya ng taong bayan. ang kaso, ang nakataya sa eleksyon na ito ay isang parte ng kasaysayan natin na maaaring mabura at makalimutan nang hindi pa nabibigyan ng hustisya. hindi naman natin maikakaila na ang lahat ng masamang patungkol sa martial law ay mababalewala sa pag-upo ni marcos. pano mo nga ba naman sisingilin ang pangulo sa lahat ng ill-gotten wealth at tax liabilities? pano mo nga ba naman aalalahanin ang edsa holiday kung ang pangulo mo ay isang marcos na ang pamilya ay pinatalsik mismo sa araw na yan? paano mo nga ba naman ituturo ang katotohanan sa panahon ng martial law sa loob ng classroom kung ang pangulo mo ay isang marcos? isang sagot: hindi na. nanggaling na rin sakanya yan. ""i have to protect my family"". at bago niyo sabihin na magmove-on nalang, andaming mga biktima ng martial law na hindi pa nabibigyan ng reparations. ni hindi pa nga tayo nakakarinig ng sorry man lang mula sa pamilya nila. ni hindi pa nga natin nababayaran lahat ng utang natin mula sa panahon ng ama niya habang sila, ang yaman yaman na. at masakit isipin na basta nalang makakalimutan ang kauna-unahang beses sa kasaysayan natin na ang nagpahirap ng sobra sa bansa natin ay isang pilipino. sige, pwede naman natin tanggapin ang pagkapanalo ni marcos. madali naman 'yun, mapagpatawad naman ang pilipino. pero sa bawat araw na hinahayaan nating bumalik sa kapangyarihan ang pamilyang 'to, unti-unti naring mababaon sa limot ang hinaing ng mga biktima. unti-unti naring mawawala ang pag-asa na maibalik ang ninakaw ng pamilya nila. unti-unti naring mawawala ang hustisya. at kung mangyari man na hihingi ng tawad at mabibigyan ng hustisya ni bbm ang mga biktima ng kanyang ama, at i-angat niya ang pilipinas, edi sige, handa akong ibigay ang respeto ko sakanya. patunayan niya na hindi talaga kasalanan ng anak ang kasalanan ng ama. alam kong nakakainis at nakakapikon na hindi nalang hinahayaan ang resulta ng eleksyon, pero sana alam natin na ang pasakit na ito ay bunga ng malasakit para sa bayan. p.s. pasensya na, just had to let this out of my chest kasi andaming annoying na tao. lol",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/uoh21a/bakit_nga_ba_galit_ang_tao_sa_unofficial/,13 05 2022

Sabi sa akin ng Ante ko ay hindi ako tunay na Engineer dahil walang board exam yung couse ko.,"(***aita for arguing with my boomer aunt over the fact that she claimed i wasn't a true engineer and devalued my nearly three years of work experience in the logistics and supply chain industry by indicating it wasn't profitable****)*. &#x200b; minsan na rin ba kayong binansagang '**bastos**' ng mga nakakatanda na sarado ang isipan sa mga bagay-bagay dahil nagbibigay ka ng mga punto patungkol sa mga karanasan na **mas** alam mo dahil hindi nila naranasan? ako kasi, oo. si ante (**auntie**) ay kilala naming relihiyoso, palasimba at masasabi mo na kapag gumuho ang mundo ay talagang malabo na mapunta sa impyerno dahil halos tatlong beses sa isang araw kung magrosaryo. isa siyang dh sa hong kong at isa namang assistant sa isang simbahang katoliko kada rest day niya. mataas ang respeto ko kay ante dahil sa hirap ng buhay ay nagawa nila ni tatay (nakababatang kapatid ni ante) noon na makapunta sa abroad para magtrabaho. marami na ring naipundar at nakapagpagawa ng bahay. ako naman ay isang simpleng tao lang, nagtapos ako ng kursong **industrial engineer** sa isang kilalang unibersidad sa luzon. bata pa lang kasi ako noon, sobrang naeengganyo ako magbyahe-byahe at maghahatid ng pagkain ng tatay at kuya ko kapag sila ay nasa bukid - masasabi ko na isa ito sa konsepto kung bakit ko pinili manatili at magtrabaho sa industriya ng logistics at supply chain. at noong nagtapos ako sa kolehiyo, ang una kong trabaho ay qc (quality control) engineer sa isang manufacturing company sa valenzuela. ngunit sa sobrang boring ng trabaho ay napilitan ako magresign at pinilit maghanap ng logistics o supply chain company at sa awa ng diyos ay nakahanap naman. dito, masasabi kong masakit sa ulo kasi madami kang kakausaping tao, dapat marunong ka magmando ng operations, magbigay ng tamang update kada oras at magbigay ng assurance sa mga business partners para mapanatili ang maayos na samahan. **maliit ang sahod?** oo. **masaya ba ako?** sobra. nagumpisa ang pangyayari sa pagtawag ko sa ante ko dahil gusto ko siya kumustahin. labis-labis ang pagkamiss ko sa kanya dahil mula ng 2020 ay hindi na siya nakauwi pa ng pilipinas dulot ng covid-19. bandang alas-siyete ng gabi noong october 30 ay napatawag ako. pagkasagot ng tawag, iniisip ko na bubungad sa akin yung linya niya lagi na ""hello, how are you?"" pero hindi, sermon kaagad. mga limang minuto ng paguusap namin ay patungkol sa pinsan ko na nakapag-abroad na at nagtapos bilang nurse at sa isang kakilala namin na masasabi kong marami ng work experience bilang mechanical engineer at 'board passer'. pagkwento niya ay hindi ko maiwasan na hindi maging komportable lalo na't palaging binabanggit na walang board exam ang ie o di kaya maliit lang daw ang sahod ng mga ie. ang tawag pa nga niya sa akin minsan ay **rider** o **delivery boy** kasi ang madalas kong sabihin ay nagtatrabaho ako sa industriya ng logistics at supply chain - at dahil hindi niya alam ang sinasabi ko, ginamit ko ang katagang '*nagpapadedeliver ng mga produkto sa mga mall, tindahan o warehouse*' para madali niya maintindihan yung konspeto ng trabaho ko. nabanggit pa nga na walang pera sa trabaho ko kahit pa pausbong pa lang ako sa sa professional career (almost 3 years work experience) ko at hindi ko nagustuhan ang mga sinabi - na hindi ako tunay na engineer dahil wala akong board exam. pinupunto ko sa kanya na kahit wala kang board exam ay pwede ka pa ring maging engineer. dito pa lang ay nagtataasan na kami ng boses. pinipilit pa rin na pumunta lang daw ako sa ie na course dahil takot ako sa board exam. nabanggit pa niya na hindi siya gaanong proud kasi hindi kilala yung course at hindi ganon katunog. binigyan ko ulit ng isa pang punto na sobrang importante ng mge ie sa mga kumpanya dahil kami ang nagaayos ng mga proseso. makaraang sinabi ko ito, binansagang na akong 'bastos', 'palasumbat' ni ante sabay binabaan ng tawag. sa tawag din ay kinukumpara niya ako dun sa kakilala namin na marami ng nabiling lupa, sasakyan. take note, almost 25 years na nagtatrabaho iyon compare sa akin na magtatatlong taon pa lang. ang iniisip ko ngayon, ako nga ba talaga itong bastos o palasumbat dahil pinili ko magreason-out regarding sa course ko at maging sa trabaho ko?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/yjcckq/sabi_sa_akin_ng_ante_ko_ay_hindi_ako_tunay_na/,1 11 2022
Sino ang mas kawawa? Magulang o Anak?,"i agree: 1. both biktima ng sistema ng lipunan o ng kultura ng kahirapan 2. both pwedeng magkamali sa desisyon sa buhay 3. both biktima ng pagpapasa ng kultura 4. both merong utak at puso na pwedeng magkamali. i cannot put it into words dahil sobrang personal sa akin neto pero tanong ko lang sa magulang dito o magbabalak mag anak sino ba ang mas kawawa ang magulang or anak? kapag nag desisyon na bumuhay ng bata ang isang couple, automatically magulang na sila, whether they are capable or not, they decided to have a child. pero sa lipunan nating ito, laging talo ang anak. wala namang kamuwang muwang ang bata at higit sa lahat hindi namilit na buhayin sa mundong ito, magulang ang nag desisyon na mag anak pero bakit sila pa din ang kawawa? kawawa sila palagi lalo na sa media portrayal kaya lahat tayo na condition na ganon, laging superior ang magulang sa lahat ng bagay, lagi silang kawawa, lagi silang dapat intindihin, lagi sila dapat bigyan ng pagmamahal, hindi ko maintindihan. nakaka awa lang na hanggang ngayon hindi pa rin mabago yan, example na lang sa mini miss u, may mga bata na naaawa sa magulang nila dahil napapagod magtrabaho, gusto na nilang magtrabaho para makatulong sa magulang nila, hindi ba nakaka gago yun na ipinapakita nila sa anak nila na napapagod sila dahil sa anak nila??? na iniisip ng bata na pabigat sila sa magulang nila??? eh hindi naman ang bata ang nag desisyon na mabuhay siya sa mundong ito kundi ang magulang niya? oo na sige na, sistema na may problema pero maaayos ba agad yan? wala bang mga utak o puso ang mga magulang na ito para maisip nila na desisyon nila mag anak pero pinaparamdam o pinapakita nila sa anak nila na mahirap mabuhay dahil sa anak nila? ang anak laging masama ang edit kapag ka humiwalay, nag decide magpamilya , inuna ang sarili, laging susumbatan ng magulang na pinakain, pinalaki sila neto , pinag aral — eh aba dapat lang kasi responsibilidad mo yun bilang magulang? bakit ganyan yung ibang magulang parang nag anak lang para pagkakitaan o para may mag alaga sa kanila sa pag tanda. hindi ba may buhay din yang mga anak? bakit laging kawawa ang mga magulang??? in the first place naman sila nag decide na bumuhay ng bata, kung nahihirapan sila consequence na yun ng desisyon nila? para sa akin, tama na yang paawa edit, kasalanan mo yan kasi nag anak ka?? hindi ko magets yung edit sa media, na parang utang na loob pa ng bata na nabuhay siya, na parang pinilit niya yung magulang na ipanganak siya?? nag anak lang ba ang mga magulang kasi wala silang pangarap sa buhay? nag anak lang ba sila para may mag alaga sa kanila? nag anak lang ba sila dahil sa pressure ng lipunan? pero isa pa rin yang desisyon? at kung ano mang consequence niyan e own up to it?? hindi yung papaawa ka sa ibang tao, sa tv shows, sa radio shows at maski sa harap ng anak mo para magkaroon ng utang na loob sayo at maawa sayo? hindi ko siya maput into words dahil nga personal kong na experience to e , yung pag mamanipula ng magulang, yung pagpaparamdam sa akin na kasalanan ko kung bakit nahihirapan sila, kasalanan ko kung bakit wala kaming makaen, pisikal at verbal abuse ang naranasan ko masakit man o hindi abuso yun para sa akin , at naranasan ko lahat ito mula bata hanggang sa paglaki, nakwento ko na din to sa mga close friends ko pero para sa kanila normal lang daw yun kaya naisantabi ko yung feelings ko. normal na pala na matawag na palamunin kahit bata ka palang. kaya nung nagkatrabaho ako, sobrang saya ko na makatulong pero nung may nabasa ako somewhere dun ako nagising sa katotohanan na, hindi ko dapat naranasan yun kasi bata lang ako that time. umiiyak ako habang tinatype to, si oa pala to eh haha. tumigil sa pagtatrabaho yung tatay ko nung nagkatrabaho na ako, edi malamang ako na naging breadwinner malamang sa malamang di lang ako nakakaranas neto, kaya nung nagising ako dun na bumalik lahat ng alaala ko nung bata ako, na akala ko normal lang yun pala hindi. hindi dapat. tumutulong ako kasi walang choice, kung hindi ako tutulong walang tutulong sa kanila kasi hindi na bila kaya tulungan sarili nila. o diba kawawa na naman sila. pero kelan magiging kawawa ang mga anak na nagsantabi ng pangarap sa buhay, ng oras, ng pamumuhay magisa, ng pagkakaroon ng karanasan katulad ng mga taong may matitinong magulang, kelannn??? hindi lang ako nakaranas neto dahil sigurado ako marami ding naging forced na maging breadwinner sila pero lagi pa ding kawawa edit ang mga magulang sa media portrayal, maski sa lipunan natin, kelan magkakaroon ng narrative na ""ayan anak pa more, alam mong hindi mo kaya nag anak ka pa, ngayon papa awa kang nahihirapan"" like.... hindi pa ba abuso na bubuo ka ng anak knowing na hindi mo kaya?... sa lipunang ito, sa ekonomiyang ito? nakakasawa na at lubos na nakakalungkot makarinig sa mga bata sa tv na kaya sila sumasali sa contest para makatulong sa magulang. hindi ba nahiya tong mga magulang na pinapakita nila sa mga bata yung paghihirap nila? fcking fake it. maawa ka sa bata, ipinaparamdam mo na mahirap ang buhay dahil sa kanya, at kelangan ka bigyan ng award dahil sa paghihirap mo, eh kung pwede namang hindi ka mahirapan kung hindi ka nag decide mag anak. gets ko na may problema sa sistema, pero maaayos banagad yan? hindi talaga pwede sisihin yung magulang sa desisyon nila? nakakainis yung ibang pa woke sa twitter na sasabihin na problema sa sistema yan kaya ganyan ang mga magulang? like so okay lang mang abuso kasi kasalanan ng sistema, hindi talaga sila pwede sisihin sa katangahang desisyon na ginawa nila???? ewan ko, mapa media, mapa woke. laging kawawa ang magulang , laging kelangan may bigger understanding ang mga anak sa magulang ""hindi mo maiintindihan kasi hindi ka pa nagiging magulang"" like bitch may utak ako and i'm in the right mind not to have a child knowing na im not financially capable para buhayin sila i can only speak for myself, for what i experienced, kung ano nakikita ko sa tv at kung ano response ng kaibigan ko sa karanasan ko, and by all of that, it only means na normal lang to pero hindi talaga dapat siya normal. tl;dr media portrayal affects the thinking of filipinos na nakaka awa ang magulang and it is love to be abusive towards children na forced sila to be a breadwinner and maging caregiver sa magulang dahil sa reponsibilities ng magulang masked as sacrifices. this normalizes the abusive culture at dynamics ng magulang at ng anak. hindi nakaka awa ang mga magulang, desisyon nilang mag anak kaya kung mahirapan man sila dapat di sila mag pa awa. mas nakaka awa ang mga anak na hindi naman nila desisyong mabuhay pero mag susuffer sila sa lipunang ito dahil sa desisyon ng magulang nila. knowing this, sino ang mas nakaka awa?

Deeply hurt and disappointed,"long rant ahead. sorry, just had to get this off my chest. i've never been invested in politics until this election season. isa ako sa mga walang pake dati. this was until nagannounce si vp na tatakbo siya. di ko alam bakit pero ilang beses ako naiyak while watching her speech. mas naiyak pa ko lalo nung nakita ko yung overwhelming support that poured online that day. nagulat ako kasi i'm aware of how much she's been vilified for the past years. so it was a pleasant surprise to see suddenly almost everyone i know expressing support. tapos nagtuloy tuloy na. dumami ng dumami yung mga tumitindig. padami ng padami yung mga sumasali sa rallies. yung mga kilala kong apolitical din started to make a stand. sobrang saya ko nun kasi akala ko finally, natauhan na tayo lahat. ayaw na natin sa nakasanayan natin na hirap, gusto na natin ng tunay na pagbabago. i trust the science of the surveys pero naniniwala ako na may milagro pa na pwede mangyari to make vp win. after all, ngayon lang natin nakita ung ganitong level of engagement from the common filipino. kumilos ang mga tao on a scale na hindi pa natin nakita before. nagsipag din naman ang team nila vp. ginawa nila lahat ng pwede. so for me, napakaunfair ng mundo naman if at the end of it all, all the hard work, passion and dedication, those efforts won't be rewarded, especially if it's for the good of everyone. pero sadly, that's not how the world works. ang sakit. nakakatakot. nakakabahala. it's very selfish to say but i feel i've been betrayed by my fellow countrymen. ako at lahat ng tumindig para sa bansa at para din naman sa kanila. basta masakit hahaha anyway, as vp (but to me, the president) said during her mda speech, ""ang minsan nang namulat, hinding-hindi na ulit mapipikit "", this election has changed me forever. and for that, i'm very grateful. i'm sure i'm not the only one. sana lahat tayo handa pa rin ipaglaban ang mga dapat ipaglaban sa mga susunod na taon.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ulsk0e/deeply_hurt_and_disappointed/,9 05 2022

Valentines Break Up,"yung iba siguro excited mag valentines, lalo na mga may jowa. samantalang ako, i'm waiting for valentines for the official break up of me and my boyfriend. sa totoo lang ang tagal ko na nakikipagbreak sa boyfriend ko kaso hindi siya pumapayag. this time, ayoko na talaga, ang dami ko na nasasabi na masakit na salita, nagrequest lang siya na paabutin ko man lang sa birthday nya which is february 13. syempre alam ko curious kayo bakit? ano bang nangyari? actually, kaya rin ako nagpopost dito para humingi ng opinion. bago pa kami magkakilala ng boyfriend ko, kilala na siya sa pagiging loko-loko, lalo na sa pagweweed. literal na bad boy na aayawan ng typical na magulang (pero hindi naman mukhang adik, he's good looking lol). so ayon cut ko na lang yung kadramahan sa first few months ng relationship namin. nagbago naman siya, or that's what i thought. lagi kami nag-aaway dahil may nababasa ako sa messenger nya about marijuana, keso sa kumukuha si ganyan sa kanya, nagtatanong ganto. umamin na rin siya sakin na he smoked weed twice while we are in a relationship. una pa lang naman sinabi ko sa kanya na malaman ko lang isang beses na bumalik siya sa pag gaganon, hihiwalayan ko siya. pero ayon marupok si ate mo girl, umabot pa ng pangalawa or baka lima hindi lang nya sinasabi. bukod sa marijuana, pinag-aawayan talaga namin pagiging sinungaling nya, as in huli mo na nga, may ebidensya na, itatanggi pa at iibahin ang istorya. tangina naman ganyan ba kayong mga lalaki lols. last year, december hindi na rin kami okay dahil nanaman sa mga nababasa ko sa messenger nya, alam nyo yung nawalan na ako ng tiwala sa kanya to the point na wala na akong amor sa kanya. sabi ko nga sa kanya plano ko bago sana mag 2021, magbreak na kami kasi tangina paulit-ulit na lang hanggang sa ayan ayaw nya iyak iyak magbabago nanaman. lumipas ilang bwan okay nanaman kami, hanggang sa netong feb, may nabasa nanaman ako na nagtatanong siya kung may available na weed. may nagpapatanong lang daw sa kanya na kaibigan. ang pangit pa kasi dun, nagdedelete siya tapos chinat nya ung kausap nya na magchat ulit sila ganyan, para bang gumawa sila ng bagong convo ulit para mapakita na nagtatanong siya para sa kaibigan nya. eh alam ko na iba na un kasi di naman yun yung nabasa ko nung una. nakakagigil diba ginagawa pa akong tanga. pinipilit nya na ano ba masama sa marijuana, importante raw hindi na siya gumagamit, tinutulungan nya lang mga kaibigan nya pag naghahanap. sige may point siguro na tangina herbal yan, natural pero ang sakin naman kasi, illegal yon! pwede siya mapahamak at ako, kung hindi nya kaya i-adjust yon at tuluyan alisin sa buhay nya, edi sana humanap siya ng iba na kaya mag-adjust para sa kanya kasi di ko naman pinagsisiksikan sarili ko sa kanya. are my reasons petty? or i should have broke up with him the first time he broke my trust? yun lang di ko sure kung may magbabasa neto pero post ko na lang din kasi wala naman ako napag-oopenan ng tungkol sa relationship ko.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/lavdeu/valentines_break_up/,2 02 2021
Duque waits for poop to hit his briefs before going to the toilet - Report,"*manila, philippines* \-- in a personal interview with department of health secretary francisco duque iii, he mentioned that he waits for his stool to hit his briefs before going to the toilet. ""*alam n'yo*, this is what i really do. doesn't matter if *masakit* na ang stomach *ko*, but unless *may konting tae na dumikit sa briefs ko*, i would never go to the cr,"" duque said, ""it has been my philosophy in life, to never think of contingencies."" bear in mind that duque refuses to impose a travel ban on countries with the new strain of covid-19. ""we need to wait for them to have a community transmission within their country before we impose a travel ban,"" duque added, ""this is despite the new strain being 56% to 70% more contagious, we need to wait for the community transmission."" ""we were successful early this year in imposing a timely travel ban, now we are the fastest to curb covid in asia,"" duque, again, contradicting data. ""*anong plan for the worst? dilawan ka siguro*,"" duque further added, after the news team noticed the stench of poop in the room. as of date, the philippines is still in lockdown with the first wave of covid-19. \------------------------------------------- *this is satire. any resemblance to persons, living or dead, is entirely coincidental or is intended purely as a satire.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/kl4i8i/duque_waits_for_poop_to_hit_his_briefs_before/,27 12 2020
Anybody who had anal fissure/hemorrhoids?,"i have anal fissure for over a year now. una medyo nakakatakot lang kasi nagulat nalang ako na may dugo sa dumi ko, but it was painless. so it just kept happening, theres a bit of blood outside especially over the tail end of the poop but since it was painless hinayaan ko nalang. (napapa kris aquino ako kasi nanlalambot ako pag naiisip ko to hihi). pero isang beses nung nagtubol talaga ako grabe ang sakit, simula noon lahat na ng pagtae ko ang hirap, talagang pagpapawisan at paghahandaan mo ang pagpunta sa cr para makapagipon ng lakas kasi sobrang sakit talaga. the pain would never end there because after i pooped i can never sit straight for hours because of how sore my a-hole was. the only thing i could to relax do was lie down straight. after weeks or months there were periods na nagheal and i think it was back to normal relax pooping and i was relieved, but dumating nanaman ung significant na tubol tapos nag recur nanaman yung blood, and i knew from myself that tomorrow is going to be the start of pain. indeed it was. i have not visited any doctor yet, but the first time i saw blood i didnt tell my parents first pero nung naging concerning na sa akin sinabi ko na, kahit alam kong grabe takot nila. i only searched google for everything about my situation. di ko nga sure kung fissure or hemorrhoids eh. (shocked tlaga sila, kasi may history ng colon cancer line ni papa, si lola namatay due to that) so yon, aside from the pain, there is also the problem of rectal discharge na para bang sinisipon yung pwet (lalo na kapag masakit after pooping magdidischarge talaga. so its been weeks now since i have last encountered blood on my poop. nitong mga recent aftermath ng handaan, wala ring blood (yay) but the pain doesnt end yet. for some reason if i soap my anal area, it stings. i dont know why because i cant see down there pero internal ang fissure dba? so sinearch ko, tumungkol naman sa hemorrhoid wag daw sabunin kasi ma iirritate. ibig sabihin hemorrhoid naman problema ko ngayon, or did i really had both all along? this really changed the game of going to the toilet for me. i can never experience the ""comfort"" in comfort room ever again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/krb2hz/anybody_who_had_anal_fissurehemorrhoids/,5 01 2021

A hard pill to swallow pero need talaga ma-phaseout ang Jeepney for our country to move forward,"bago ako kuyugin ng mga tao dito at sabihang “elitista”, “anti-poor”, o “dutertards/alamano”, uunahan ko na kayo at sasabihin isa lang din akong kapwa mananakay at average worker, walang kotse o motor. with that in mind, can we please hear out the other side of this issue without turning it down? without dismissing it just because “kawawa” naman yung mga jeepnery drivers etc.? tayo ba at kapwa mananakay hindi kawawa, sila lang? don’t we deserve better? puro awa na lang ba? the romanticization of the jeepney phaseout issue is becoming worst day by day. hindi naman sya surprise, yet people are only resisting just now, bakit hindi kayo nagprotesta nung bill pa lang sya? anong nangyari sa loob ng 10+ years na pagsulong ng proyekto na ito, bakit walang ginawang counterproposal itong mga operators at jeepney drivers sa mga taong yun? bakit hindi sila nag-effort? now for better understanding and for those who claims na “agad-agad” daw yung project, well it’s not. it’s actually over a decade of urong-sulong because of the woke resistance: **january 4, 2016** – piston protested at the head office of the then-dotc. it wanted to make sure that the ltfrb and lto would accept the applications for registration of old jeepneys. former ltfrb chairperson winston ginez said a mandatory phaseout would begin in 2017. **(this was one of the earliest reports of cnn philippines about the matter. in 2012, the noynoy aquino administration pushed to introduce e-jeepneys. then-dotc secretary mar roxas said the age limits of puvs over time would be reduced. media reports said the phaseout plan has been issued by the dotc since 2002 but it was not seriously implemented.)** **september 21, 2016** – jeepney operators and drivers warned that they plan to hold a nationwide transport holiday if congress passed a bill that would approve the newly named department of transportation’s (dotr) plan to carry out the puv phaseout program, among other projects. the bill also pushed to give emergency powers to former president rodrigo duterte to solve the transport crisis. **february 6, 2017** – the stop and go coalition called for a nationwide transport strike, the first of many. it affected thousands of passengers and forced the cities of manila and malabon to suspend work and classes. it ended after the ltfrb called for a dialogue. the transport groups were reportedly unsatisfied with its results. **february 27, 2017** – the leaders of transport groups piston, stop and go coalition, and no to jeepney phase out coalition (njpoc) staged another nationwide strike, as a response to the government’s inaction to their appeal to amend the modernization program. some local government units in luzon and the visayas suspended classes, with malacañang also announcing a class suspension for metro manila on the eve of the strike. **june 19, 2017** – the ltfrb announced that the puv modernization program would start after a month under its order called omnibus franchising guidelines. aside from the phaseout, the program would stop giving franchises to single-unit operators. it was also reported that the government-affiliated land bank of the philippines had put up a ₱1-billion credit facility to cover the replacement of some 650 jeepneys, which would cost from around ₱1.4 million to ₱1.6 million per unit. days later, the department of trade and industry released possible designs for a prototype of the modern jeepney. after a few months, transport officials said that by 2020, all puvs would be modernized. **october 16-17, 2017** – jeepney drivers and operators led by piston staged another nationwide strike. the ltfrb claimed it received reports that it was part of a destabilization plot but the group denied the allegation. the ltfrb warned that it would cancel the franchises of operators who participated in the strike. traffic enforcers took photos of drivers who joined the protest, it added. during an event in camarines sur, duterte had some harsh words for members of piston and other protesters, warning them about serious consequences if they didn’t join the program. **december 5, 2017** – george san mateo, piston’s national president at that time, posted bail after he was arrested on dec. 1 for violating the commonwealth act no. 146, or the public service law. the case stemmed from the february piston-led strike. **december 11, 2017** – the senate committee on public service, led by sen. grace poe, conducted a hearing on the puv modernization program. poe said the ₱80,000 subsidy would not be enough to assist jeepney drivers as modern jeepneys cost ₱1.6 million each. but according to her own computation, each unit would actually cost ₱2.1 million at a 6% interest rate per annum if the payment period was seven years. groups led by piston planned to stage a week-long transport strike but called it off because of the hearing. they mounted transport caravans instead. **january 2, 2018** – the dotr said old jeepneys must meet government requirements as determined by a motor vehicle inspection system (mvis), or a roadworthiness test, before they could resume plying their routes until 2020. the agency also said jeepney units must be replaced with euro-4 compliant engines. **january 8, 2018** – transport officials started its tanggal bulok, tanggal usok campaign, where they issued warnings to smoke-belching vehicles and temporary operator’s permits for vehicles with defective parts and accessories. a month later, they cracked down on jeepneys at the university of the philippines diliman and issued citations to 95 drivers. the surprise operation affected students, teachers and employees. the dotr deployed only 10 solar-powered jeepneys to the campus. **march 19, 2018** – the ltfrb released a memorandum circular telling individual operators to join a cooperative or corporation that would operate more than 15 units, or group themselves to form a single juridical entity, by march 2019. this started the industry consolidation component of the puv modernization program. **october 8, 2018** – in a senate hearing, the ltfrb said it will postpone the implementation of the total puv phaseout originally set for march 2019, following opposition from senators and transport groups. but days later, then-transportation secretary arturo tugade said they would continue with the modernization program. **july 15, 2019** – alliance of concerned transport organizations (acto) and piston staged a protest, warning of another nationwide strike if their calls were ignored. efren de luna, acto’s president at that time, said in an earlier forum that they were not against the program but the phaseout had to be gradual. **september 30, 2019** – ltfrb’s then-chief martin delgra said around 18,000 puv units nationwide, including 5,642 jeepneys, had complied with the modernization program. the government is looking to modernize around 170,000 units. he also said the transition phase of the program would end by june 2020. transport groups claimed a successful nationwide strike on the same day. acto’s de luna said nine out of 10 jeepneys in major cities participated in the protest action. delgra reportedly vowed they would proceed with the program. **march 2020** – the enhanced community quarantine (ecq) or a total lockdown was implemented in luzon because of the covid-19 pandemic, crippling the transport sector. **june 2020** – transport group federation of jeepney operators and drivers association of the philippines (fejodap) expressed concern the government would use the covid-19 pandemic as an excuse to phase out jeepneys, after modern jeepneys were prioritized over traditional jeepneys and uv express units to resume operations. in july, provisional authorities of puv operators were extended until dec. 31, 2020. **december 18, 2020** – the ltfrb extended the franchise consolidation deadline to march 31, 2021. **march 29, 2021** – the ltfrb extended the franchise consolidation deadline until the lifting of the ecq. in april, the board gave provisional authority to drivers and operators valid for a year. in december, it opened the application for operators plying routes that have yet to consolidate until march 2022. **march 25, 2022** – in a memorandum circular, the ltfrb said the provisional authorities for traditional jeepneys will be valid until march 2023, to give them time for franchise validation. in september, the board also extended the deadline for operators plying routes that have yet to consolidate. **february 21, 2023** – the ltfrb extended the deadline for the franchise consolidation until june 30, as ltfrb chief teofilo guadiz iii revealed only about 60% of traditional jeepneys had been modernized. **february 27, 2023** – manibela chairperson mar valbuena said around 100,000 drivers and operators would stage a week-long, nationwide strike on march 6 to pressure the ltfrb into suspending the mandatory consolidation. he reiterated calls that the program must be humane and reasonable, and for the vehicles to be locally made. **march 1, 2023** – president ferdinand marcos jr. urged drivers to cancel the strike but he stressed the need to implement the modernization program in a “different way.” it was the first time he shared his sentiments on the matter after winning the elections. during his campaign, marcos said the dotr should modernize puvs by inspecting the vehicles’ condition and not simply basing it on age. in the afternoon, the ltfrb announced the extension of the franchise consolidation deadline, now set until dec. 31, to give the transport sector “more time to consolidate.” but manibela’s valbuena said the strike would still push through. **march 2, 2023** – in a hearing, senators urged transport regulators to indefinitely postpone the deadline of the franchise consolidation. sen. poe noted that the national government itself is not yet ready to implement the puv modernization program. **march 6, 2023** – in anticipation of the possible effects of the transport strike, various cities and schools, mostly in metro manila, announced the shift to online and asynchronous classes. libreng sakay trips were also prepared. however, malacañang said many of the country's transport groups were not participating. **december 31, 2023** – this is the last day for drivers and operators to consolidate. **2024** – the second component of the puv modernization program will start. so sinong nagkulang? hindi totoong lahat ay pabor sa modernization, kagaya nung sinasabi nila. maraming jeepney drivers at operators ang ayaw talaga nito dahil hindi na nila magagawa yung mga kabalastugan na ginagawa nila noon. marami sa kanila ang may “pwede na yan, tumatakbo pa naman” mindset at ayaw mamuhunan dahil “nakasanayan” na. marami ding pasahero ayaw ng pagbabago dahil ayaw din nila gumastos o dahil kesyo kultura daw. adapt or die. we are in a capitalistic society whether we like or not, and jeepney like everything else is a transport business, “not a charity”. hindi kasalanan ng iba na humingi ng convenience, same way na hindi kasalanan ng mga tao kung bakit itong mga jeepney drivers na ito ay mawawalan ng trabaho kung sakaling matuloy man ang phase out. nilulugar dapat ang empathy at rules and regulation. hindi maaaring puro, pwede na lang. sa daan patunong progresong lipunan, masakit mang tanggapin, pero meron talagng collateral at masasagasaan. that’s how it is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/11komzv/a_hard_pill_to_swallow_pero_need_talaga/,7 03 2023
Tagalized Story.,"may story ako. ako lang ang nag-iisang babae sa pinag-tatrabahuhan kong kumpanya at alam ko na kung bakit. isa akong fresh graduate sa kolehiyo at gusto ko na talagang makapag-simula ng career agad-agad na walang kinalaman sa pagse-serve ng pagkain, pagpupunas ng mga gamit, o pag-dadala o timpla ng kape sa isang matandang negosyante. sa naka-sanayan nag-aapply ako sa trabaho na may anim na araw na trabaho at marami-rami na rin akong interview na napagdaanan. alam ko na ang tinapos kong hrm na kurso ay hindi gaanong makaka-kuha ng magandang oportunidad, pero naniniwala pa rin ako na may mas maganda pang trabaho na naghihintay sa akin. kaya naman nanatili akong positibo, matyaga, at nag-aapply lang sa mga office jobs na may magandang benipisyo. kahit halos wala na akong mapag-kunan ng makakain dahil sa magastos na mga interview, at least mapapag-tibay naman nito ang kakaunting pride na natitira sa akin. halos tatlong linggo na rin ang nakalipas, may isa akong phone interview sa isang internet security company. ang kumpanyang iyon ay maraming offices sa amin at naghahanap sila ng bagong customer support specialist para sa kanilang international department. ang mga requirements ay maganda o mahinahon na boses, good spoken and written grammar, kakaunting tech-knowledge, at may kakayahang mag-trabaho sa umaga at gabi. ang office ay dalawang sakay lang sa mula sa amin, at mayroon silang magandang offer sa health insurance. nag-aapply ako kahit lmitado lang din ang alam ko sa computer science. naging maayos naman ang phone interview at matapos ang dalawang meetings sa hr at sa management, binigyan nila ako ng isang napaka-gandang offer (kahit na wala pa talaga akong experience sa kahit anong trabaho). sa loob ng unang linggo ko, kailangan kong magtrabaho nang regular shift na 9-5 (am) para maging online ako kasabay ng manager ko, na nag-trabaho sa ibang branch ng kumpanya. pagkatapos noon ay kailangan kong magtrabaho para sa regular na schedule ko bilang support - ang schedule ko ay 6 na araw na pasok (09:00 am -05:00 pm (am) at may isang araw na night shift 09:00 pm - 05:00 am respectively). sa unang araw ko, ang suot ko ay isang loose na sweater at mahabang skirt. bilang sa kaalaman ko ay sa ganitong uri ng trabaho ay karamihan mga lalaki ang empleyado, ayaw ko naman mag-cause ng unnecessary attention dahil sa provocatively o inappropriately pag-susuot ng hindi naayon na attire. ang lalaki sa front desk ay mukha namang maayos na tao. pinakilala n'ya ang sarili n'ya bilang si andrew bago n'ya ako tulungang mag-fill out ng mga paperwork at sinamahan n'ya na ako sa aking mesa at sa isang open space na workspace. nakatitig lang ako sa tila walang katapusang mga desks habang naglalakad kami, napansin ko na halos hindi mo makikita ang mga mukha ng bawat taong nagta-trabaho na naka-upo sa bawat desks. wala man lang akong nakita o napansin na babae habang nag-lalakad kami sa tila baga'y walang katapusang workspace na iyon, na talaga namang hindi normal at nakaka-bahala. kahit ang kalmadong presensya ni andrew ay hindi kayang maiwaglit ang wari kakaibang pakiramdam na naka-tuon sa akin. halos maubusan ako ng hininga ng maramdaman ko ang mga presensya ng bagong kong co-workers na tila nagsasabi na ""hindi ka nababagay dito"". nagulat ako ng biglang huminto si andrew sa isang desk na napuno ng mga printed memes, floral stickers, at isang lumang keychain na naka-patong sa harap ng monitor. bukod pa doon ay natatakpan na rin ng makapal na alikabok ang keyboard, monitor at ang natitirang ispasyo ng desk. ""ahhh... anong nangyari..."" sabi ni andrew sa medyo upset na boses. ""pasensya ka na."" sabi nito habang nakatingin sa aking mga papeles. ""ah... aya. dapat matagal na 'tong nalinis. kailangan kong maka-usap ang custodian"". ""ok lang 'yun"", sagot ko. ""puwede ko namang punasan na lang 'yan, wala namang problema"". medyo asiwa na noon si andrew, pero habang ginagala ko ang aking paningin ay malinaw na wala ng ibang bakanteng desk maliban doon. mabilis na natapos ang araw na iyon. natutunan ko na ang mga dapat kung gawin na sumagot sa support related phone calls at gumawa ng bagong ticket para sa system. kailangan ko ring i-monitor ang lahat ng pumapasok na chats at written tickets at isaayos ito base sa level ng urgency at type nito. hindi naman ako required mag-bigay ng technical advice, pero dapat maging pamilyar ako sa aming product software. bilang wala pa namang mga tawag ay pinaki-alaman ko muna ang manual. halos wala akong maintindihan sa mga naroon kaya naman ginogle ko na lang ang karamihan na nasa manual. kinumusta ako noon ng manager ko at mukhang hindi s'ya masaya sa mga lapses ko sa mga materials. dahil pakiramdam ko wala akong matinong nagawa at gagawin sa mga oras na iyon ay panandalian akong nag-break para linisin ang mesa ko. tumayo ako para tanungin si andrew kung saan makaka-kuha ng basahan para sa mesa ko. agad-agad kong pinagsisihan ang desisyon kong iyon. ang bawat mata sa kwarto ay tila napako sa pagtayo ko sa aking kinauupuan. hindi ako sigurado pero maraming mga bulungan akong narinig habang papalayo ako sa aking mesa. ang kaninang maingay na mga keyboard ay pahina nang pahina na halos kainin na ako ng lupa sa sobrang hindi ko pagiging kumportable at self-conscious na rin at the same time. napansin ko na lang na halos halikan ko na ang dibdib ko sa pagyuko para lang hindi ako mapansin. bago ako maka-rating sa isang palikong daan patungo sa front desk ay buong-lakas kong tinignan ang isang tila walang hiyang lalaki na nakatitig sa akin. hindi ko alam kung ano ang inaasahan ko, pero 'yung overall appearance ng lalaking naka-hooding pang-asar na 'yun ay nagbigay ng matinding kilabot sa buong katawan ko. siguro mga ka-edad ko s'ya pero hindi man lang s'ya nahiya o natinag sa pagkaka-titig n'ya sa akin sa kabila ng pagtitig ko sa kanya na may halong pagka-bwisit at inis. isang kakila-kilabot na ngiti ang sumilaw sa mga labi nito habang naka-titig sa parteng bukong-bukong ng aking mga paa at dahan-dahan itong bumalik sa kanyang monitor. inisip ko kung anong magiging reaksyon n'ya kapag tinitigan ko rin ng kaparehong paraan ng pagtitig n'ya sa akin ang tinitigyawat n'yang leeg. parehong reaksyon pa rin ang nakuha ko habang naglalakad ako pabalik sa aking mesa kasama ang box ng computer wipes sa mga kamay ko. may maganda ring nangyari sa araw na iyon. habang nililinis ko ang mga drawer ng mesa ko ay may nakita akong half-used notebook mula sa nakaraang nagta-trabaho sa mesa ko. hindi n'ya nilagay ang first name n'ya, kundi initial lang at last name: j. espiritu. pero, base sa dekorasyon ng notebook, sigurado ako na babae rin s'ya kagaya ko. ang mga naiwan n'yang gamit ay nagbigay ng kapanatagan sa akin, pero 'yung notebook ang talagang pumukaw ng atensyon ko. doon ay sinabi nito ang pina-ikli at simpleng manual gamit ang easy-to-undertand terms at mga explenasyon sa nakaka-litong terminolohiya at komplikadong panuto sa manual. sa tulong n'ya ay nasurpresa ko ang aking manager sa aking product knowledge pagkatapos ng shift ko. matapos ang isang magandang araw ay buong tapang akong gumala sa office at nag-explore sa pantry. binenta ni andrew sa akin ang top-notch coffee machine at snacks sa nasabing pantry, tutal nagugutom na rin naman ako matapos ang isang emotionally, intellectually and productive na araw na 'yun. (ansabe). tsaka, medyo butas na rin 'yung bulsa at namumula na ang mga credit cards ko, kaya naman ayos na ako sa ilang pirasong masasarap na cookies. habang papalapit ako ay may narinig akong malakas na usapan at tawanan sa pantry. sa katangahan ko ay inisip ko na baka naman mas mainit, friendly o kahit maka-tao na sila sa akin. subalit ang maliit na pantry ay napuno ng katahimikan the moment na pumasok ako sa pantry. may limang lalaki doon na mag-kakaiba ang edad at lalaki na naka-upo sa palibot ng isang maliit na lamesa, at lahat sila ay naka-titig na direkta sa akin. ""panget na araw?"" - tugon ng isang pang-asar na boses. agad kong itinaas ang ulo ko mula sa pagkaka-titig sa sahig para hanapin ang pinag-mulan ng boses. hindi naging mahirap sa aking hanapin at malaman na mula iyon sa naka-hoodie na walang-hiyang tumitig sa akin nung nakaraan lang. ""siguro marami ka ng experience?"" - sambit pa nito sa nakaka-asar na tono at may-unting pag-taas ng kilay. ""para makakuha ng komportableng trabaho. siguro sikat ka?"". ""ano 'to, high-school?"" - sagot ko sa malakas na boses. hindi ko hilig kumompronta ng tao, pero sobra na 'to. hostility is one thing, social awkwardness is another, pero pakiramdam ko isa 'tong 80's na high-school drama na mga trenta anyos ang mga bida bilang mga teenagers. ""nandito lang ako para kumuha kape at kung may problema ka sa trabaho ko, puwede mong dalhin sa hr kung ano man ang issue mo"". nagpatuloy ako habang ine-enjoy ang namumutla at pahiyang mukha ng mga taong 'yun. mabuti naman, gusto kong maramdaman nila ang katiting na discomfort na buong araw kung kinakaharap. pinili kong lumayo sa aking mga co-workers, naglakad ako ng taas noo pabalik sa mesa ko na may hawak-hawak na tasa ng kape. bago pa ako maka-upo at enjoyin ang masarap na kape, napansin kong may isang mensahe galing sa hindi kilalang number: ""you have quite an attitude, don't you?"" nanigas ako habang hawak ang cell phone sa isa kong kamay at kape sa kabila. habang prino-proseso ko ang tila breach sa personal security ko, naka-tanggap ulit ako ng dalawa pang mensahe. isa ay ang hubo't-hubad kong katawan na sinend ko sa una kong serious college boyfriend. ang pangalawa: ""bakit hindi mo ngayon ibigay 'yang picture sa hr?"" sa totoo lang, sobrang naapektuhan ako sa invasion ng privacy ko. pumasok ang kahihiyan sa akin at sobrang naiinis ako for drawing so much unwanted attention sa sarili ko. kasalanan ko lahat 'to. pumasok ako sa isang office na puno ng ethical hackers na may pare-parehong pangalan ng aso bilang password. walang duda na ang litratong iyon ay umiikot na sa buong office at lahat ng iyon ay salamat sa walang hiyang ka-trabaho ko, at isa na akong kakatuwang tao sa loob ng office. hindi ko na ginalaw ang kape ko at umuwi na lang, habang pinipigilan ko ang bawat emosyon na bumuhos hanggang makarating ako sa safety ng bahay. halos hindi ako matigil sa kaiiyak nung gabing 'yun, iniisip ko na ang mga mukha ng mga ka-trabaho ko habang tigang na tigang na nakatitig sa hubad kong katawan. mga alas tres na ng madaling araw, doon ko lang na-realize na wala ng kwenta para pa magpaka-lunod ako sa kahihiyan. kailangan kong gumawa ng plano para maka-survive sa ganitong uri ng workplace. quitting is not an option kasi masyadong malaki ang pasweldo nila para tumigil ako. tsaka, halos tinapay na lang ang kaya kong bilhin sa araw-araw. ang pangalawa kong option ay pumunta sa hr, but there's no way i was going to open that can of worms. hindi ko mapapatunayan kong sino talaga ang nag-send ng mga mensahe na iyon. last option? stick with it, keep my head down, gawin ang trabaho na pinasukan ko at 'wag pansinin ang iba pang mga harassment na gagawin nila. 'yun nga ang ginawa ko. sa kabuuan ng isang linggong training ko ay pumapasok ako on time, hindi ako umaalis sa desk ko liban na lang kung pupunta sa palikuran. iniwasan ko rin ang kahit anong contact kanino man at pinanatili ko lang ang aking mga mata sa mga inanimate objects. salamat kay j. espiritu, palagi akong on top ng training ko. sa bawat bagong task na galing sa manager ko, laging may katumbas na entry sa kanyang notebook. wala ng nakaka-gagong texts at face-to-face na kumprontasyon, pero mayroong kakatuwang pakiramdam na panibagong sisira sa kalagayan ko. sa darating na biyernes na ang huling training ko, na nagdala sa akin sa huling entry sa notebook. night shift survival guide: - matulog sa buong umaga bago ang shift at 'wag na 'wag kang matutulog. - walang sino man ang dapat maka-pasok. - panatilihing may pepper spray na dala. (sa kahit anong sitwasyon). - i-check ang bawat aisle, meeting rooms. huwag kalimutang i-check ang ilalim ng lamesa, balkonahe, kitchen tables at kahit likod ng cooler. - laging mag-open ng skype na naka-ready sa emergency in case na hindi gumana ang mobile services. - panatilihing updated sa kaibigan/pamilya/lover kada oras. ang nasabing listahan ay medyo may kahulugan. una, sabi ng hr puwede naman akong matulog sa pagitan ng 2-5 am, basta malapit palagi sa akin ang office smartphone. mayroon nga silang pull out couch sa isang conference room para lang talaga sa ganitong sitwasyon. pangalawa, ang buong shift ay phone calls, kaya palaging may paraan para maka-tawag mula sa office phone, tama? lastly, ang mga naka-outlined sa ""guide"" ay parang o.a at paranoid. siguro 'yung listahan ay satirical? (ewan ko). siguro si espiritu parehas kami ng pakiramdam tungkol sa mga tila patay gutom na mga asong cold-blooded na co-workers? pero 'yung isip ko nag-tatrabaho ng sobra-sobra para makita ang logic sa likod ng mga pag-iingat na ito. may kakatuwa akong pakiramdam na may importanteng impormasyon akong hindi nalalaman. lahat 'yun iniisip ko habang paalis ako ng bahay nung biyernes na 'yun, last day ng training ko. ""andrew"", - dahan-dahan akong lumapit sa kanya. ""puwede ba mag-tanong?"" ""sure thing"", - sagot n'ya na may maaliwalas na ngiti sa kanyang mga labi. ""nagtataka lang ako, bakit wala akong nakikitang ibang support agents. i mean, 'di ba dapat merong at least lima pang tao para ma-cover 'yung six-day rotation cycle?"" ""kailangan mong tanungin ang manager mo tungkol d'yan. most likely naka-kalat sila sa iba pang branch sa syudad. normal lang naman 'yun sa ganoong kaso"", - sagot n'ya. pakiramdam ko tapos na kami sa diskusyon na 'yun matapos s'yang bumalik sa final tasks n'ya para sa linggong iyon. ""meron bang ibang agent na nag-trabaho dito liban sa akin?"" - pagpapatuloy ko, dahil ganun na lamang ang kagustuhan kong malaman ang iba pang detalye sa babaeng nag-fill out ng notebook na s'ya namang ginagamit ko sa buong linggong iyon. ""oo, may isang babae na humawak sa posisyon mo ng panandalian"", - ani ni andrew, habang naka-titig pa rin sa screen ng kanyang screen. pero napansin kong tumigil na s'ya sa pag-tatype o pag-galaw ng mouse. wari ko ay naka-titig lang s'ya sa iisang spot sa monitor n'ya. ""andrew"", - nag-salubong ang mga kilay ko. ""sino 'yung nag-trabaho malapit sa main working space na talagang nakaka-inis? maputla, medyo payat, maitim at kulot na buhok?"" - tanong ko, habang nagpapaikot ng daliri sa bandang ulunan ko para i-describe ang pagkaka-kulot ng nasabing lalake. ""ah... si michael"", - sagot nito, napansin nito ang pagiging iritable ng boses ko. ""may problema ba? ginugulo ka ba n'ya?"" ""hindi"" - sagot ko, pero sa isip-isip ko ay nagtatalo na ang emosyon at sarili ko. ""have a good weekend, andrew"" ""ikaw din"", - sagot nito, halata na may pagtataka sa boses nito habang papaalis ako. sa buong weekend na 'yun ay binabalik-balikan ko ang mga nangyari sa akin sa unang linggo ko. pakiramdam ko may hindi sinasabi si andrew sa akin na importante. wala namang rason para maging iretable s'ya nung nabanggit ko 'yung babaeng nag-trabaho bago ako. may nag-reklamo na kaya kay michael dati? pu-puwede kayang si j. espiritu? si michael ba ang dahilan ng survival guide sa notebook? bakit s'ya umalis? napaka-daming teorya ang bumagabag sa buong weekend ko. bago ko pa nalaman, oras na para bumalik sa trabaho. ito ang araw na talagang sobrang daming trabaho. kahapon ay lunes, ang unang regular day shift. mabilis lang dumaan ang nasabing araw, habang aligaga ako sa pag-sagot ng tawag, recording, sorting at assigning ng dose-dosenang customer complaints sa system namin. hindi sapat ang salitang nasanay na ako at pagkatapos ng araw na 'yun ay sobrang pagod at ubos na ako. saktong maglo-logout na ako, naka-tanggap na naman ako ng mensahe mula sa hindi kilalang number. ""ang sipag mo naman. hindi na ako makapag-hintay na mag night shift ka"" seryoso?! ito ang kauna-unahang mensahe na bumalot sa buong pagkatao ko ng takot. agad-agad kong ginala ang paningin ko kung nasa paligid ba si michael para kumprontahin ko s'ya sa pagse-send ng mensahe, pero kanina pa pala s'ya umalis. matapos kong pakalmahin ang sarili ko, umuwi na ako at sinusubukan kong hanapin si j. espiritu online. ang pinaka best bet ko noon ay sa linkedin, at doon nga ay sinusubukan kong galugarin ang buong listahan ng mga babae na may kinalaman sa proficient technologies na naka-lagay sa profile nila (halos kakaunti lang talaga sila). nung wala akong makita ay pumunta ako kay andrew at doon nga sa friend list n'ya ay sa wakas nakita ko na ang hinahanap ko. may babae na pangalan ay jennah espiritu at unemployed ang status. nag-send ako ng friend request na may mensahe na nag-papakilala at tinanong ko s'ya kung hinarass ba s'ya ng isa n'yang ka-trabaho. sa wakas, pakiramdam ko may patutunguhan na ako, natulog ako at inihanda ang sarili para sa bukas na event. naisip ko na baka may kakaibang mangyayari dahil sa pagbabago ng schedule nung natulog ako ng miyerkules. nag-check ako ng linkedin halos pagka-gising ko mga ala una. walang kahit anong sign kay jennah, kaya naman natulog ulit ako para makapag-handa sa night shift. medyo kinakabahan ako at excited at the same time kasi puwede ko ng mas malibot ang buong place of work ko intimately. dahil walang day crowd, malaya akong makaka-gala at ma-eenjoy ang cookies, dumura sa baso ni michael, kahit ano! may mga iilan pa ring mga nag-tatrabaho nung dumating ako para sa shift ko, pero hindi ko naman iyon pinansin at dahil sa nag-uumapaw na mga tawag at chats na aasikasuhin. makalipas ang dalawang oras, ang bugso ng mga tawag at chats pati mga tickets ay unti-unting bumagal hanggang tuluyan na nga itong tumigil ng sabay-sabay halos alas onse na ng gabi noon. sumandal ako sa kinauupuan ko at ginala-gala ang mga paningin sa aking workspace. wala ng tao noon sa office at least sa nakikita ko. naka-bukas ang lahat ng ilaw pero nung tinanggal ko ang headphones ko, may narinig akong mahinang jingling melody sa hindi kalayuan. para s'yang christmas carol, pero hirap akong tukuyin kong saan ito nangga-galing. wala namang dahilan para matakot ako sa pangyayari, pero pakiramdam ko ang mga nagtayuang balahibo sa mga kamay ko ay nagsilbing alarm. nang tumayo ako sa aking kinauupuan, nawala 'yung melody. well, naging paranoid na ako dati. minsan ko ng inisip na na may lalaking sumusunod sa akin isang gabi hanggang nilagpasan n'ya ako at nagtungo sa kalapit na tindahan sa 'di kalayuan. kahit mag-isa lang ako, lagi kong dino-double at triple check ang mga lock ng bahay bago matulog. aaminin ko na ang mga takot ko ay wala naman talagang basehan. mayroong naka-iwan ng headphones na konektado pa rin sa computer nito at naka-on ang music. o siguro may office party sa ibang kumpanya sa baba ng building. ang makarinig ng kanta ay nakaka-takot lamang sa mga kakatuwang horror movies, 'di ba? 'di ba?! para maka-siguro, hinalughog ko ang office para maka-siguro na mag-isa na nga lang ako. habang naglalakad sa gitna ng mga magkaka-dikit na desks, naisip ko kung gaano ako ka-swerte na mayroon akong sariling corner spot. hindi ko siguro kakayanin na mapalapit sa kahit sinong mga hindi kaaya-aya kong mga co-workers. matapos ko ma-check ang bawat rows ay dumiretcho ako sa front desk area at nagmamasid sa mga kagamitan ni andrew sa paghahanap ng clues. nung wala akong makitang clues ay bumalik ako sa main room ng pantry. unti-unti ng mas nagiging relaxed ang mga senses ko at tsaka ko lang napag-tanto na napasarap ata ang taste-testing ko sa mga cookies sa halip na mag-hanap ng mga kahina-hinalang mga bagay. kailangan ko ng tumigil sa kaka-kain ng cookies, pero dahil bumalik na naman ang kaninang tunog na naririnig ko, mas malakas s'ya ngayon. at the same time, ang work smartphone ko (na kinakailangan dala-dala namin kung aalis kami sa aming work station) tumunog at may mensahe mula sa hindi na namang kilalang number. so, nag-eenjoy ka ba sa cookies, ha? nanigas ang buong katawan ko habang prino-proseso ng utak ko ang mga pangyayari. siguro hindi talaga umalis ng office si michael at ngayon tinatakot ako. kinalikot ko ang tenga ko noon at nakinig ng maigi. walang kahit sino sa pantry as least sa nakikita at naririnig ko. tsaka, kung si michael ay nasa main workspace, hindi naman ganun kahirap na hulaan o sabihin na kumakain ako ng cookies. habang dahan-dahan akong humihinga, hindi ko muna pinansin ang tunog at nakinig ako ng maigi kung may iba pa akong tunog na maririnig. wala. dahan-dahan, naglakad ako sa may pantry drawers at doon may nakita akong malaking kutsilyo. alam ko bang gumamit ng kutsilyo? hindi. kaya ko kayang paalisin kung sino man ang unarmed na kalaban? syempre. papunta na sana ako pabalik sa aking work station ng biglang may tawag na pumasok mula sa work phone. ipinosisyon ko ang sarili ko ng kumportable sa pader ng pantry, kutsilyo sa kanang kamay, cell phone sa kabila, bago pa ako maka-sagot with the standard customer support greeting. nag static na sa kabilang linya at iba pang ingay sunod ang tuluyang pagka-putol ng linya at katahimikan. nung tinignan ko ang cell phone, nakita kong naka-patay na ito. sinubukan kong buksan ulit ito, pero hindi na ito gumagana. ok, ngayon kailangan ko ng bumalik sa computer ko in case na may pumasok pang mga tawag. naalala ko bigla ang isa sa mga guide na galing kay jennah habang isinusuksok ko ang walang kwentang cell phone sa bulsa ko. - laging mag-open ng skype na naka-ready sa emergency in case na hindi gumana ang mobile services. nangyari rin kaya 'to sa kanya? ang mga instructions sa notebook ay unti-unti ng nagkaroon ng kahulugan, at minumura ko ang sarili ko dahil sa pagiging tanga. sa oras na lumabas ang mga salita sa bibig ko ay may isa na namang mensahe ang dumating sa cell phone. kinuha ko iyon at sinubukang i-unlock, pero 'yung regular home screen ay hindi lumalabas. ang lumabas lang ay isang white screen na may maikling text. putang ina. ang mga babae dapat hindi ginagamit ng ganung mga uri ng salita. matapos kong mabasa 'yun ay nawala na ito sa screen at may panibagong text ang lumabas. bakit hindi ka lumabas at makipag-laro? huwag mo ng isiping bitbitin pa 'yang kutsilyong hawak mo. wala ring magagawa 'yan sa hawak kong baril. tinapon ko ang cell phone ko sa lapag at agad-agad ay nagtungo ako sa aking computer. ang tunog ay mas lalong lumakas habang papalapit ako sa aking lamesa, doon ay nakita kong may isang baboy na stuffed toy. may fabric button ito sa bandang paanan at music note na kasama. dito nagmumula ang tunog at nagpapatunay lamang na hindi ako mag-isa at may kung sino akong kasama. ang malala pa, pinapanood nila ang bawat galaw ko at sinusubukang takutin gamit ang mga laruang pambata. unti-unti ng dumadaloy ang pagpapanic sa aking buong katawan at naghahanda na sa fight or flight scenario. huminga ako ng malalim, sinusubukan kong pakalmahin ang buong katawan ko. so far wala pa naman akong naririnig ng kahit anong palatandaan na may ibang tao sa loob ng office. may mga background noises galing sa syudad sa labas at ang mga ingay mula sa naka-limutang patayin na computer ng isang employee. kung sino man ang gumagawa nito sa akin, kailangan kong malaman ang kanilang eksaktong lokasyon para maplano ko ng maayos ang pag-takas ko. isa pa, kailangan kong maka-kuha ng tulong sa lalong mas madaling panahon. habang iginigilid ko ang laruan ay umupo na ako sa aking upuan at pinull-up ang skype for business application. mabilis akong nag-dial ng 911, habang naka-loudspeaker ang telepono. tumunog na nga ang dial tone at agad-agad ay may live operator na sa kabilang linya. ibibigay ko na sana ang mga hindi kanais-nais na pangyayari sa akin ng mga oras na iyon ng may biglang humawak sa bukong-bukong ko mula sa ilalim ng lamesa. halos maubos ang buong lakas ko sa pagsigaw habang nagpu-pumiglas ang mga paa at mabilis na tumakbo sa abot ng aking makakaya sa bilis na hindi ko akaling kaya ko. may narinig akong kung anong kumusyon sa aking likuran habang tumakbo, kasunod ng isang malakas ng putok, na inisip ko na lamang na galing sa kung ano o sino man ang humahabol sa akin. bago ko pa malaman ay halos nasa ground floor na ako papunta sa pinto lagpas sa gwardiya na halatang nagulat sa mga nangyayari. ang malamig na hangin ay mabilis na pumasok sa manipis kong sweater habang papalapit ako sa isang malapit na pedestrian para humingi ng tulong. tumawag sila ng 911 at ang mga pulis ay agad namang dumating wala pang sampung minuto. habang naghihintay ako kasama ang gwardiya para sa kanilang pag-dating, hindi maalis sa isip ko ang sinulat ni jennah na warning, at kung gaano ako ka-tanga para ipagsa walang bahala ang mga ito. - i-check ang ang bawat aisle, meeting room. huwag kalimutang i-check ang ilalim ng lamesa, balkonahe, kitchen tables at kahit likod ng cooler. agad-agad namang sinulat ng pulis ang mga nangyari sa akin at iniwan ako kasama ang isang pulis officer, umakyat s'ya para i-check ang office. wala namang naka-labas-masok sa building mula nung tumakbo ako palabas, kaya malaki ang posibilidad na naroroon pa rin ang salarin at nagtatago sa loob. sa pag-iisip ay halos bumaliktad ang buong sikmura ko at mas lalo akong lumapit sa may armas kong kasama. maya-maya pa matapos kaming iwanan ng mga pulis, ang kasama kong pulis ay nag-radyo at isa-isa may mga boses na nagpapa-palit-palit sa radyo na humingi ng backup at nga mga codes na hindi ko maintindihan. mabilis na nag-escalate ang mga sumunod na pangyayari. imbis na pauwi ay dinala nila ako sa police station at doon ay nanatili ako sa isang interrogation room ng halos 2 oras bago pa sa wakas may dalawang pulis officer ang kumausap sa akin. pagod na ako noon, miserable ang kalagayan at higit sa lahat litong-lito sa kung papaano naganap ang mga pangyayari. gusto ko ng umuwi pero nanatili pa ako ng ilang oras para i-kuwento ang mga pangyayari sa dalawang pulis officer. 'ahh... meron kang kutsilyong hawak habang tumakbo ka galing sa pantry papunta sa lamesa mo? sigurado ka ba?' tanong ng isang nakaka-tandang officer na nagpakilala bilang senior investigator manlapig. 'ah. ah... oo.' pautal-utal kong sagot sa kanya. 'naniniwala akong meron. nag-papanic na ako noon, kaya mahirap sabihin. tapos may baboy na stuffed toy, ' sabi ko, habang tila baga'y nawawalan ako ng abilidad na mag-isip ng tama. 'at naniniwala ka na ang taong humaharass sa'yo ay si michael villareal?' sabi ng isa pang officer, hindi ko maalala 'yung pangalan n'ya. wala s'yang badge. 'hindi ko alam buong pangalan n'ya, pero wala na akong ibang kilala na iba pang responsable.' 'at sa huling pagkakataon, just for the record, anong nangyari matapos mong mag-dial ng 911?' tanong ni manlapig sa ika-apat na pagkakataon sa gabing 'yun. 'may kung sino ang humawak sa binti ko. bukong-bukong, actually. nangyari 'yun bago pa ako magkaroon ng pagkakataong ipaliwanag ang sitwasyon sa operator. nagsusumigaw at piglas ang mga paa ko tapos tumakbo hanggang may makita akong tao sa labas na pina-tawag ako sa 911 para sa tulong.' sagot ko, habang pagod na pagod sa paulit-ulit at paikot-ikot na pagtatanong. 'si michael villareal ay natagpuang patay sa hindi kalayuan ng iyong lamesa nung pumunta ang officer namin sa pinang-yarihan ng insidente. nakita mo ba ang kanyang katawan nung tumakbo ka palabas ng office?' tanong ng isang officer. halos malaglag ang panga ko sa mga narinig ko at tumitig sa dalawang pulis habang balisa at nanginginig sa takot. 'hi.. hi.. hindi,' pabulong akong nag-salita, 'hindi ko maintindihan,' 'sinaksak s'ya hanggang sa mamatay gamit ang malaking kutsilyo. ang katawan n'ya ay balot ng dalawampu't-tatlong saksak,' paliwanag ni manlapig. 'at nakita namin ang kutsilyo ay nakabaon sa bibig nito, dahilan para dumikit ito sa sahig diretcho sa lalamunan,' 'may rason kami para pagsuspetyahan na ito rin ang sinasabi mong kutsilyo,' dagdag pa ng pangalawang officer. nakatitig ako sa dalawang pulis officer ng tahimik, hirap akong intindihin ang mga pangyayari lalo na't ang utak ko ay halos mawala na sa ulirat. 'ang mga sinabi mo ay nagpapatunay lamang sa mga natagpuaan namin sa cell phone ni michael villareal. nalaman namin na may roon siyang hacking apps,' pagpapatuloy ng senior officer. 'natagpuan din naman ang ilan mo pang mga hubong larawan at ang mga mensahe na iyong nabanggit. mayroon s'yang baril at nakita rin naman ang basyo ng bala nung binaril ka n'ya habang papatakas ka.' 'ang hindi namin maintindihan ay kung papaano s'ya namatay.' dagdag pa ng pangalawang officer, halatang hindi s'ya naniniwala sa aking reaksyon. 'ok lang kung napatay mo s'ya dahil sa self-defense, aya. may balak s'yang masama sa'yo.' 'hindi,' pautal-utal kong sagot. 'pangako, wala akong ideya... oh, oh my god.' naiyak na ako dahil sa mga nangyayari. 'ibig kong sabihin, nung nakaraang buwan lang may nag-report sa kanya galing sa isa n'yang co-worker,' sabi ni manlapig. 'jennah,' bulong ko. 'kilala mo si miss espiritu?' tanong ng pangalawang officer, at ng suspetya sa kanyang mga mats. 'hindi,' ako ang pumalit sa lamesa n'ya at nakuha ko ang notebook n'ya. dapat sinabi ko na 'to kanina pa. anong sabi sa report? doon nga ay nagtitigan ang dalawang pulis at maka-lipas ang ilang sandali ay inilatag at ipinaliwanag ni manlapig ang mga hindi magandang nangyari kay jennah na halos mangyari na sa akin. si jennah espiritu ay dumiretcho sa pinaka-malapit na hospital mula sa kanyang unang night shift tatlong buwan na ang nakakaraan. sobrang bugbog ng katawan n'ya at sugatan, at gustong mag-file ng anonymous rape kit. ang natanong damage n'ya sa kanyang puwerta ay sobrang severe na kinailangan n'yang sumailalim sa operasyon at magpatahi. nag-file s'ya ng police report makalipas ang dalawang buwan matapos s'yang hindi pumasa sa probationary period sa inyong kumpanya, ng nawala s'ya sa trabaho (ang nagiisang paraan para mabayaran ang kanyang utang sa hospital). ang nangyari ay ang kanyang aligasyon kontra kay michael villareal, na gumastos s'ya ng malaki sama mo pa ang hindi mabilang na kanyang mga co-workers na kumontra sa kanya laban sa magalang at kaaya-ayang katangian ni michael. 'pero kahapon lang ay iniurong na n'ya lahat ng mga isinampa n'yang kaso kay michael,' sabi ng walang badge na pulis.

sincerely from me.* so i'm posting this update para sa mga redditors na nag follow kay nala especially sa mga nag donate. **may 22:** around 2 days after i posted a cry for help sa r/philippines nala isn't getting any better, kumakain pa din may gana pero hindi na ganun kalakas kagaya dati. but thursday night hindi siya kumain which is hindi naman nakakabahala, unfortunately morning to tanghali ayaw niya pa rin kumain so i tried carrying her and kinakausap ko siya but she's not responding. nabahala ako so tinry ko siya itayo para maglakad lakad pero bumabagsak lang siya ulit, nagpanic na ako so i called his original vet if he could help. i know it's a reach kasi ecq pa pero makakapunta daw siya hintayin ko daw siya sa bahay. when he arrived he told me to rush nala sa clinic nila (his original vet clinic) so nalaman ko nagbukas na pala sila around 2nd week of may. sinugod namin si nala sa furry friends sa caloocan and luckily siya lang ang patient non. they told me na grabe na yung damage sa skin niya and saw na baka may maggots yung paws na niya. they also told me that amputation is possible kapag unrepairable na or nabubulok na sugat niya especially sa paws at sa tail. masyado dinb daw manipis balat ni nala and napakadaming flakes na nagfafall off from her body kaya siya nangangati. &#x200b; [at furry friends clinic](https://preview.redd.it/saqrwsbx70251.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9443944503ec0cdd2041bd25de98691f5de3085b) i decided to skin scrape and cbc her. never pa siya na cbc, so ayun ang goal ko kasi hindi ko alam bakit hindi pa siya gumagaling since march. sa skin scrape nakita na meron siyang demodex (hindi ko po alam spelling) pero its an insect that causes itchyness and galis. she's positive for mange. the problem is usually marami na daw yung 1 to 2 na insect sa isang skin scrape pero sa kanya 12 (take note na hindi pa yun sa sugat kumuha) which indicates na sobrang abnormal na ng dami nung parasites. &#x200b; [shivers and cleaning ng sugat niya](https://preview.redd.it/eewwtclz70251.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=47d84285281125ed50cf12986e72905fba1b77b2) they told me this is caused by stress. dapat daw na cocontrol ng immune system niya yung pagdami nun kaso dahil na stress siya most probably because of the grooming kasi dun nagsimula siya mangati, sobrang dumami yung demodex. they even showed me what's on the microscope. nakakalungkot isipin na dahil lang sa simpleng grooming nagkaganyan na yung dating healthy na siya. cbc came out and they saw an abnormality sa mga components. may bacterial infection siya kaya bumababa ata ang hemoglobin niya hindi ko gaanong sure. while we were discussing, nala started to shiver and the doctor said na kinokombulsyon siya kasi 40 degrees yung temperature niya. &#x200b; [sorry nabura na yung cbc na naka attach, i also lost the computation how much it costs but naka php 3200 ako, she has around 6 na iniintake and a spray, plus the three injections.](https://preview.redd.it/z82q4n1380251.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9adfcdb1977fff2d30706a925e9023975745cb67) &#x200b; https://preview.redd.it/50ji08fa80251.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bea67e1d3f2a8d1a55a0fcf680fe2d1c326b73b0 they cleaned her sugat. and injected her three times. yung dalawa anti mange/anti parasite and yung isa for her fever. they told me na this will be a 6 week long na gamutan and babalik kami dun every friday starting 22. i agreed. they also told me to stop seeking for convenia because it'll be too costly and hindi sure na gagana, at least eto daw proven, they told me to make nala sa comfortable as possible to reduce her stress. bumalik na kami last friday and the doctors said na shes getting better albeit she lost .4 kg. pinalitan na din namin diet niya to reflex pero hindi niya gaanong kinakain. she's still weak, barely walking but nakakalakad na at least. the first 3 days din from 22 kamot siya ng kamot as in walang tigil kaya nakaka stress pero since monday she stopped itching na. nagtatanggalan na langib niya din. &#x200b; [her favorite spot on my chair](https://preview.redd.it/evaj95l190251.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=575df5eb0c79a5f0e8595cdfc248329bbbb63014) &#x200b; &#x200b; [latest pic, hindi na reddish skin niya and nagtatanggalan na scabs niya.](https://preview.redd.it/lpfmo7t390251.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4cbf0b6cdff492d9a6045c04268ec1345d1f9533) i**'m here to post this update to thank you guys for the support.** masakit man, pero kelangan ko kayo because some of my family members think na sayang lang ang pera sa kanya at ipamigay na lang daw namin tapos bumili na lang kami ng aso. i had arguments with my family because of this. maraming salamat po, she's recovering slowly pero hindi namin siya titigilan hanggang sa hindi siya gumagaling! **donations are still welcome, sobrang maappreciate namin yung donation because i barely have anything left.** 6 weeks na gamutan pa siya and every week may injection sa kanya. i hope na you guys are still willing to donate to an anonymous stranger and his dog. *if you are willing to donate please drop me a dm. pwede na din po bank kasi nakausap ko na gf ko and she lent me her bank account for donations.* ***please dm me for account # or gcash.*** &#x200b; thank you so much!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/gtqe7f/update_on_nala_my_maltichon/,31 05 2020
[NEED MEDICAL/LEGAL ADVICE] Doctor refused to sign my medical documents,"hi everyone! i don't know where else to ask this. or if this is a valid case to get a lawyer? can someone please enlighten me... 🙏 january 5 kasi, nagpasugod ako sa er ng isang private hospital dahil nag diarrhea ako with blood, and laging masakit tyan and joints ko then na admit ako from january 6-12. i have 3 different doctors. wala po akong pinili sakanila, sila lang ang nirefer ng health card ko sakin. and sa pagkatagal tagal kong nagstay dun, napagdecide nila na for ct scan ako. it happened january 11. yung 2 doctors, after lumabas ng results ng ct scan kinausap ako. (surgeon and rheumatologist) they agreed na bumuti na yung condition ko during my week-long stay. and base sa results ng ct scan, okay naman. no need for surgery, continue the medication nalang. pumayag na sila madischarge ako and mag followup nalang. so nagpa discharge na ko. however, nung kukuha na ko ng mga medical documents and fit to work, yung 1 doctor (gastro specialist) which is my main physician pa, gusto pa ng isang test dahil parang may nakikita daw syang bato sa gallbladder. i should do mrcp/ercp test pa daw. in her own firm words, ""never"" nya kong bibigyan ng fit to work and sign my medical documents. dahil need ko daw po muna gawin yung test na nirerequire nya, and for possible surgery daw po yung case ko. which is nag refuse na ko dahil... (1) inubos na nila laman ng health card ko (2) wala na rin akong cash pang test (3) i'm feeling better now (4) i think i have the ""right"" to decline because its my body? (5) no one even bothered to tell me how ct scan is done. i asked multiple nurses and parang ultrasound lang daw, ""uncomfy"" lang daw. claustrophobic po ako, at sobrang nginig at takot ko nung nandun na ko feeling ko mahihimatay na ko sa kaba. then i asked how is mrcp/ercp done, same as ct scan lang daw. 🙃 (6) i'm ready to die-- in fact, i'd rather die than do the test again. i asked her what are my other options. do the test lang daw. she wouldn't give me a fit to work dahil hindi nya daw po iririsk yung medical license nya giving ftw to someone na hindi naman talaga fit to work 🥴 kahit pumirma pa daw ako ng waiver. im not sure but i think mrsp cost around 20k+, kasi yung ct scan sakin is 25k already. i told her wala po talaga akong pera pang test, her answer is ""its not my problem anymore"". i asked help from my 2 other doctors at baka sila na pwede mag sign, no. si doc gastro daw kasi main physician ko so sakanya daw talaga dapat. help, i respect naman po her decisions pero tama po ba na kahit ayaw na ng patient, kahil alam na ng patient yung risk and ayaw talagang ituloy, need po ba talaga sumunod sa gusto ni doc magpatest and possible surgery? hindi po ako makabalik sa work ko kasi need yung documents. tinry na kausapin ng company doctor namin si gastro specialist, and same lang din sinasabi. i dont know much about medical and legal field. so i'd appreciate any help. asking for legal advice kasi baka this is something na pwede ilaban lol. kung hindi, edi wag. wag na tayo pastress. =========== tldr; kelangan ko ng signed medical documents para makabalik sa work, pero ayaw i-sign ng main doctor ko kasi hindi ko nasunod yung gusto nya na magpa-test pa. 💸 =========== thanks in advance. p.s. sabi ni doc bawal ako mastress at mapagod, pero bakit naman ganito sya mismo nagpapastress at papagod sakin magpabalik balik ng hospital 😵 & andami pa po nila kabalastugan for the whole duration of my stay (ex. they asked me to fast 48hrs for ct scan, yes 48) pero sobrang haba na para ichika ko pa lahat dito. gusto ko lang naman po bumalik na sa work...",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/kzvmoj/need_medicallegal_advice_doctor_refused_to_sign/,18 01 2021

What does Albularyo do (witch doctor/folk healer)? Do they really do something? May naniniwala pa ba sa kanila in this generation?,"so i have a brother, he's 25 year old. we rushed him twice in the hospital this week. pero prior pa sa mga episodes na'to, he's feeling symptoms already eg. tightness of chest, nagka-cramps ang katawan niya, difficulty sleeping, nahihirapan huminga, etc. after all the medical exams, okay naman lahat ng results niya, normal lahat ng test. a friend of his advised him to go to albularyo (which i am against kasi i think he's having mental health problems talaga which affects he's overall being since yung mga symptoms niya ay linked to anxiety and depression eg. panic attacks/difficulty breathing). but i just let them para sa peace of mind na rin na atleast we all did everything possible kahit na talagang kapos kami, we just don't want him to feel na pinapabayaan namin siya. so fastforward kung saan pumunta yung albularyo sa bahay, wala naman siyang masyadong ginawa. may sinabi na may lumalaro raw sa kapatid ko (nangkukulam daw sa kanya), mas marami pa actually yung pagboboast niya na he's done something for someone, na siya yung reason kung bakit nalaman kung sino yung kumuha sa wallet ng isa niyang pasyente (?). he's just engaging us in the conversation. he also said na yung mga ibibigay niyang papakuluan at iinumin ay exported pa raw and such. and to my surprise p4000 lahat yung siningil niya for that session only. he's not the typical albularyo rin, naka-car siya and mukha namang well-off. do you think reasonable yun as bayad? i mean, may mga naririnig naman na akong albularyo before pero usually hindi ganun kalaki ang hinihingi nila. since parang act of altruism yon in their part since meron silang god-given gift. i don't have anything against sa mga albularyo or naniniwala/nagpeperform nga mga ganoong rituals pero i felt robbed for me and sa kuya ko kasi we chipped in sa bayad. malaking bagay na yon para samin, he's living paycheck to paycheck and i'm still reviewing for my boards so big deal talaga yun sakin. and if ever may magtanong kung bakit hindi ko na lang sinuggest na magvisit ng psychologist. it is still not acknowledge sa amin, especially sa pamilya namin. and simply not accessible. (how can i put it into words) parang still stuck sa phase na ""nasa isip mo lang yan."" bottomline, are albularyos a thing? am i just overreacting sa bayad? edit: i'm reading all your comments guys and i really appreciate them. pero hindi ko lahat ma-process right now kasi my manung just talked to the albularyo, and he's asking him 5k kasi may ritual daw silang gagawin bukas and he's gonna bathe him with god knows what and how, at hindi pa sure kung yun na yung last na hihingin niya. and he assured him daw na 'pag 'di gumaling, ibabalik daw yung binayad. i really can't process anything right now kasi i'm thinking na baka this is only the beginning nung mga paghingi hingi niya, and knowing my brother he really won't listen to any of us. edit: please don't share this with any platform update: i took your advice guys and told him na he should instead see a therapist since malaking bagay yung hinihinging 5k. i also forwarded informative videos na very similar sa mga symptoms na nafifeel niya na linked to anxiety. unfortunately, umutang daw siya ng pambayad and binayaran na niya. and he won't acknowledge yung idea na maybe he has anxiety. sobrang close minded niya with regards doon. i'll just hope and pray for the placebo effect.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/17nhpid/what_does_albularyo_do_witch_doctorfolk_healer_do/,4 11 2023
Gusto ko lumayas ng bahay pero hahanap muna ako ng place where my aso will be taken care of hehe,"by take care: a house with a space where my dog (siberian husky) could run! he's never been caged nor left alone :^) i'll pay you for taking care of my precious dog. i'll shoulder the expenses of my dog's needs. just give him lots of hugs, scratches (and walking time i guess) and love! let me visit him as well. and if the time comes i get a house, please give him back to me. medyo demanding and ideal (for me) sorry but i'll pay (i hope 3k a month is enough for your care). so yeah, just want to know if anyone here knows a place (around diliman, qc or antipolo) who can shelter my dog for the meantime. maybe i'm just lost and desperate pero gusto ko na umalis sa bahay. here's the thing. ako ang panganay sa magkakapatid. my parents no longer work because of the pandemic. i, meanwhile, graduated the exact year this pandemic started. anyway, i earn measly. a far cry from what people assume my income would be as a graduate of the top university and with awards to boot. because of this, since the beginning of the year, paulit-ulit at buwan-buwan na lamang akong natatawag na walang kwenta at walang patutunguhan sa buhay. ako na nauubos ang sahod sa monthly expenses ng bahay at literal na walang pera pangsave for grad school ay walang kwenta. sa totoo lang, wala naman akong pake talaga na napupunta sa pamilya ko yung sahod ko, pero ibang usapan na kasi kung inggrato yung napaglalaanan? lam niyo yun. sukang-suka na ako dito. tuwing naririnig ko boses ng mga tao dito, nahihirapan ako huminga, tumutulo bigla ang mga luha ko. every month, may breakdown ako. gusto ko na lumayas. pero hindi pwede dahil may mahal akong aso dito. mahirap makahanap o minsan ay mahal pa ang mga lugar na pwede dog. slightly hindi option din yun kasi hindi sanay yung dog ko maiwan. baka magkasepanx haha. pwede din siguro if yung landowner ay dog lover, maybe they can look after my dog hmmm tldr: i badly need you guys to suggest a place/person/institution who can take care of my dog na parehas sa idea ko ng care please please",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/q5wz4t/gusto_ko_lumayas_ng_bahay_pero_hahanap_muna_ako/,11 10 2021

"alex, tanghaling tapat ng sabado, 2021","(any review for this is very-very much appreciated. i'm an aspiring writer po and i just launched a passion project anthology, isa po ito sa mga kwento) &#x200b; **chairman** ngayon ko lang naranasan ‘to sa tagal ko nang nanunungkulan sa barangay. isama mo na sa mga karanasang ‘yon ang lahat ng away mag-asawa, suntukan ng mga lasing, at mga batang ginagahasa sa bukiran. pero eto… ngayon ko lang napansin na buong araw ko na palang hinihimas ang rosaryong nakasabit sa leeg ko. maya’t-maya ko pa hinahalikan at binubulungan na sana’y wag mangyari sa pamilya ko ang nakita ko kanina. naririnig ko pa rin ang sigaw ni cecil, kumare’t-kapitbahay namin, tanghaling tapat ng sabado, kung saan ang tanghalian sa buong kalsada nami’y naantala dahil sa kanyang nakakakilabot na sigaw. sa ilalim ng nagbabagang init ay nagsitakbuhan kami upang sumaklolo. kinailangan ko pang iwanan ang tinola ni misis at ang isang basong softdrinks na nilalanguyan pa dalawang yelo nang ako’y tumakbo papunta sa bahay ni cecil. ngayo’y hindi pa rin ako kumakain. sa totoo nga’y hindi pa ako nakakaranas ng gutom. hindi ko pa ata kaya. sa bahay ni cecil ay dinatnan namin ang katawan ng panganay ni cecil na si joe na nakaratay sa braso ng kanyang bunsong kapatid na si alex, sa sahig ng kanilang sala. sa leeg ni joe ay nakabaon ang basag na bote na ginamit ni alex na balot na balot sa dugo ng kanyang kapatid. agad ang kapit at halik ko sa aking rosaryo nang makita ko ang imahe; na parang sinaunang obra na naglalahad ng malagim na kwento. pero ano ang kwento neto? hanggang ngayon ay wala pa rin kaming ideya kung bakit. magmula sa pagsigaw ni cecil ng, “anong nangyari?! anak, anong nangyari?!” sa tulalang alex na nakatitig sa dilat na mga mata ni joe, hanggang sa pagpunta namin dito sa aking opisina sa barangay, ay wala pa rin kaming makuhang rason mula sa bakit. sa isang maliit na kwarto sa aking opisina’y pinaupo ko muna si alex. tulala at sinusubukang burahin ang dugo sa kanyang mukha gamit ang duguan ring damit n’ya. hinainan ko ng isang bote ng softdrinks at tatlong pandesal mula pa sa agahan namin kanina si alex, na agad namang n’yang kinain ng walang pag-aalinlangan. dito na nagsimulang gumapang ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod. isang kilabot na hindi ko maipaliwanag, habang pinapanood ko si alex na walang awat sa pagkain, habang ako’y hindi ko pa rin magawang matakam sa masarap na lutong nag-aabang sa’kin sa bahay. “alex,” marahan kong sinabi. “ba’t mo ginawa ‘yun?” tumingin lamang sa’kin si alex, patay na mga mata, bibig na mabagal ang nguya. at sa kanyang paglunok ay walang mga salitang bumalik sa’kin. hindi ko alam kung bakit pero bigla kong naalala si jefferson, isang tricycle driver dito sa’min. dalawang taon na ang nakakalipas nang mapatay n’ya ang isang dayo na nakaaway n’ya sa kalsada. nangyari ‘to nang kamuntikan n’yang makasalpukan ang sasakyan ng dayo, at nang nahinto silang dalawa’y nagkasagutan muna sila bago mapikon si jefferson. hinampas n’ya ng bakal na tubo ang dayo. hindi na raw n’ya napigilan dahil sa mga mapanglait na mga salitang tinawag sa kanya. bobo, unggoy, uling, mababa. labing-isang beses paulit-ulit na hinampas ni jefferson sa ulo ang dayo, at sa sobrang lakas ng bawat hampas ay may parte na ng utak na lumabas dito. sa prisinto’y naalala ko si jefferson, iyak nang iyak at humihingi ng tawad dahil sa nangyari. hindi makakain, hindi rin makatulog. nilamon na s’ya ng konsensya n’ya, at ang konsensya n’ya ang tumulak sa kanya na agawin ang baril ng isa sa mga pulis na nagbabantay, at iputok sa kanyang sariling ulo. nasaktan si jefferson, nagalit, at di nakapagpigil. naintindihan ko ang kwento ‘nun. pero bakit hindi ko maintindihan ‘to? alam kong magkasundo ang magkapatid na ‘to. alam ko kung ga’no sila kalapit sa isa’t-isa. kaya pa’no nangyari ‘to? ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod ay gumagapang paakyat hanggang sa aking dibdib, tila ba kumakapit ng mahigpit. pasikip nang pasikip at medyo nahihirapan akong huminga. ang kakaibang pakiramdam na ‘to’y tumitindi habang nanatiling tahimik at nakatitig lamang sa’kin si alex. biglang iniabot ni alex ang kanyang kamay at dito tumalon na ang puso ko. napaatras ako sa aking kinauupuan, at mabilisan kong hinugot ang aking rosaryo mula sa pagkakatago nito sa aking damit. itinutok ko ito kay alex, na walang ibang kibo kun’di ang kunin ang bote ng softdrinks na nasa harapan n’ya. mas bumilis pa ang pagkatok sa aking dibdib, na para bang kamuntikan na kong mamatay. habang si alex nama’y pinapanood lang ako habang patuloy ang kanyang pag-inom. wala nga ata talagang mangyayari, at nang maramdaman ko kung gaano katahimik ang kwarto’y kumalma na ako. bakit sa dulo ng utak ko’y hinihiling ko na may sapi o di kaya’y isang demonyo talaga ang kaharap ko, at sa presensya ng aking rosaryo’y masasaktan s’ya. kahit anong kakaiba. kahit ano basta magkaroon lang ng eksplenasyon ang nangyari. pero siguro’y kakaiba na rin ang ikinikilos ng bata. at siguro nga’y mas dapat talaga akong matakot sa buhay kaysa sa patay. **cecil** “saan ba ko nagkulang?” tanong ni aling cecil sa mga kumare n’yang nakapalibot sa kanya sa masikip na opisina ni chairmain. napapaligiran din s’ya ng makukulay na mga pamaypay na hindi sabay-sabay ang pagaspas sa harap n’ya; nilulunod si aling cecil sa hangin. ang kanyang mukha nama’y tila ba isang rebulto ng santo kung punas-punasan ng mga panyo. “hindi ko pa rin maintindihan,” dugtong n’ya. “hindi naman ako nagkulang sa aruga. pareho ko namang pinapakita sa kanila na pantay ang pagmamahal ko sa kanila.” tuyo na ang mga mata ni aling cecil, ngunit tila ba hindi pa rin tapos ang kanyang pag-iyak. “hindi sila nag-aaway. hindi ko man lang narinig na nagtalo silang dalawa. o kung may pagtatalo man, malamang sa malamang maliit na bagay lang ‘yun. hindi yung ikakamatay mo!” isang labi ng lumapit sa tenga ni aling cecil, “alam mo tingin ko, baka inggit ‘yan. kasi si joe lang may trabaho sa kanilang dalawa, di ba? tapos si alex, wala pa rin sa kolehiyo. nag-aaral pa rin. sigurado akong ‘yun ang dahilan.” isa pang labi ang lumapit sa kabilang tenga naman ni aling cecil, “baka napikon na. kasi di ba halos s’ya na sa lahat ng gawaing bahay? baka pakiramdam n’ya porke’t mas malaki ambag ng kapatid n’ya , alila na s’ya neto.” isang labi naman na kaharap ni aling cecil ang nagsabing, “baka nagbabait-baitan lang kasi nga si joe ang halos sumasalo sa mga bayarin, pati sa pag-aaral n’ya. pero galit talaga s’ya, kasi baka naman may pagkakataong mas nabibigyang-atensyon si joe kahit hindi n’yo napapansin. kasi halimbawa uuwi s’yang pagod galing sa trabaho, syempre di n’yo maiwasang alagaan, pagsilbihan.” sa gitna ng mga labing ito’y si aling cecil, at ang ideyang unti-unting nabubuo dahil sa mga sinasabi ng mga labi sa kanya. “siguro,” sabi n’ya. “siguro nga.” **abbie** ang pangalan n’ya’y abbie. social worker daw s’ya. pagpasok n’ya’y agad bumungad sa’kin ang asul na bra sa ilalim ng dilaw na blouse nang tapatan ito ng liwanag mula sa bintanang katabi ko. sa kanyang pagtali ng buhok ay nakita kong basang-basa na ang kanyang kili-kili at kumikinang na sa pawis ang kanyang leeg. “alex?” sabi n’ya habang maya’t-mayang tinutulak ng kanyang daliri ang salamin n’yang dumudulas sa kanyang matangos na ilong. “bakit di mo ikwento muna sa’kin ang nangyari bago tayo umalis dito?” pasensya ka na, abbie. hindi ko nagawang sabihin kay chairman, na kilala pa mandin namin. hinding-hindi ko rin masasabi sa’yo. walang ibang maglalahad ng nangyari kun’di ang mga taong nais magbigay kahulugan dito, kasi kung ako tatanungin kung bakit, sa totoo lang, hindi ko rin alam ang isasagot. may nabasag akong bote sa kusina kanina, at sa pagpulot ko nito’y pumasok sa isip ko ang isang udyok. yung tipo ng udyok kapag nasa mataas kang lugar, at bigla mo na lang gustong itulak ang kasama mo. pero alam mong hindi ito dapat gawin, at kakapit ka pa nang mas mahigpit sa kanila para masiguro mong hindi ito mangyayari. ang udyok na ito’y nagsabi sa’kin na isaksak ko kay kuya ang basag na bote. at nalaman ko na lang na totoo na pala ang lahat nang dumapo sa aking balat ang mainit na dugo ni kuya. nahinto lang ako nang maramdaman ko ang buto sa leeg n’ya at nang marinig kong nabibilaukan na s’ya sa kanyang sariling dugo. hindi ko pa rin alam kung bakit. sana, tulad ng iniisip ni chairman, ay nasapian na nga lang ako. pero nakita ko ang lahat, andun ako. hindi ko lang alam na totoo pala ang lahat. namatay si kuya joe sa wala. at hindi ko matanggap na wala. normal lang sana ang sabado namin. tahimik. nanonood lang si kuya ng tv, naglilinis ako sa kusina. si nanay nama’y namamalengke ng pananghalian namin. bicol express daw ang lulutuin n’ya. puta, sinira ko ang araw. gusto kong umiyak dahil hindi na kami babalik sa salo-salo namin. “alex?” muling tawag ni abbie. “gusto kong malaman kung bakit. tayong dalawa lang. kaibigan mo ko dito. hinding-hindi ko ‘to sasabihin sa nanay mo, sa mga kapitbahay n’yo. may mga naririnig ako sa labas na dahil daw sa inggit? totoo ba ‘to? sa inggit nga? magmula nang dinala ako ni chairman dito sa maliit na kwartong ito’y napagpasyahan kong manahimik na lang sa nangyari. sa ngayo’y nilalabanan ko ang mga luha, nilalabanan ko ang panginginig ng aking bibig, at ang mga salitang gustong lumabas mula sa’kin. dapat mukhang hindi ko pinagsisisihan. dapat mukha akong galit. para naman mabigyang halaga, mabigyan ng ibig-sabihin ang pagkamatay ni kuya joe. dapat tinatatak ko sa utak ko na dapat lang! dapat lang sa kanya ang nangyari. dapat hindi ako bibigay. dahil kapag natalo ako, mamatay talaga sa wala si kuya. “sige, kung ayaw mong magkwento, ako muna. kasi naalala ko ‘tong isang batang babae at ang tatay n’yang abusado. tatay n’yang lasinggero. tatay n’yang isang beses s’yang hinipuan sa kanyang sariling kwarto at pinilit. ampon ang batang ‘yon, at tatay-tatayan n’ya lang etong umaabuso sa kanya. takot na takot ang bata dahil pakiramdam n’ya isang gabi’y papatayin na lang s’ya bigla neto. kaya naman isang gabi, nang bigla s’yang pinuntahan ng kanyang tatay upang pagsamantalahan ulit, sinasaksak ito ng bata gamit ang lapis sa mata, sa leeg, at sa dibdib.” kumuha ng panyo si abbie. sa kanyang paggalaw ay muling sumisilip ang kanyang bra sa likod ng blouse na parang mga batang naglalaro sa likod ng kurtina. “masarap sa pakiramdam, pero pumapatay pa rin s’ya ng tao. ilan taon n’yang dinibdib ‘yun. hanggang ngayon nararamdaman pa rin n’ya ang mga kamay ng tatay n’ya sa kanyang ari. sa kanyang dibdib. ilang taon bago n’ya matanggap ang ginawa n’ya. ngayon, medyo mahirap pa ring ikwento, pero kahit papaano’y kaya ko na. nangyari na kasi.” para bang may sumuntok sa aking dibdib nang marinig ko ‘to. bigla kong tinanggal ang aking paningin sa kanyang bra, at sa paggalaw ng aking mga mata’y bigla kong naramdaman ang pamumuo ng mga luha. “ayos lang, alex. pero andito lang ako. aalagaan ka muna namin. tapos pag handa ka na, makikinig ako. kahit pakonte-konte pa, ayos lang. aantayin kong mabuo ang kwento mo.” bumibilis bigla ang tibok ng puso ko. lalong nanginginig ang aking labi. at biglang pumasok si kuya sa isip ko, tumatakbo papalayo sa akin. mga bata pa kami, at hinahabol ko s’ya. “alex?” kuya wag kang lumayo! “alex?” kuya dito ka lang! kailangan kita dito! “sige, ayusin na natin pag-alis mo.” at parang isang batang nadapa sa semento, dito na walang awat na tumulo ang luha sa aking mga mata. “alex?” “hindi ko rin alam… hindi… ko rin alam. sorry, kuya! sorry! hindi ko rin alam kung bakit! patayin n’yo na lang ako! hindi ko alam anong nangyari! hindi ko na kaya!” lumalabo na ang aking paningin, pero kahit ga’no kalabo ang aking mga mata’y kitang-kita ko ang gulat at takot sa mukha ni abbie. pasensya ka na, kuya.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/nlygsa/alex_tanghaling_tapat_ng_sabado_2021/,27 05 2021
I hope Leni's administration brings back competent people in the govt,"i work in the development sector. i've worked with international donor funded projects before like us ones and all i can say is... maraming magaling sa pilipinas. wala nga lang sa gobyerno. my previous managers and coworkers are freaking geniuses in their craft and work. ang gagaling. tipong going above and beyond and ang scary ng competence nila. they all used to work in the government too but left for the private sector kasi sobrang taken advantage sila sa govt. sobrang panget ng kalakalan sa govt. one thing i noticed about leni and her office is that they move like an international ngo. biro naming tropa is mabagal govt and employees kasi di naman nauubos pera nyan. walang deadlines. sa devt sector 5 years, 6 years, etc lang ang project mo so may hinahabol kang oras. need mo talaga ng accountability sa pera mo din. lahat dapat may means of verification (movs). lahat may reports and documentation. dapat tugma ang reports at movs. ang trip mo may 1, natapos ka ng may 3, dapat by may 6 at most submitted na report mo. sobrang galing and bilis ng process sa maraming internationally funded projects kasi doon napunta ang mga leaders natin. marami sa kanila galing sa govt na nagsawa sa pamamalakad at sistema i hope if, no, when leni wins mahikayat nya muli silang bumalik. marami tayong competent leaders and development workers guys. sadyang wala lang sila sa gobyerno",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ufdz3g/i_hope_lenis_administration_brings_back_competent/,30 04 2022
Our daily dose of hopium: silent Leni supporters,"may event sa family kung saan may ilang hindi nakadalo. dahil dun sa mga absent na yon, nagkaroon ako ng opportunity makausap nang totohanan yung pinsan kong lalake kung sino talaga iboboto niya. before this, dalawang beses na ako nag-attempt na ikampanya si leni sa mga family members na madalas ko makainuman. both times, either tahimik lang si pinsan or pabiro ang mga sagot (like si rastaman daw iboboto niya). kanina nung kausap ko siya, pabulong niya inamin na ""silent"" daw siya. silent ano? silent bbm? nope. silent leni. ang pinsan kong to, gym rat. malaki ang katawan, yung tipong magdadalawang isip ka bago mo banggain. friendly din siya at magaling makipag-koneksyon. madami siya kaibigan na mga pulis. sabi rin niya, yung mga kaibigan niyang pulis na yon, leni supporters din. aminin ko guys, nabuhayan talaga ako ng loob. sabi niya kasi ayaw lang talaga niya mapaaway dahil sa choice niya, siguro dahil na rin ayaw niya makwestyon yung pride niya bilang maton na lalaki na boboto sa babae. pero aware siya sa mga kakulangan ni babym para magpatakbo ng bansa. binanggit pa nga niya yung smni debate na nagpasaring si clarita carlos dun sa mga hindi umattend ng debate nila. (please help me cite this kasi di ako nanood non.) parang nakalimutan nila na si marcos jr. ang numero unong duwag pagdating sa pakikipag-debate. one last thing na sagot ni insan nung sinabi ko na kaya tayo dapat nanghihikayat pa kasi yung survey gap ang hinahabol, mauulit daw ulit yung nangyari six years ago during the vice presidential election. i do think baseless yung confidence niya na ganun nga ang mangyayari kahit wala tayong ibang gawin, but the thought is at least heartening. p.s. kasama namin sa usapan yung isa ko pang pinsan na undecided daw pero lbm ang asawa. hopefully napaisip man lang namin siya kung hindi outright nakumbinsi mag-leni then and there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/tycnjb/our_daily_dose_of_hopium_silent_leni_supporters/,7 04 2022
Story time: Uninformed News Edition,"a friend showed me a tiktok video of a supposed influencer sharing his thoughts on covid. the video (with embedded texts) went like this: ""storytime: covid 19 edition and then dinala sa hospital, dead on arrival. then sabi nung doctor sa mga kamag anak. kung papayag yung family na ang ilagay sa death cert nung namatay ay covid instead of heart attack 😱😱. so yun lang, idk what to do with that information kaya skl."" let me answer you, what you should do with that information is ask someone who is knowledgeable on the topic or at least someone who knows more than you do, cause you definitely don't know a lot. what you should not do though is post a video putting the hospital and medical professionals in a malicious light. for those of you who wants to be educated on the topic: anyone who is symptomatic, we can't mix with those who do not have the symptoms. ubo, sipon, lagnat, hirap sa paghinga, pananakit ng kasukasuan, pagsusuka, pagtatae or pagkawala ng pang-amoy at panlasa. you might be wondering, eh ang daming sakit with the same symptoms. yes, kaya nga po puno ang emergency rooms and covid floors. unless proven na negative ka sa covid (with rt-pcr), it is prudent that we don't place you with those without the symptoms. hospital protocols also dictates that anyone who arrives dead will be tagged as covid suspect (relating to the tiktok vid, paano nasabing heart attack? may ckmb ka? may trop i ka? may ecg ka ba???). covid also complicates underlying conditions like heart, brain problems which might have led to the demise of the patient. did the patient die of a heart problem? possible. did the patient die of covid? possible. hindi sya exclusive, and unless we do post-mortem swab, we will not know. the government ideally should fund more research centers and laboratories, to make testing more available kahit sa maralita. sayang yung mga inutang. hindi lahat ng tao afford ang 2-5k na rt-pcr swab na may 7 days validity lang. pag may rt-pcr ka na timely ang collection, you need not be tagged as suspect and can be treated sa covid negative area, therefore decongesting the covid suspect area, therefore freeing some resources that can be used for those in critical conditions. i am all for freedom of expression, but i also believe in responsible posting. supposed ~influencers~ should help us eradicate misinformation, use their platform for greater good. you also address your audience well. isang taon na tayong lockdown, ang dami nang dinagdag na letra sa cq. baka naman po? if you have any questions, if in any way i can explain things in simpler terms. i also urge people in the medical field to answer people the simplest way possible, to be ""patola"" na. our job extends way outside the corners of the hospital. di na lang covid ang kalaban, bad governance, ignorance and misinformation too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/mgihgq/story_time_uninformed_news_edition/,30 03 2021

"alex, tanghaling tapat ng sabado, 2021","(any review for this is very-very much appreciated. i'm an aspiring writer po and i just launched a passion project anthology, isa po ito sa mga kwento) &#x200b; **chairman** ngayon ko lang naranasan ‘to sa tagal ko nang nanunungkulan sa barangay. isama mo na sa mga karanasang ‘yon ang lahat ng away mag-asawa, suntukan ng mga lasing, at mga batang ginagahasa sa bukiran. pero eto… ngayon ko lang napansin na buong araw ko na palang hinihimas ang rosaryong nakasabit sa leeg ko. maya’t-maya ko pa hinahalikan at binubulungan na sana’y wag mangyari sa pamilya ko ang nakita ko kanina. naririnig ko pa rin ang sigaw ni cecil, kumare’t-kapitbahay namin, tanghaling tapat ng sabado, kung saan ang tanghalian sa buong kalsada nami’y naantala dahil sa kanyang nakakakilabot na sigaw. sa ilalim ng nagbabagang init ay nagsitakbuhan kami upang sumaklolo. kinailangan ko pang iwanan ang tinola ni misis at ang isang basong softdrinks na nilalanguyan pa dalawang yelo nang ako’y tumakbo papunta sa bahay ni cecil. ngayo’y hindi pa rin ako kumakain. sa totoo nga’y hindi pa ako nakakaranas ng gutom. hindi ko pa ata kaya. sa bahay ni cecil ay dinatnan namin ang katawan ng panganay ni cecil na si joe na nakaratay sa braso ng kanyang bunsong kapatid na si alex, sa sahig ng kanilang sala. sa leeg ni joe ay nakabaon ang basag na bote na ginamit ni alex na balot na balot sa dugo ng kanyang kapatid. agad ang kapit at halik ko sa aking rosaryo nang makita ko ang imahe; na parang sinaunang obra na naglalahad ng malagim na kwento. pero ano ang kwento neto? hanggang ngayon ay wala pa rin kaming ideya kung bakit. magmula sa pagsigaw ni cecil ng, “anong nangyari?! anak, anong nangyari?!” sa tulalang alex na nakatitig sa dilat na mga mata ni joe, hanggang sa pagpunta namin dito sa aking opisina sa barangay, ay wala pa rin kaming makuhang rason mula sa bakit. sa isang maliit na kwarto sa aking opisina’y pinaupo ko muna si alex. tulala at sinusubukang burahin ang dugo sa kanyang mukha gamit ang duguan ring damit n’ya. hinainan ko ng isang bote ng softdrinks at tatlong pandesal mula pa sa agahan namin kanina si alex, na agad namang n’yang kinain ng walang pag-aalinlangan. dito na nagsimulang gumapang ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod. isang kilabot na hindi ko maipaliwanag, habang pinapanood ko si alex na walang awat sa pagkain, habang ako’y hindi ko pa rin magawang matakam sa masarap na lutong nag-aabang sa’kin sa bahay. “alex,” marahan kong sinabi. “ba’t mo ginawa ‘yun?” tumingin lamang sa’kin si alex, patay na mga mata, bibig na mabagal ang nguya. at sa kanyang paglunok ay walang mga salitang bumalik sa’kin. hindi ko alam kung bakit pero bigla kong naalala si jefferson, isang tricycle driver dito sa’min. dalawang taon na ang nakakalipas nang mapatay n’ya ang isang dayo na nakaaway n’ya sa kalsada. nangyari ‘to nang kamuntikan n’yang makasalpukan ang sasakyan ng dayo, at nang nahinto silang dalawa’y nagkasagutan muna sila bago mapikon si jefferson. hinampas n’ya ng bakal na tubo ang dayo. hindi na raw n’ya napigilan dahil sa mga mapanglait na mga salitang tinawag sa kanya. bobo, unggoy, uling, mababa. labing-isang beses paulit-ulit na hinampas ni jefferson sa ulo ang dayo, at sa sobrang lakas ng bawat hampas ay may parte na ng utak na lumabas dito. sa prisinto’y naalala ko si jefferson, iyak nang iyak at humihingi ng tawad dahil sa nangyari. hindi makakain, hindi rin makatulog. nilamon na s’ya ng konsensya n’ya, at ang konsensya n’ya ang tumulak sa kanya na agawin ang baril ng isa sa mga pulis na nagbabantay, at iputok sa kanyang sariling ulo. nasaktan si jefferson, nagalit, at di nakapagpigil. naintindihan ko ang kwento ‘nun. pero bakit hindi ko maintindihan ‘to? alam kong magkasundo ang magkapatid na ‘to. alam ko kung ga’no sila kalapit sa isa’t-isa. kaya pa’no nangyari ‘to? ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod ay gumagapang paakyat hanggang sa aking dibdib, tila ba kumakapit ng mahigpit. pasikip nang pasikip at medyo nahihirapan akong huminga. ang kakaibang pakiramdam na ‘to’y tumitindi habang nanatiling tahimik at nakatitig lamang sa’kin si alex. biglang iniabot ni alex ang kanyang kamay at dito tumalon na ang puso ko. napaatras ako sa aking kinauupuan, at mabilisan kong hinugot ang aking rosaryo mula sa pagkakatago nito sa aking damit. itinutok ko ito kay alex, na walang ibang kibo kun’di ang kunin ang bote ng softdrinks na nasa harapan n’ya. mas bumilis pa ang pagkatok sa aking dibdib, na para bang kamuntikan na kong mamatay. habang si alex nama’y pinapanood lang ako habang patuloy ang kanyang pag-inom. wala nga ata talagang mangyayari, at nang maramdaman ko kung gaano katahimik ang kwarto’y kumalma na ako. bakit sa dulo ng utak ko’y hinihiling ko na may sapi o di kaya’y isang demonyo talaga ang kaharap ko, at sa presensya ng aking rosaryo’y masasaktan s’ya. kahit anong kakaiba. kahit ano basta magkaroon lang ng eksplenasyon ang nangyari. pero siguro’y kakaiba na rin ang ikinikilos ng bata. at siguro nga’y mas dapat talaga akong matakot sa buhay kaysa sa patay. **cecil** “saan ba ko nagkulang?” tanong ni aling cecil sa mga kumare n’yang nakapalibot sa kanya sa masikip na opisina ni chairmain. napapaligiran din s’ya ng makukulay na mga pamaypay na hindi sabay-sabay ang pagaspas sa harap n’ya; nilulunod si aling cecil sa hangin. ang kanyang mukha nama’y tila ba isang rebulto ng santo kung punas-punasan ng mga panyo. “hindi ko pa rin maintindihan,” dugtong n’ya. “hindi naman ako nagkulang sa aruga. pareho ko namang pinapakita sa kanila na pantay ang pagmamahal ko sa kanila.” tuyo na ang mga mata ni aling cecil, ngunit tila ba hindi pa rin tapos ang kanyang pag-iyak. “hindi sila nag-aaway. hindi ko man lang narinig na nagtalo silang dalawa. o kung may pagtatalo man, malamang sa malamang maliit na bagay lang ‘yun. hindi yung ikakamatay mo!” isang labi ng lumapit sa tenga ni aling cecil, “alam mo tingin ko, baka inggit ‘yan. kasi si joe lang may trabaho sa kanilang dalawa, di ba? tapos si alex, wala pa rin sa kolehiyo. nag-aaral pa rin. sigurado akong ‘yun ang dahilan.” isa pang labi ang lumapit sa kabilang tenga naman ni aling cecil, “baka napikon na. kasi di ba halos s’ya na sa lahat ng gawaing bahay? baka pakiramdam n’ya porke’t mas malaki ambag ng kapatid n’ya , alila na s’ya neto.” isang labi naman na kaharap ni aling cecil ang nagsabing, “baka nagbabait-baitan lang kasi nga si joe ang halos sumasalo sa mga bayarin, pati sa pag-aaral n’ya. pero galit talaga s’ya, kasi baka naman may pagkakataong mas nabibigyang-atensyon si joe kahit hindi n’yo napapansin. kasi halimbawa uuwi s’yang pagod galing sa trabaho, syempre di n’yo maiwasang alagaan, pagsilbihan.” sa gitna ng mga labing ito’y si aling cecil, at ang ideyang unti-unting nabubuo dahil sa mga sinasabi ng mga labi sa kanya. “siguro,” sabi n’ya. “siguro nga.” **abbie** ang pangalan n’ya’y abbie. social worker daw s’ya. pagpasok n’ya’y agad bumungad sa’kin ang asul na bra sa ilalim ng dilaw na blouse nang tapatan ito ng liwanag mula sa bintanang katabi ko. sa kanyang pagtali ng buhok ay nakita kong basang-basa na ang kanyang kili-kili at kumikinang na sa pawis ang kanyang leeg. “alex?” sabi n’ya habang maya’t-mayang tinutulak ng kanyang daliri ang salamin n’yang dumudulas sa kanyang matangos na ilong. “bakit di mo ikwento muna sa’kin ang nangyari bago tayo umalis dito?” pasensya ka na, abbie. hindi ko nagawang sabihin kay chairman, na kilala pa mandin namin. hinding-hindi ko rin masasabi sa’yo. walang ibang maglalahad ng nangyari kun’di ang mga taong nais magbigay kahulugan dito, kasi kung ako tatanungin kung bakit, sa totoo lang, hindi ko rin alam ang isasagot. may nabasag akong bote sa kusina kanina, at sa pagpulot ko nito’y pumasok sa isip ko ang isang udyok. yung tipo ng udyok kapag nasa mataas kang lugar, at bigla mo na lang gustong itulak ang kasama mo. pero alam mong hindi ito dapat gawin, at kakapit ka pa nang mas mahigpit sa kanila para masiguro mong hindi ito mangyayari. ang udyok na ito’y nagsabi sa’kin na isaksak ko kay kuya ang basag na bote. at nalaman ko na lang na totoo na pala ang lahat nang dumapo sa aking balat ang mainit na dugo ni kuya. nahinto lang ako nang maramdaman ko ang buto sa leeg n’ya at nang marinig kong nabibilaukan na s’ya sa kanyang sariling dugo. hindi ko pa rin alam kung bakit. sana, tulad ng iniisip ni chairman, ay nasapian na nga lang ako. pero nakita ko ang lahat, andun ako. hindi ko lang alam na totoo pala ang lahat. namatay si kuya joe sa wala. at hindi ko matanggap na wala. normal lang sana ang sabado namin. tahimik. nanonood lang si kuya ng tv, naglilinis ako sa kusina. si nanay nama’y namamalengke ng pananghalian namin. bicol express daw ang lulutuin n’ya. puta, sinira ko ang araw. gusto kong umiyak dahil hindi na kami babalik sa salo-salo namin. “alex?” muling tawag ni abbie. “gusto kong malaman kung bakit. tayong dalawa lang. kaibigan mo ko dito. hinding-hindi ko ‘to sasabihin sa nanay mo, sa mga kapitbahay n’yo. may mga naririnig ako sa labas na dahil daw sa inggit? totoo ba ‘to? sa inggit nga? magmula nang dinala ako ni chairman dito sa maliit na kwartong ito’y napagpasyahan kong manahimik na lang sa nangyari. sa ngayo’y nilalabanan ko ang mga luha, nilalabanan ko ang panginginig ng aking bibig, at ang mga salitang gustong lumabas mula sa’kin. dapat mukhang hindi ko pinagsisisihan. dapat mukha akong galit. para naman mabigyang halaga, mabigyan ng ibig-sabihin ang pagkamatay ni kuya joe. dapat tinatatak ko sa utak ko na dapat lang! dapat lang sa kanya ang nangyari. dapat hindi ako bibigay. dahil kapag natalo ako, mamatay talaga sa wala si kuya. “sige, kung ayaw mong magkwento, ako muna. kasi naalala ko ‘tong isang batang babae at ang tatay n’yang abusado. tatay n’yang lasinggero. tatay n’yang isang beses s’yang hinipuan sa kanyang sariling kwarto at pinilit. ampon ang batang ‘yon, at tatay-tatayan n’ya lang etong umaabuso sa kanya. takot na takot ang bata dahil pakiramdam n’ya isang gabi’y papatayin na lang s’ya bigla neto. kaya naman isang gabi, nang bigla s’yang pinuntahan ng kanyang tatay upang pagsamantalahan ulit, sinasaksak ito ng bata gamit ang lapis sa mata, sa leeg, at sa dibdib.” kumuha ng panyo si abbie. sa kanyang paggalaw ay muling sumisilip ang kanyang bra sa likod ng blouse na parang mga batang naglalaro sa likod ng kurtina. “masarap sa pakiramdam, pero pumapatay pa rin s’ya ng tao. ilan taon n’yang dinibdib ‘yun. hanggang ngayon nararamdaman pa rin n’ya ang mga kamay ng tatay n’ya sa kanyang ari. sa kanyang dibdib. ilang taon bago n’ya matanggap ang ginawa n’ya. ngayon, medyo mahirap pa ring ikwento, pero kahit papaano’y kaya ko na. nangyari na kasi.” para bang may sumuntok sa aking dibdib nang marinig ko ‘to. bigla kong tinanggal ang aking paningin sa kanyang bra, at sa paggalaw ng aking mga mata’y bigla kong naramdaman ang pamumuo ng mga luha. “ayos lang, alex. pero andito lang ako. aalagaan ka muna namin. tapos pag handa ka na, makikinig ako. kahit pakonte-konte pa, ayos lang. aantayin kong mabuo ang kwento mo.” bumibilis bigla ang tibok ng puso ko. lalong nanginginig ang aking labi. at biglang pumasok si kuya sa isip ko, tumatakbo papalayo sa akin. mga bata pa kami, at hinahabol ko s’ya. “alex?” kuya wag kang lumayo! “alex?” kuya dito ka lang! kailangan kita dito! “sige, ayusin na natin pag-alis mo.” at parang isang batang nadapa sa semento, dito na walang awat na tumulo ang luha sa aking mga mata. “alex?” “hindi ko rin alam… hindi… ko rin alam. sorry, kuya! sorry! hindi ko rin alam kung bakit! patayin n’yo na lang ako! hindi ko alam anong nangyari! hindi ko na kaya!” lumalabo na ang aking paningin, pero kahit ga’no kalabo ang aking mga mata’y kitang-kita ko ang gulat at takot sa mukha ni abbie. pasensya ka na, kuya.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/nlygsa/alex_tanghaling_tapat_ng_sabado_2021/,27 05 2021

I wish people will stop adopting kids for the sake of magkaroon ng anak.,"ganito kasi, mga lods. kanina during breakfast, my dad told us na his older sister will officially be disowning her adopted son. well, di naman na minor yun. he's turning 20 this year. my aunt's reason is masyado na raw matigas ang ulo at hindi na makontrol. my dad is with her. sabi pa nga niya, walang utang na loob yung cousin ko lalo pa di naman nga raw namin kadugo pero pinalaki pa rin ni tita. pero iba ang nakikita ko e. my cousin was neglected. sure, pinakain siya at pinag-aral, but he never really had a parent figure. pinapabayaan lang maggala kasi masyadong busy ang parents niya. on top of that, our other cousins dislike him for the obvious reason he's adopted. lagi siyang kinukutsa. kaya di na rin ako nagulat na malayo ang loob niya sa lahat, except sakin. we're not really close talaga, pero kapag nagkasama naman kami (say, sa inuman or nagkasalubong), wala namang awkward air between us (take note: introvert ako, and i'm not close with my other cousins either). then, i remember this one time when our aunt told him right into his face na ""hindi ka kabilang sa pamilya na to"". i was there. kahit ako, nagulat sa sinabi ni tita. we recently talked about it, and he admitted na tumatak sa isip niya iyon. he's just 8 that time (12 naman ako). siguro para sa iba, sasabihin na lang na my cousin should be thankful pa rin dahil nga at least naranasan niya ang buhay marangya. after all, his real parents were just teenagers when he was conceived. pareho pang mahirap. pero ang akin lang, di naman kasi puro pera lang ang kailangan ng isang tao, especially a child. mas matimbang pa rin ang emotional support. kumbaga sa pagbuo ng bahay, it doesn't matter kung gaano kamahal at kaganda ang materyales na gagamitin mo. kung itatayo mo iyan nang walang pundasyon, bibigay din yan agad. ganoon din sa tao. alam nyo napapaisip ako tuloy bigla. what if my cousin was not treated differently? mabait naman kasi siya sa totoo lang. i never understand the hate, lalo na sa mga adult sa pamilya namin (like that tita i mentioned). makulit siguro siya, yes, pero mabait siya. and if my older relatives will just sit down and actually listen to him bago sila magalit, i think madali lang namang malulutas ang problema na to. but nah. we're in the philippines. old people can never be wrong here. sa mga planong mag-adopt dyan, please, pag-isipan n'yo munang mabuti kung talagang kaya n'yo bang panindigan ang responsibilidad sa aampunin n'yo. those children are not toys na kapag nanawa ka, pwede mong i-set aside. tao iyan. and being a parent is a lifelong commitment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/mjmz4i/i_wish_people_will_stop_adopting_kids_for_the/,4 04 2021

""sandali,"" sagot niya. sabay abot sa akin ng mga halos tigbe-bente singko na barya.

My thanksgiving dinner experience with a BBM family.,"so eto nga guys, nag-punta kami (me (f), my wife (f) my sister and her bf) reluctantly sa invitation ng ilocano-bbm tita na kapit-bahay namin. may pinag-samahan naman yung family kahit papano, before elections super ganda ng communication namin sa kanila kasi kapitbahay namin dito sa canada. saktong usapan lang, nag-dasal kami bago kumain. to be honest, ang ganda nung prayer. as an agnostic, na-appreciate ko naman siya. pero gagi, yung kapatid ko brining-up yung pag-unfriend ko sa tito ko na misogynistic bbm supporter din tapos sabi sakin bigla nung bbm na tita: ""kayo kasi maka-leni kayong lahat diba? dapat di na kayo nagpapa-niwala sa kwento kwento lang. dapat sa totoong news sources lang."" mind you, binigyan ko lang siya nuon ng heads-up na fake yung website source niya (halatang fake kasi no actual sources from credible organizations, news sites, people, also the ones she sent me usually walang https:// (unsecure-doesnt mean all with https:// are legit as well) tapos yung design nung buong site, parang cult na may agila, illuminati sht - web designer and dev ako) tapos kinimkim pala niya yun. di ko nalang tinuloy yung pag-rebut ko kasi yung wife ko natatakot na magalit ako. i was very polite about it kasi mas matanda siya sakin and i was just looking out for her. then na-bring up nanaman ng kapatid ko about yung recently nangyari kay leila de lima. gagi nagulat ako sabi ng panganay niyang babae, ""dapat pinatay na nila yun. tinuluyan na dapat sinaksak."" sabay silang pamilyang tumawa (aside sa bunso na awkward sa situation) i felt chills. paanong nakakapag-dasal ng ganun kaganda tapos without any hesitations, would wish harm on other people just like that. ps. sinabihan din nung bbm tita yung mom ko directly bakit ako nag-cocomment and nag-popost na kumakalaban sa views niya. tas sabi ni bbm tita ""isang post mo nalang eh sasampalin na kita."" sabay tawa. eto din isang kinagalit ko sila yung traditional toxis filipino family. lakas nilang i-body shame yung asawa ko sa harap ko? muntik na talaga nag-liparan ang mga lumpia. anyways, officially cut ties with them na. may bbm supporter akong mga kakilala pero not that extreme (madalas dahil lang kasi ilocano. &nbsp; &nbsp; (edit) just to answer some questions. &nbsp; > quote q1. why was politics bough up nung dinner? i did not want to talk about politics because i knew it was going to be a mess, pero my sister thought our casual arguments sa fb nuon nung tita is civil and casual. she thought wrong. she had no idea the tita was extremely pro-marcos. she tried to change the topic but we decided na umalis bago magka-gulo (because i get really unpleasant pag nasimulan ko nang magalit and isa yun sa puna ng wife ko sakin kaya ayaw ko siya lalo ma-stress) anywho, lesson learned sa kapatid ko lol &nbsp; >quote q2. di bako sumagot or stoop up for what i believe in? i tried. di sa pag-tanggol sa pagkatalo or sa binoto ko, pero sa misinformation na nagbblur sa totoo at hindi. ang sagot sakin ""naniniwala ka kasi sa fake news. dun ka sa totoong balita lang. wag sa kwento kwento sa facebook at tiktok."" can't argue with people who always things they're right. siya nag-banggit na kay leni kami nag-vote last election and my side of the family all nodded (said ""yes. syempre tita."") then she proceeded to complain about the philippines being poor right now and then overcompensating sa pag-puri kay bbm after niya magreklamo. lol also i don't ever want to stoop low para makipag-sampalan at murahan sa harap nung bunso nila (na awkwardly listening to her mom talk about marcos. i guess she's the ""odd"" one in the family.) &nbsp; >quote q3. but they body-shamed your wife? di ka pumatol? as mentioned i can become harsh pag galit ako. my wife doesn't like me when i'm at that point of anger kaya we just looked at each other and signaled na umalis na. although i told them my wife is building strength kasi nag-ddeadlift siya. di nila alam ata kung ano yun. tbh nung tumahimik ako, napansin nung bf ng sister ko and akala daw nila may gagawin ako. i'm honestly surprised i held it in like that. i'm quite proud of myself. charot &nbsp; >quote q4. important ba sila sa inyo? nung bago-bago palang kami sa canada isa yung tita na nagshashare ng food niya samin sa work, nag-lolook out for us and genuinely concerned if we were okay. kaya masakit din na this happened. &nbsp; >quote q5. anong nangyari sa fresh lumpia? binigyan kami ng pa-take home pero wala na gusto kumain. binalik ko yung plate nila kahapon pero di ko na kinausap. iniwan ko nalang sa pinto nila. &nbsp; &nbsp; >quote edit: clarified that not all websites with ""https://"" are legit din.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/y1fwdi/my_thanksgiving_dinner_experience_with_a_bbm/,11 10 2022

Why will a second lockdown kill the economy?,"pwede ba nating pagusapan kung bakit papatayin ng second lockdown ang economiya natin? isa din akong business owner and truth be told masakit yung unang lockdown (2 months). pero sa totoo lang pabor ako sa isa pang lockdown. pero tingnan muna nating kung ano ang situation ngayon 1. marami ng nagsara dahil sa unang lockdown 2. yung level ng consumer sa malls and even sa ibang establishment is hindi pa bumabalik 3. service sector kahit iopen pa yan ng iatf sa gcq, is practically dead too. 4. interconnected ang mundo, kahit hindi tayo mag lockdown if walang demand mag sasarado pa rin ang mga factory sa industrial park mga bagay na dapat gawin ng gobyerno 1. ibalik ang confidence ng publiko na gumastos ulit. paano? kailangan walang pangamba ang tao na manganganib ang buhay niya pag asa labas siya. (hindi nakakatulong ang punong ospital dito) 2. walang tulong pinansyal para sa mga negosyo. marami ng ngsara. pero siguro naman kung mag lolockdown tayo ng pangalawang beses may pondo na sila para dito. 3. kailangan ng isa pang sap. kailangan umikot ang pera. nung nalift ang ecq, back to normal ang sales ko. and sa tingin ko dahil ito sa sap. may pang gastos pa ang mga tao. iba na ang sitwasyon sa nakaraang 2ng linggo. 4. hindi pwedeng ang 50% economy 50% health approach. kung lockdown, lockdown talaga. kung economy pinili mo buksan mo lahat. dapat magfocus muna tayo sa isang problema dahil palpak ang approach na pag resolba ng covid at economiya ng sabay",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/i1rpny/why_will_a_second_lockdown_kill_the_economy/,1 08 2020
"Kapag namulat sa katotohanan, kasalanang nang pumikit","my sister cried to me a while ago when she learned that our kasambahay who voted for bbm said “nandyan naman si lord” at nakangiti pa siya nung sinabi ko na “ate magdasal dasal ka na dahil paupo na si bbm” kasi it’s really possible that she might lose her work because of our plans to migrate asap. to give a background sa maid namin, may ugali siya na di namin nagugustuhan. she always lies. pag nagpapabili kami sa kanya dati sasabihin niya na sakto ang pera but we learned na kinupit niya yung natira. plastic din siya. pag napagsabihan siya, tatalikod tapos may sasabihing di maganda. and noong nagpaulan ng katigasan ng ulo, sinalo niya lahat. hindi lang namin siya ma-let go kasi mahirap talaga maghanap ng household help ngayong pandemic so pinagtiyatiyagaan kaysa wala. then we learned na she’s voting for bbm. we tried to convince her but to no avail, gusto niya talaga si bbm dahil sa nagawa raw ng tatay. and ayun nga matigas ulo ni ate. so back to my sister, when she learned na sinabi ni ate na “nandyan naman si lord” nagalit ang kapatid ko kasi hindi naman talaga namin plano magmigrate agad, so lahat ng plans ng sister ko parang uncertain na. iyak siya ng iyak. sabi niya “sinira nila ang future ko dahil lang sa simpleng ignorance” she’s only 17 pero ito na ang nararamdaman niya. ilang araw na siyang umiiyak dahil hindi niya alam ang mangyayari sa future niya. when i was 17, pinoproblema ko lang kung saan ako magkacollege. nakakalungkot kasi ang mga taong katulad ni ate parang walang pakialam. dahil maayos naman siyang pinapasweldo hindi niya na naiisip ang iba. alam ko nabiktima si ate ng fake news dahil lagi ko siya naririnig na nakikinig sa propaganda sa youtube at tiktok pero di kami nagkulang sa pagpapaintindi at pagdedebunk ng tama sa mali. ilang beses ko rin pinanood sa kanya ang mga videos ni chris tan. wala pa rin. kahit biktima siya ng fake news, accountable pa rin siya. sabi nga nila kapag namulat ka sa katotohanan, kasalanan nang pumikit. nakakalungkot lang dahil mataas pride ni ate mas pinili niya pa rin ang binoto niya. lahat tayo nadamay pa. and to my sister, i’m really sorry our country failed you. i hope it will be all right for you soon.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/uokxgk/kapag_namulat_sa_katotohanan_kasalanang_nang/,13 05 2022

ANNOYING THINGS RELIGIOUS PEOPLE/GROUPS DO. (TLDR if you're not interested),"i'm atheist and naturally, i find religion pointless and a load of self-indulgent egotistical nonsense but i mostly keep it to myself unless otherwise provoked. i don't go out into the streets and shove atheism down other people's throats - and for the record bwiset din ako sa mga atheists na sobrang outspoken na akala mo ikamamatay nila kapag di nila napatunayan na walang mga diyos. i don't give two fucks if friends and fam alike subscribe to a religion that promotes and encourages bigotry, homophobia, etc. as long as they don't break the law or interfere with my life so i won't go there. instead, i'll focus on the things that they do na nakakaabala sa mga nakapaligid sa kanila (in particular order). and don't even get me started dun sa mga nageendorse ng mga kandidato kapag eleksyon tapos may drama pang laying of the hands sa ulo habang nakapikit yung mga hudas na pulitiko. **1. jehovah's witnesses** ***-*** *the most annoying of the lot. the fact that they turn up during the most inconvenient hours on weekends (esp. while you're busy doing housework) makes me even want to smash them on the head with a really heavy leatherbound bible with decorative brass edges and an enormous medallion embossed in the center. afaik sila rin ang dahilan kung bakit nag-ooverflow ang basurahan ko dahil sa mga nyetang flyers na pinagsisisingit nila sa mga gilid-gilid ng gate. and lastly, kung ubos na ang slots para sa mga maliligtas ay makakapasok sa langit e bakit pa sila nag-eeffort magkayag ng mga bagong miyembro? saan mapupunta yung mga new recruits? house seats, fifth row center in the great theater in the sky? jesus wept.* **2. born again christians** (and pretty much any other christian denomination) *- at least they don't go knocking on people's doors on weekends but they have the resilience of a cockroach. they keep harping on and on and on about ""the lord"" and they'll drag you to join them na magsimba sa church nila if they could. tila di ata sila makabuo ng isang sentence na hindi nasisingit yung phrase na ""si/ni/kay lord"" to the point na naiirita nako every time na marinig ko na banggitin nila yang ""si lord"" nila. i find that rude kase in my case, those people were fully aware na atheist ako. lalo na kapag humirit na sila ng ""diba kapag may napanood kang magandang movie ang tendency mo is ikuwento mo?"" i told them na okay given that's the case, kaya lang kapag paulit ulit mo nang ineendorse yang lecheng movie na yan pero hanggang ngayon hindi parin interesado yung kausap mo it's time to give it a rest na diba? and guess what? not everyone fucking digs harry potter, game of thrones, lord of the rings, etc. and that's perfectly fine. you don't have to get so worked up about it.* **3. roman catholics** *- my major beef with this religion i grew up with is when the powers-that-be interfere with politics. although naiintindihan ko kse may vested interest yung mga higher-ups sa pagpapatakbo ng bansa. roman catholicism is not the most financially-literate religious group in the world for nothing. not to mention we practice catholicism of the most outdated and antiquated sort dito kaya ayun, naging hindrance kase may mga progressive laws sa western world na dapat noon pa naipatupad dito (e.g. abortion, divorce, etc.) kaya lang hinahadlangan ng mga powerful at nagtatabaang mga bishops. unfortunately, it appears secularization is nothing but a pipe dream dito sa pilipinas.* **4. iglesia ni cristo** *- eto pa isa pa to. in due time magdedemand narin to ng mga sangkatutak na holidays na dapat irecognize ng buong sambayanan. but at least they stick to their own kind kaya i find them tolerable most of the time naman. not sure kung may nagbabahay-bahay sa kanila kase wala pa naman akong naencounter. pero once na magsimulang magdemand to na ipagbawal ang mga kung anu-anong bagay-bagay dahil against sa belief system nila ay p\*t\*n\*i\*a there will be blood!* **5. mormons (church of jesus of latter-day saints)** *- paminsan minsan may naeencounter ako nito pero kahit nagbabahay-bahay din sila so far wala namang nagpainit ng ulo ko. i just told them politely i'm an atheist and i don't (and won't ever) subscribe to any organized religion and that's it, they just said their goodbyes sans fanfare. nakakaaliw pa nga yung mga kano na sobrang fluent magtagalog e. minsan nga kino-coach ko pa e kse may mga ginagamit silang tagalog words na sobrang quaint na at baka mapagtawanan pa sila.* **6. muslims** *- the ones i find the most tolerable. they stick to their own kind like all the time. and contrary to popular belief, they're mostly peaceful and they tend to leave others well alone as long as you don't try to offend them on purpose. may mga muslim friends nga ako nung college na kaharap ko pa kpg kumakain ako ng barbecue wala lang sa kanila dedma lang and di namin dinidiscuss it in the first place. they rarely engage in pointless religious debates with non-muslims. yung suki ko nga dati nung uso pa ang pirated dvds nagbebenta pa ng mga religious movies kpg malapit na ang holy week e. as an animal rights advocate i'm not in favor of some jalal practices though...* the rest tulad ng mga buddhists, hindus at jewish bihira ako maka-encounter ng mga members nila kaya wala ako ma-criticize sa mga gawain nila. nung bata ako may naalala pa nga akong grupo ng mga hindus na once in a while nagpaparada sa kalsada tapos namimigay ng popcorn na nakabalot sa papel de hapon kaya may extra brownie points pa sila sakin. minsan nga 2 pa ang nahihingi ko e. :p &#x200b; end of rant.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/xr4ir5/annoying_things_religious_peoplegroups_do_tldr_if/,29 09 2022

"informing y’all about OCD, the most misunderstood mental illness","contamination ocd ay istorbo sa buhay obsessively fearing on rabies and covid-19 made me crazy and irrational as heck. konting may mahawakan, madikitan ng kamay or katawan, spray ng alcohol at hugas ng kamay real quick. ako ang dahilan bakit may krisis kami sa alcohol sa bahay. even if i don’t want to, magdi-disinfect talaga ako using alcohol for the sake of safety, not to harm myself. napapagalitan na ’ko sa pag-ubos ng alcohol. hugas din ako nang hugas ng kamay, to the point na puti na ang palad ko, manipis na, papasukan na ng foreign microbes dahil manipis na nga at wala nang proteksyon. napapagalitan din ako, “oa” na raw haha. ayoko na ng ganito, ‘yung “what ifs” ko sa utak are controlling my life, driving me to do compulsions and destroys my critical thinking skills, and kapag walang pang-disinfect, yari na, balisa na ’ko, sobrang intolerance ng katawan ko sa uncertainty, saka automatically catastrophic thinking na ang utak ko, just worst-case scenarios na ang iniisip.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/16q69az/informing_yall_about_ocd_the_most_misunderstood/,23 09 2023

What does Albularyo do (witch doctor/folk healer)? Do they really do something? May naniniwala pa ba sa kanila in this generation?,"so i have a brother, he's 25 year old. we rushed him twice in the hospital this week. pero prior pa sa mga episodes na'to, he's feeling symptoms already eg. tightness of chest, nagka-cramps ang katawan niya, difficulty sleeping, nahihirapan huminga, etc. after all the medical exams, okay naman lahat ng results niya, normal lahat ng test. a friend of his advised him to go to albularyo (which i am against kasi i think he's having mental health problems talaga which affects he's overall being since yung mga symptoms niya ay linked to anxiety and depression eg. panic attacks/difficulty breathing). but i just let them para sa peace of mind na rin na atleast we all did everything possible kahit na talagang kapos kami, we just don't want him to feel na pinapabayaan namin siya. so fastforward kung saan pumunta yung albularyo sa bahay, wala naman siyang masyadong ginawa. may sinabi na may lumalaro raw sa kapatid ko (nangkukulam daw sa kanya), mas marami pa actually yung pagboboast niya na he's done something for someone, na siya yung reason kung bakit nalaman kung sino yung kumuha sa wallet ng isa niyang pasyente (?). he's just engaging us in the conversation. he also said na yung mga ibibigay niyang papakuluan at iinumin ay exported pa raw and such. and to my surprise p4000 lahat yung siningil niya for that session only. he's not the typical albularyo rin, naka-car siya and mukha namang well-off. do you think reasonable yun as bayad? i mean, may mga naririnig naman na akong albularyo before pero usually hindi ganun kalaki ang hinihingi nila. since parang act of altruism yon in their part since meron silang god-given gift. i don't have anything against sa mga albularyo or naniniwala/nagpeperform nga mga ganoong rituals pero i felt robbed for me and sa kuya ko kasi we chipped in sa bayad. malaking bagay na yon para samin, he's living paycheck to paycheck and i'm still reviewing for my boards so big deal talaga yun sakin. and if ever may magtanong kung bakit hindi ko na lang sinuggest na magvisit ng psychologist. it is still not acknowledge sa amin, especially sa pamilya namin. and simply not accessible. (how can i put it into words) parang still stuck sa phase na ""nasa isip mo lang yan."" bottomline, are albularyos a thing? am i just overreacting sa bayad? edit: i'm reading all your comments guys and i really appreciate them. pero hindi ko lahat ma-process right now kasi my manung just talked to the albularyo, and he's asking him 5k kasi may ritual daw silang gagawin bukas and he's gonna bathe him with god knows what and how, at hindi pa sure kung yun na yung last na hihingin niya. and he assured him daw na 'pag 'di gumaling, ibabalik daw yung binayad. i really can't process anything right now kasi i'm thinking na baka this is only the beginning nung mga paghingi hingi niya, and knowing my brother he really won't listen to any of us. edit: please don't share this with any platform update: i took your advice guys and told him na he should instead see a therapist since malaking bagay yung hinihinging 5k. i also forwarded informative videos na very similar sa mga symptoms na nafifeel niya na linked to anxiety. unfortunately, umutang daw siya ng pambayad and binayaran na niya. and he won't acknowledge yung idea na maybe he has anxiety. sobrang close minded niya with regards doon. i'll just hope and pray for the placebo effect.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/17nhpid/what_does_albularyo_do_witch_doctorfolk_healer_do/,4 11 2023

My thanksgiving dinner experience with a BBM family.,"so eto nga guys, nag-punta kami (me (f), my wife (f) my sister and her bf) reluctantly sa invitation ng ilocano-bbm tita na kapit-bahay namin. may pinag-samahan naman yung family kahit papano, before elections super ganda ng communication namin sa kanila kasi kapitbahay namin dito sa canada. saktong usapan lang, nag-dasal kami bago kumain. to be honest, ang ganda nung prayer. as an agnostic, na-appreciate ko naman siya. pero gagi, yung kapatid ko brining-up yung pag-unfriend ko sa tito ko na misogynistic bbm supporter din tapos sabi sakin bigla nung bbm na tita: ""kayo kasi maka-leni kayong lahat diba? dapat di na kayo nagpapa-niwala sa kwento kwento lang. dapat sa totoong news sources lang."" mind you, binigyan ko lang siya nuon ng heads-up na fake yung website source niya (halatang fake kasi no actual sources from credible organizations, news sites, people, also the ones she sent me usually walang https:// (unsecure-doesnt mean all with https:// are legit as well) tapos yung design nung buong site, parang cult na may agila, illuminati sht - web designer and dev ako) tapos kinimkim pala niya yun. di ko nalang tinuloy yung pag-rebut ko kasi yung wife ko natatakot na magalit ako. i was very polite about it kasi mas matanda siya sakin and i was just looking out for her. then na-bring up nanaman ng kapatid ko about yung recently nangyari kay leila de lima. gagi nagulat ako sabi ng panganay niyang babae, ""dapat pinatay na nila yun. tinuluyan na dapat sinaksak."" sabay silang pamilyang tumawa (aside sa bunso na awkward sa situation) i felt chills. paanong nakakapag-dasal ng ganun kaganda tapos without any hesitations, would wish harm on other people just like that. ps. sinabihan din nung bbm tita yung mom ko directly bakit ako nag-cocomment and nag-popost na kumakalaban sa views niya. tas sabi ni bbm tita ""isang post mo nalang eh sasampalin na kita."" sabay tawa. eto din isang kinagalit ko sila yung traditional toxis filipino family. lakas nilang i-body shame yung asawa ko sa harap ko? muntik na talaga nag-liparan ang mga lumpia. anyways, officially cut ties with them na. may bbm supporter akong mga kakilala pero not that extreme (madalas dahil lang kasi ilocano. &nbsp; &nbsp; (edit) just to answer some questions. &nbsp; > quote q1. why was politics bough up nung dinner? i did not want to talk about politics because i knew it was going to be a mess, pero my sister thought our casual arguments sa fb nuon nung tita is civil and casual. she thought wrong. she had no idea the tita was extremely pro-marcos. she tried to change the topic but we decided na umalis bago magka-gulo (because i get really unpleasant pag nasimulan ko nang magalit and isa yun sa puna ng wife ko sakin kaya ayaw ko siya lalo ma-stress) anywho, lesson learned sa kapatid ko lol &nbsp; >quote q2. di bako sumagot or stoop up for what i believe in? i tried. di sa pag-tanggol sa pagkatalo or sa binoto ko, pero sa misinformation na nagbblur sa totoo at hindi. ang sagot sakin ""naniniwala ka kasi sa fake news. dun ka sa totoong balita lang. wag sa kwento kwento sa facebook at tiktok."" can't argue with people who always things they're right. siya nag-banggit na kay leni kami nag-vote last election and my side of the family all nodded (said ""yes. syempre tita."") then she proceeded to complain about the philippines being poor right now and then overcompensating sa pag-puri kay bbm after niya magreklamo. lol also i don't ever want to stoop low para makipag-sampalan at murahan sa harap nung bunso nila (na awkwardly listening to her mom talk about marcos. i guess she's the ""odd"" one in the family.) &nbsp; >quote q3. but they body-shamed your wife? di ka pumatol? as mentioned i can become harsh pag galit ako. my wife doesn't like me when i'm at that point of anger kaya we just looked at each other and signaled na umalis na. although i told them my wife is building strength kasi nag-ddeadlift siya. di nila alam ata kung ano yun. tbh nung tumahimik ako, napansin nung bf ng sister ko and akala daw nila may gagawin ako. i'm honestly surprised i held it in like that. i'm quite proud of myself. charot &nbsp; >quote q4. important ba sila sa inyo? nung bago-bago palang kami sa canada isa yung tita na nagshashare ng food niya samin sa work, nag-lolook out for us and genuinely concerned if we were okay. kaya masakit din na this happened. &nbsp; >quote q5. anong nangyari sa fresh lumpia? binigyan kami ng pa-take home pero wala na gusto kumain. binalik ko yung plate nila kahapon pero di ko na kinausap. iniwan ko nalang sa pinto nila. &nbsp; &nbsp; >quote edit: clarified that not all websites with ""https://"" are legit din.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/y1fwdi/my_thanksgiving_dinner_experience_with_a_bbm/,11 10 2022

The 6th Stage: Defiance,"so, ayun na nga. ibang mundo na ang ating gigisingan. the dragon has fully reared its head. duterte coming into power in 2016 was but a tendril of smoke heralding the return of a marcos-with an all new cast of cronies! super. ngayon, sabay sabay natin matututunan ang totoong ibig sabihin ng pagtindig laban sa karimarimarim na dilim. tulad ng paglaban ng mga lolo’t lola, nanay, at tatay natin nung 1972. training wheels are off. totoo nga na papunta na tayo sa exciting part. nakakatakot. nakakapangilabot na yung dating mga binabasa mo lang, napapanuod mo lang sa dokyumentaryo, baka makita mo na sa mundong ginagalawan mo. nung una, i did not know how to cope, so lahat ng brand ng copium tinikman ko. hagulgol. galit. ang bobobo, ang tatanga! nangangako ng aalis na. alexa, show me afams in my area. but curiously, as the most turbulent of the emotions eased, something remained. tahimik lang siya habang inuubos ng kaluluwa ko ang kalungkutan. ngayon na humihina na, mas naririnig ko siya, unflinching and steadfast. i feel defiant, *in a way that i have never felt like in my life*. baka ang tadhana ni vp leni ay hindi ang manalo noong may 9, kundi sindihan ang totoong kilusan. marami satin, siguro parang namatayan ngayon. pero may nabuhay rin. it’s new, tentative. pero it is a force that cannot be denied. rivulets of water that will eventually cleave apart solid stone. yung grit ng mga tao na nanatili hanggang 6:30am para lang makaboto. this anger? this movement? it is ours. it is *us*. there is no taking it away. sabi nga ni vp leni, ang mulat, hindi na muli mapipikit. pretty words if heard a week ago. ngayon, habang hindi makatulog at makapigil sa pagluha ang marami satin, siguro mas naiintindihan natin ang bigat ng ibig niyang sabihin. it is painful because you know. i believe it is that pain and grief that will keep us moving. masakit maging mulat. masakit hindi bumitaw. madalas ko isipin kung paano ba ako magsusurvive sa rehimen na ganito. hindi ko alam ang lahat ng sagot, pero may apat ako na suggestion na pwede pagsimulan: first: alagaan ang sarili. mahaba pa ang gabi. kailangan maganda't gwapo tayo hanggang mag-umaga. eat well, exercise, hydrate, meditate, stay centered, cry if you need to, know when you need to step away. you will need all of yourself during the coming years. second: mag-ingat online. alam naman natin na kasama sa technique ang red-tagging and troll farms. ingatan ang sensitive and personal information. don’t give them anything to work with. third: digital budd(ies) system. kung ang social media ay tool na ginamit para ilubog tayo, that means we can also use it to work in our favor. gamitin para bumunot ng lakas sa isa’t isa. now is not the time to isolate yourself. if you’re not already doing so, follow inspirational folks like chel diokno and walden bello. kahit hindi lang para sa balita, kahit paalala lang na hindi ka nag-iisa. fourth: do not forget who is really at fault. may magandang video si atty luke espiritu sa page niya sa fb (bawal maglink, pero madaling mahanap) explaining why it is not the masses who are to blame. we gain *nothing* from alienating and attacking each other, while evil counts on us staying divided. yung mga nagsasabi na stop helping para mapressure yung gobyerno, i do not think that will work. this is a government that will not care. we will be punishing the wrong people, and their oppressors will twist the truth to turn us even harder against each other. kung vp leni supporter ka, tulad ng marami satin dito, you would be betraying the principles she stands for. kahit yung mga nakain ng fake news and misinformation, biktima lahat yan. hindi natin alam ilang taon unti-unting binabago ng propaganda ang perception nila ng katotohan. the machinery has been hard at work for years. palagay ko, ngayon palang natin totoong sisimulan ang pagrehabilitate. the real evil are the people who willfully and deliberately voted because they had power to gain. the real evil are the structures and elites who produced marcos jr. yakap. mahal kita at ipaglalaban kita, sa kung paano ko man kakayanin. stay safe, stay defiant, folks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/unpff9/the_6th_stage_defiance/,12 05 2022

Ano technique ninyo para tulungan ang parents ninyo na sumunod sa COVID guidelines?,"see title. yung magulang ko ay in their late 60s na. yung father ko, kahit anong pagmamakaawa gawin ko, pilit pa din lumalabas for non-essentials, tapos ayaw magsuot ng mask. hindi naman niya need lumabas kasi sapat naman passive income for daily needs, kaso pag pinakisuyuan mo na shelter in place, kung ano anong idinadahilan. hindi ko alam kung dahil ba ayaw niyang mawala ang ""independence"" niya, bored sa bahay, o sadyang hindi lang sineseryoso yung threat ng covid. pag kinakausap namin at nire-request na magsuot ng mask pag lumabas, kaartehan lang daw yung mask tapos tinatamad daw magsuot. ang masakit, nung sinabi namin na ""paano kung mahawa ka?"", ang sagot ba naman eh, ""kung mahawa, edi mahawa, bahala na."" i love my parents deeply and ayaw na ayaw ko na may mangyari sa kanila. ano ginawa ninyo para matulungan ang mga matitigas ang ulo na kamag-anak na seryosohin yung mga safety precautions sa covid?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/jqd8ha/ano_technique_ninyo_para_tulungan_ang_parents/,8 11 2020

Tagalized Story.,"may story ako. ako lang ang nag-iisang babae sa pinag-tatrabahuhan kong kumpanya at alam ko na kung bakit. isa akong fresh graduate sa kolehiyo at gusto ko na talagang makapag-simula ng career agad-agad na walang kinalaman sa pagse-serve ng pagkain, pagpupunas ng mga gamit, o pag-dadala o timpla ng kape sa isang matandang negosyante. sa naka-sanayan nag-aapply ako sa trabaho na may anim na araw na trabaho at marami-rami na rin akong interview na napagdaanan. alam ko na ang tinapos kong hrm na kurso ay hindi gaanong makaka-kuha ng magandang oportunidad, pero naniniwala pa rin ako na may mas maganda pang trabaho na naghihintay sa akin. kaya naman nanatili akong positibo, matyaga, at nag-aapply lang sa mga office jobs na may magandang benipisyo. kahit halos wala na akong mapag-kunan ng makakain dahil sa magastos na mga interview, at least mapapag-tibay naman nito ang kakaunting pride na natitira sa akin. halos tatlong linggo na rin ang nakalipas, may isa akong phone interview sa isang internet security company. ang kumpanyang iyon ay maraming offices sa amin at naghahanap sila ng bagong customer support specialist para sa kanilang international department. ang mga requirements ay maganda o mahinahon na boses, good spoken and written grammar, kakaunting tech-knowledge, at may kakayahang mag-trabaho sa umaga at gabi. ang office ay dalawang sakay lang sa mula sa amin, at mayroon silang magandang offer sa health insurance. nag-aapply ako kahit lmitado lang din ang alam ko sa computer science. naging maayos naman ang phone interview at matapos ang dalawang meetings sa hr at sa management, binigyan nila ako ng isang napaka-gandang offer (kahit na wala pa talaga akong experience sa kahit anong trabaho). sa loob ng unang linggo ko, kailangan kong magtrabaho nang regular shift na 9-5 (am) para maging online ako kasabay ng manager ko, na nag-trabaho sa ibang branch ng kumpanya. pagkatapos noon ay kailangan kong magtrabaho para sa regular na schedule ko bilang support - ang schedule ko ay 6 na araw na pasok (09:00 am -05:00 pm (am) at may isang araw na night shift 09:00 pm - 05:00 am respectively). sa unang araw ko, ang suot ko ay isang loose na sweater at mahabang skirt. bilang sa kaalaman ko ay sa ganitong uri ng trabaho ay karamihan mga lalaki ang empleyado, ayaw ko naman mag-cause ng unnecessary attention dahil sa provocatively o inappropriately pag-susuot ng hindi naayon na attire. ang lalaki sa front desk ay mukha namang maayos na tao. pinakilala n'ya ang sarili n'ya bilang si andrew bago n'ya ako tulungang mag-fill out ng mga paperwork at sinamahan n'ya na ako sa aking mesa at sa isang open space na workspace. nakatitig lang ako sa tila walang katapusang mga desks habang naglalakad kami, napansin ko na halos hindi mo makikita ang mga mukha ng bawat taong nagta-trabaho na naka-upo sa bawat desks. wala man lang akong nakita o napansin na babae habang nag-lalakad kami sa tila baga'y walang katapusang workspace na iyon, na talaga namang hindi normal at nakaka-bahala. kahit ang kalmadong presensya ni andrew ay hindi kayang maiwaglit ang wari kakaibang pakiramdam na naka-tuon sa akin. halos maubusan ako ng hininga ng maramdaman ko ang mga presensya ng bagong kong co-workers na tila nagsasabi na ""hindi ka nababagay dito"". nagulat ako ng biglang huminto si andrew sa isang desk na napuno ng mga printed memes, floral stickers, at isang lumang keychain na naka-patong sa harap ng monitor. bukod pa doon ay natatakpan na rin ng makapal na alikabok ang keyboard, monitor at ang natitirang ispasyo ng desk. ""ahhh... anong nangyari..."" sabi ni andrew sa medyo upset na boses. ""pasensya ka na."" sabi nito habang nakatingin sa aking mga papeles. ""ah... aya. dapat matagal na 'tong nalinis. kailangan kong maka-usap ang custodian"". ""ok lang 'yun"", sagot ko. ""puwede ko namang punasan na lang 'yan, wala namang problema"". medyo asiwa na noon si andrew, pero habang ginagala ko ang aking paningin ay malinaw na wala ng ibang bakanteng desk maliban doon. mabilis na natapos ang araw na iyon. natutunan ko na ang mga dapat kung gawin na sumagot sa support related phone calls at gumawa ng bagong ticket para sa system. kailangan ko ring i-monitor ang lahat ng pumapasok na chats at written tickets at isaayos ito base sa level ng urgency at type nito. hindi naman ako required mag-bigay ng technical advice, pero dapat maging pamilyar ako sa aming product software. bilang wala pa namang mga tawag ay pinaki-alaman ko muna ang manual. halos wala akong maintindihan sa mga naroon kaya naman ginogle ko na lang ang karamihan na nasa manual. kinumusta ako noon ng manager ko at mukhang hindi s'ya masaya sa mga lapses ko sa mga materials. dahil pakiramdam ko wala akong matinong nagawa at gagawin sa mga oras na iyon ay panandalian akong nag-break para linisin ang mesa ko. tumayo ako para tanungin si andrew kung saan makaka-kuha ng basahan para sa mesa ko. agad-agad kong pinagsisihan ang desisyon kong iyon. ang bawat mata sa kwarto ay tila napako sa pagtayo ko sa aking kinauupuan. hindi ako sigurado pero maraming mga bulungan akong narinig habang papalayo ako sa aking mesa. ang kaninang maingay na mga keyboard ay pahina nang pahina na halos kainin na ako ng lupa sa sobrang hindi ko pagiging kumportable at self-conscious na rin at the same time. napansin ko na lang na halos halikan ko na ang dibdib ko sa pagyuko para lang hindi ako mapansin. bago ako maka-rating sa isang palikong daan patungo sa front desk ay buong-lakas kong tinignan ang isang tila walang hiyang lalaki na nakatitig sa akin. hindi ko alam kung ano ang inaasahan ko, pero 'yung overall appearance ng lalaking naka-hooding pang-asar na 'yun ay nagbigay ng matinding kilabot sa buong katawan ko. siguro mga ka-edad ko s'ya pero hindi man lang s'ya nahiya o natinag sa pagkaka-titig n'ya sa akin sa kabila ng pagtitig ko sa kanya na may halong pagka-bwisit at inis. isang kakila-kilabot na ngiti ang sumilaw sa mga labi nito habang naka-titig sa parteng bukong-bukong ng aking mga paa at dahan-dahan itong bumalik sa kanyang monitor. inisip ko kung anong magiging reaksyon n'ya kapag tinitigan ko rin ng kaparehong paraan ng pagtitig n'ya sa akin ang tinitigyawat n'yang leeg. parehong reaksyon pa rin ang nakuha ko habang naglalakad ako pabalik sa aking mesa kasama ang box ng computer wipes sa mga kamay ko. may maganda ring nangyari sa araw na iyon. habang nililinis ko ang mga drawer ng mesa ko ay may nakita akong half-used notebook mula sa nakaraang nagta-trabaho sa mesa ko. hindi n'ya nilagay ang first name n'ya, kundi initial lang at last name: j. espiritu. pero, base sa dekorasyon ng notebook, sigurado ako na babae rin s'ya kagaya ko. ang mga naiwan n'yang gamit ay nagbigay ng kapanatagan sa akin, pero 'yung notebook ang talagang pumukaw ng atensyon ko. doon ay sinabi nito ang pina-ikli at simpleng manual gamit ang easy-to-undertand terms at mga explenasyon sa nakaka-litong terminolohiya at komplikadong panuto sa manual. sa tulong n'ya ay nasurpresa ko ang aking manager sa aking product knowledge pagkatapos ng shift ko. matapos ang isang magandang araw ay buong tapang akong gumala sa office at nag-explore sa pantry. binenta ni andrew sa akin ang top-notch coffee machine at snacks sa nasabing pantry, tutal nagugutom na rin naman ako matapos ang isang emotionally, intellectually and productive na araw na 'yun. (ansabe). tsaka, medyo butas na rin 'yung bulsa at namumula na ang mga credit cards ko, kaya naman ayos na ako sa ilang pirasong masasarap na cookies. habang papalapit ako ay may narinig akong malakas na usapan at tawanan sa pantry. sa katangahan ko ay inisip ko na baka naman mas mainit, friendly o kahit maka-tao na sila sa akin. subalit ang maliit na pantry ay napuno ng katahimikan the moment na pumasok ako sa pantry. may limang lalaki doon na mag-kakaiba ang edad at lalaki na naka-upo sa palibot ng isang maliit na lamesa, at lahat sila ay naka-titig na direkta sa akin. ""panget na araw?"" - tugon ng isang pang-asar na boses. agad kong itinaas ang ulo ko mula sa pagkaka-titig sa sahig para hanapin ang pinag-mulan ng boses. hindi naging mahirap sa aking hanapin at malaman na mula iyon sa naka-hoodie na walang-hiyang tumitig sa akin nung nakaraan lang. ""siguro marami ka ng experience?"" - sambit pa nito sa nakaka-asar na tono at may-unting pag-taas ng kilay. ""para makakuha ng komportableng trabaho. siguro sikat ka?"". ""ano 'to, high-school?"" - sagot ko sa malakas na boses. hindi ko hilig kumompronta ng tao, pero sobra na 'to. hostility is one thing, social awkwardness is another, pero pakiramdam ko isa 'tong 80's na high-school drama na mga trenta anyos ang mga bida bilang mga teenagers. ""nandito lang ako para kumuha kape at kung may problema ka sa trabaho ko, puwede mong dalhin sa hr kung ano man ang issue mo"". nagpatuloy ako habang ine-enjoy ang namumutla at pahiyang mukha ng mga taong 'yun. mabuti naman, gusto kong maramdaman nila ang katiting na discomfort na buong araw kung kinakaharap. pinili kong lumayo sa aking mga co-workers, naglakad ako ng taas noo pabalik sa mesa ko na may hawak-hawak na tasa ng kape. bago pa ako maka-upo at enjoyin ang masarap na kape, napansin kong may isang mensahe galing sa hindi kilalang number: ""you have quite an attitude, don't you?"" nanigas ako habang hawak ang cell phone sa isa kong kamay at kape sa kabila. habang prino-proseso ko ang tila breach sa personal security ko, naka-tanggap ulit ako ng dalawa pang mensahe. isa ay ang hubo't-hubad kong katawan na sinend ko sa una kong serious college boyfriend. ang pangalawa: ""bakit hindi mo ngayon ibigay 'yang picture sa hr?"" sa totoo lang, sobrang naapektuhan ako sa invasion ng privacy ko. pumasok ang kahihiyan sa akin at sobrang naiinis ako for drawing so much unwanted attention sa sarili ko. kasalanan ko lahat 'to. pumasok ako sa isang office na puno ng ethical hackers na may pare-parehong pangalan ng aso bilang password. walang duda na ang litratong iyon ay umiikot na sa buong office at lahat ng iyon ay salamat sa walang hiyang ka-trabaho ko, at isa na akong kakatuwang tao sa loob ng office. hindi ko na ginalaw ang kape ko at umuwi na lang, habang pinipigilan ko ang bawat emosyon na bumuhos hanggang makarating ako sa safety ng bahay. halos hindi ako matigil sa kaiiyak nung gabing 'yun, iniisip ko na ang mga mukha ng mga ka-trabaho ko habang tigang na tigang na nakatitig sa hubad kong katawan. mga alas tres na ng madaling araw, doon ko lang na-realize na wala ng kwenta para pa magpaka-lunod ako sa kahihiyan. kailangan kong gumawa ng plano para maka-survive sa ganitong uri ng workplace. quitting is not an option kasi masyadong malaki ang pasweldo nila para tumigil ako. tsaka, halos tinapay na lang ang kaya kong bilhin sa araw-araw. ang pangalawa kong option ay pumunta sa hr, but there's no way i was going to open that can of worms. hindi ko mapapatunayan kong sino talaga ang nag-send ng mga mensahe na iyon. last option? stick with it, keep my head down, gawin ang trabaho na pinasukan ko at 'wag pansinin ang iba pang mga harassment na gagawin nila. 'yun nga ang ginawa ko. sa kabuuan ng isang linggong training ko ay pumapasok ako on time, hindi ako umaalis sa desk ko liban na lang kung pupunta sa palikuran. iniwasan ko rin ang kahit anong contact kanino man at pinanatili ko lang ang aking mga mata sa mga inanimate objects. salamat kay j. espiritu, palagi akong on top ng training ko. sa bawat bagong task na galing sa manager ko, laging may katumbas na entry sa kanyang notebook. wala ng nakaka-gagong texts at face-to-face na kumprontasyon, pero mayroong kakatuwang pakiramdam na panibagong sisira sa kalagayan ko. sa darating na biyernes na ang huling training ko, na nagdala sa akin sa huling entry sa notebook. night shift survival guide: - matulog sa buong umaga bago ang shift at 'wag na 'wag kang matutulog. - walang sino man ang dapat maka-pasok. - panatilihing may pepper spray na dala. (sa kahit anong sitwasyon). - i-check ang bawat aisle, meeting rooms. huwag kalimutang i-check ang ilalim ng lamesa, balkonahe, kitchen tables at kahit likod ng cooler. - laging mag-open ng skype na naka-ready sa emergency in case na hindi gumana ang mobile services. - panatilihing updated sa kaibigan/pamilya/lover kada oras. ang nasabing listahan ay medyo may kahulugan. una, sabi ng hr puwede naman akong matulog sa pagitan ng 2-5 am, basta malapit palagi sa akin ang office smartphone. mayroon nga silang pull out couch sa isang conference room para lang talaga sa ganitong sitwasyon. pangalawa, ang buong shift ay phone calls, kaya palaging may paraan para maka-tawag mula sa office phone, tama? lastly, ang mga naka-outlined sa ""guide"" ay parang o.a at paranoid. siguro 'yung listahan ay satirical? (ewan ko). siguro si espiritu parehas kami ng pakiramdam tungkol sa mga tila patay gutom na mga asong cold-blooded na co-workers? pero 'yung isip ko nag-tatrabaho ng sobra-sobra para makita ang logic sa likod ng mga pag-iingat na ito. may kakatuwa akong pakiramdam na may importanteng impormasyon akong hindi nalalaman. lahat 'yun iniisip ko habang paalis ako ng bahay nung biyernes na 'yun, last day ng training ko. ""andrew"", - dahan-dahan akong lumapit sa kanya. ""puwede ba mag-tanong?"" ""sure thing"", - sagot n'ya na may maaliwalas na ngiti sa kanyang mga labi. ""nagtataka lang ako, bakit wala akong nakikitang ibang support agents. i mean, 'di ba dapat merong at least lima pang tao para ma-cover 'yung six-day rotation cycle?"" ""kailangan mong tanungin ang manager mo tungkol d'yan. most likely naka-kalat sila sa iba pang branch sa syudad. normal lang naman 'yun sa ganoong kaso"", - sagot n'ya. pakiramdam ko tapos na kami sa diskusyon na 'yun matapos s'yang bumalik sa final tasks n'ya para sa linggong iyon. ""meron bang ibang agent na nag-trabaho dito liban sa akin?"" - pagpapatuloy ko, dahil ganun na lamang ang kagustuhan kong malaman ang iba pang detalye sa babaeng nag-fill out ng notebook na s'ya namang ginagamit ko sa buong linggong iyon. ""oo, may isang babae na humawak sa posisyon mo ng panandalian"", - ani ni andrew, habang naka-titig pa rin sa screen ng kanyang screen. pero napansin kong tumigil na s'ya sa pag-tatype o pag-galaw ng mouse. wari ko ay naka-titig lang s'ya sa iisang spot sa monitor n'ya. ""andrew"", - nag-salubong ang mga kilay ko. ""sino 'yung nag-trabaho malapit sa main working space na talagang nakaka-inis? maputla, medyo payat, maitim at kulot na buhok?"" - tanong ko, habang nagpapaikot ng daliri sa bandang ulunan ko para i-describe ang pagkaka-kulot ng nasabing lalake. ""ah... si michael"", - sagot nito, napansin nito ang pagiging iritable ng boses ko. ""may problema ba? ginugulo ka ba n'ya?"" ""hindi"" - sagot ko, pero sa isip-isip ko ay nagtatalo na ang emosyon at sarili ko. ""have a good weekend, andrew"" ""ikaw din"", - sagot nito, halata na may pagtataka sa boses nito habang papaalis ako. sa buong weekend na 'yun ay binabalik-balikan ko ang mga nangyari sa akin sa unang linggo ko. pakiramdam ko may hindi sinasabi si andrew sa akin na importante. wala namang rason para maging iretable s'ya nung nabanggit ko 'yung babaeng nag-trabaho bago ako. may nag-reklamo na kaya kay michael dati? pu-puwede kayang si j. espiritu? si michael ba ang dahilan ng survival guide sa notebook? bakit s'ya umalis? napaka-daming teorya ang bumagabag sa buong weekend ko. bago ko pa nalaman, oras na para bumalik sa trabaho. ito ang araw na talagang sobrang daming trabaho. kahapon ay lunes, ang unang regular day shift. mabilis lang dumaan ang nasabing araw, habang aligaga ako sa pag-sagot ng tawag, recording, sorting at assigning ng dose-dosenang customer complaints sa system namin. hindi sapat ang salitang nasanay na ako at pagkatapos ng araw na 'yun ay sobrang pagod at ubos na ako. saktong maglo-logout na ako, naka-tanggap na naman ako ng mensahe mula sa hindi kilalang number. ""ang sipag mo naman. hindi na ako makapag-hintay na mag night shift ka"" seryoso?! ito ang kauna-unahang mensahe na bumalot sa buong pagkatao ko ng takot. agad-agad kong ginala ang paningin ko kung nasa paligid ba si michael para kumprontahin ko s'ya sa pagse-send ng mensahe, pero kanina pa pala s'ya umalis. matapos kong pakalmahin ang sarili ko, umuwi na ako at sinusubukan kong hanapin si j. espiritu online. ang pinaka best bet ko noon ay sa linkedin, at doon nga ay sinusubukan kong galugarin ang buong listahan ng mga babae na may kinalaman sa proficient technologies na naka-lagay sa profile nila (halos kakaunti lang talaga sila). nung wala akong makita ay pumunta ako kay andrew at doon nga sa friend list n'ya ay sa wakas nakita ko na ang hinahanap ko. may babae na pangalan ay jennah espiritu at unemployed ang status. nag-send ako ng friend request na may mensahe na nag-papakilala at tinanong ko s'ya kung hinarass ba s'ya ng isa n'yang ka-trabaho. sa wakas, pakiramdam ko may patutunguhan na ako, natulog ako at inihanda ang sarili para sa bukas na event. naisip ko na baka may kakaibang mangyayari dahil sa pagbabago ng schedule nung natulog ako ng miyerkules. nag-check ako ng linkedin halos pagka-gising ko mga ala una. walang kahit anong sign kay jennah, kaya naman natulog ulit ako para makapag-handa sa night shift. medyo kinakabahan ako at excited at the same time kasi puwede ko ng mas malibot ang buong place of work ko intimately. dahil walang day crowd, malaya akong makaka-gala at ma-eenjoy ang cookies, dumura sa baso ni michael, kahit ano! may mga iilan pa ring mga nag-tatrabaho nung dumating ako para sa shift ko, pero hindi ko naman iyon pinansin at dahil sa nag-uumapaw na mga tawag at chats na aasikasuhin. makalipas ang dalawang oras, ang bugso ng mga tawag at chats pati mga tickets ay unti-unting bumagal hanggang tuluyan na nga itong tumigil ng sabay-sabay halos alas onse na ng gabi noon. sumandal ako sa kinauupuan ko at ginala-gala ang mga paningin sa aking workspace. wala ng tao noon sa office at least sa nakikita ko. naka-bukas ang lahat ng ilaw pero nung tinanggal ko ang headphones ko, may narinig akong mahinang jingling melody sa hindi kalayuan. para s'yang christmas carol, pero hirap akong tukuyin kong saan ito nangga-galing. wala namang dahilan para matakot ako sa pangyayari, pero pakiramdam ko ang mga nagtayuang balahibo sa mga kamay ko ay nagsilbing alarm. nang tumayo ako sa aking kinauupuan, nawala 'yung melody. well, naging paranoid na ako dati. minsan ko ng inisip na na may lalaking sumusunod sa akin isang gabi hanggang nilagpasan n'ya ako at nagtungo sa kalapit na tindahan sa 'di kalayuan. kahit mag-isa lang ako, lagi kong dino-double at triple check ang mga lock ng bahay bago matulog. aaminin ko na ang mga takot ko ay wala naman talagang basehan. mayroong naka-iwan ng headphones na konektado pa rin sa computer nito at naka-on ang music. o siguro may office party sa ibang kumpanya sa baba ng building. ang makarinig ng kanta ay nakaka-takot lamang sa mga kakatuwang horror movies, 'di ba? 'di ba?! para maka-siguro, hinalughog ko ang office para maka-siguro na mag-isa na nga lang ako. habang naglalakad sa gitna ng mga magkaka-dikit na desks, naisip ko kung gaano ako ka-swerte na mayroon akong sariling corner spot. hindi ko siguro kakayanin na mapalapit sa kahit sinong mga hindi kaaya-aya kong mga co-workers. matapos ko ma-check ang bawat rows ay dumiretcho ako sa front desk area at nagmamasid sa mga kagamitan ni andrew sa paghahanap ng clues. nung wala akong makitang clues ay bumalik ako sa main room ng pantry. unti-unti ng mas nagiging relaxed ang mga senses ko at tsaka ko lang napag-tanto na napasarap ata ang taste-testing ko sa mga cookies sa halip na mag-hanap ng mga kahina-hinalang mga bagay. kailangan ko ng tumigil sa kaka-kain ng cookies, pero dahil bumalik na naman ang kaninang tunog na naririnig ko, mas malakas s'ya ngayon. at the same time, ang work smartphone ko (na kinakailangan dala-dala namin kung aalis kami sa aming work station) tumunog at may mensahe mula sa hindi na namang kilalang number. so, nag-eenjoy ka ba sa cookies, ha? nanigas ang buong katawan ko habang prino-proseso ng utak ko ang mga pangyayari. siguro hindi talaga umalis ng office si michael at ngayon tinatakot ako. kinalikot ko ang tenga ko noon at nakinig ng maigi. walang kahit sino sa pantry as least sa nakikita at naririnig ko. tsaka, kung si michael ay nasa main workspace, hindi naman ganun kahirap na hulaan o sabihin na kumakain ako ng cookies. habang dahan-dahan akong humihinga, hindi ko muna pinansin ang tunog at nakinig ako ng maigi kung may iba pa akong tunog na maririnig. wala. dahan-dahan, naglakad ako sa may pantry drawers at doon may nakita akong malaking kutsilyo. alam ko bang gumamit ng kutsilyo? hindi. kaya ko kayang paalisin kung sino man ang unarmed na kalaban? syempre. papunta na sana ako pabalik sa aking work station ng biglang may tawag na pumasok mula sa work phone. ipinosisyon ko ang sarili ko ng kumportable sa pader ng pantry, kutsilyo sa kanang kamay, cell phone sa kabila, bago pa ako maka-sagot with the standard customer support greeting. nag static na sa kabilang linya at iba pang ingay sunod ang tuluyang pagka-putol ng linya at katahimikan. nung tinignan ko ang cell phone, nakita kong naka-patay na ito. sinubukan kong buksan ulit ito, pero hindi na ito gumagana. ok, ngayon kailangan ko ng bumalik sa computer ko in case na may pumasok pang mga tawag. naalala ko bigla ang isa sa mga guide na galing kay jennah habang isinusuksok ko ang walang kwentang cell phone sa bulsa ko. - laging mag-open ng skype na naka-ready sa emergency in case na hindi gumana ang mobile services. nangyari rin kaya 'to sa kanya? ang mga instructions sa notebook ay unti-unti ng nagkaroon ng kahulugan, at minumura ko ang sarili ko dahil sa pagiging tanga. sa oras na lumabas ang mga salita sa bibig ko ay may isa na namang mensahe ang dumating sa cell phone. kinuha ko iyon at sinubukang i-unlock, pero 'yung regular home screen ay hindi lumalabas. ang lumabas lang ay isang white screen na may maikling text. putang ina. ang mga babae dapat hindi ginagamit ng ganung mga uri ng salita. matapos kong mabasa 'yun ay nawala na ito sa screen at may panibagong text ang lumabas. bakit hindi ka lumabas at makipag-laro? huwag mo ng isiping bitbitin pa 'yang kutsilyong hawak mo. wala ring magagawa 'yan sa hawak kong baril. tinapon ko ang cell phone ko sa lapag at agad-agad ay nagtungo ako sa aking computer. ang tunog ay mas lalong lumakas habang papalapit ako sa aking lamesa, doon ay nakita kong may isang baboy na stuffed toy. may fabric button ito sa bandang paanan at music note na kasama. dito nagmumula ang tunog at nagpapatunay lamang na hindi ako mag-isa at may kung sino akong kasama. ang malala pa, pinapanood nila ang bawat galaw ko at sinusubukang takutin gamit ang mga laruang pambata. unti-unti ng dumadaloy ang pagpapanic sa aking buong katawan at naghahanda na sa fight or flight scenario. huminga ako ng malalim, sinusubukan kong pakalmahin ang buong katawan ko. so far wala pa naman akong naririnig ng kahit anong palatandaan na may ibang tao sa loob ng office. may mga background noises galing sa syudad sa labas at ang mga ingay mula sa naka-limutang patayin na computer ng isang employee. kung sino man ang gumagawa nito sa akin, kailangan kong malaman ang kanilang eksaktong lokasyon para maplano ko ng maayos ang pag-takas ko. isa pa, kailangan kong maka-kuha ng tulong sa lalong mas madaling panahon. habang iginigilid ko ang laruan ay umupo na ako sa aking upuan at pinull-up ang skype for business application. mabilis akong nag-dial ng 911, habang naka-loudspeaker ang telepono. tumunog na nga ang dial tone at agad-agad ay may live operator na sa kabilang linya. ibibigay ko na sana ang mga hindi kanais-nais na pangyayari sa akin ng mga oras na iyon ng may biglang humawak sa bukong-bukong ko mula sa ilalim ng lamesa. halos maubos ang buong lakas ko sa pagsigaw habang nagpu-pumiglas ang mga paa at mabilis na tumakbo sa abot ng aking makakaya sa bilis na hindi ko akaling kaya ko. may narinig akong kung anong kumusyon sa aking likuran habang tumakbo, kasunod ng isang malakas ng putok, na inisip ko na lamang na galing sa kung ano o sino man ang humahabol sa akin. bago ko pa malaman ay halos nasa ground floor na ako papunta sa pinto lagpas sa gwardiya na halatang nagulat sa mga nangyayari. ang malamig na hangin ay mabilis na pumasok sa manipis kong sweater habang papalapit ako sa isang malapit na pedestrian para humingi ng tulong. tumawag sila ng 911 at ang mga pulis ay agad namang dumating wala pang sampung minuto. habang naghihintay ako kasama ang gwardiya para sa kanilang pag-dating, hindi maalis sa isip ko ang sinulat ni jennah na warning, at kung gaano ako ka-tanga para ipagsa walang bahala ang mga ito. - i-check ang ang bawat aisle, meeting room. huwag kalimutang i-check ang ilalim ng lamesa, balkonahe, kitchen tables at kahit likod ng cooler. agad-agad namang sinulat ng pulis ang mga nangyari sa akin at iniwan ako kasama ang isang pulis officer, umakyat s'ya para i-check ang office. wala namang naka-labas-masok sa building mula nung tumakbo ako palabas, kaya malaki ang posibilidad na naroroon pa rin ang salarin at nagtatago sa loob. sa pag-iisip ay halos bumaliktad ang buong sikmura ko at mas lalo akong lumapit sa may armas kong kasama. maya-maya pa matapos kaming iwanan ng mga pulis, ang kasama kong pulis ay nag-radyo at isa-isa may mga boses na nagpapa-palit-palit sa radyo na humingi ng backup at nga mga codes na hindi ko maintindihan. mabilis na nag-escalate ang mga sumunod na pangyayari. imbis na pauwi ay dinala nila ako sa police station at doon ay nanatili ako sa isang interrogation room ng halos 2 oras bago pa sa wakas may dalawang pulis officer ang kumausap sa akin. pagod na ako noon, miserable ang kalagayan at higit sa lahat litong-lito sa kung papaano naganap ang mga pangyayari. gusto ko ng umuwi pero nanatili pa ako ng ilang oras para i-kuwento ang mga pangyayari sa dalawang pulis officer. 'ahh... meron kang kutsilyong hawak habang tumakbo ka galing sa pantry papunta sa lamesa mo? sigurado ka ba?' tanong ng isang nakaka-tandang officer na nagpakilala bilang senior investigator manlapig. 'ah. ah... oo.' pautal-utal kong sagot sa kanya. 'naniniwala akong meron. nag-papanic na ako noon, kaya mahirap sabihin. tapos may baboy na stuffed toy, ' sabi ko, habang tila baga'y nawawalan ako ng abilidad na mag-isip ng tama. 'at naniniwala ka na ang taong humaharass sa'yo ay si michael villareal?' sabi ng isa pang officer, hindi ko maalala 'yung pangalan n'ya. wala s'yang badge. 'hindi ko alam buong pangalan n'ya, pero wala na akong ibang kilala na iba pang responsable.' 'at sa huling pagkakataon, just for the record, anong nangyari matapos mong mag-dial ng 911?' tanong ni manlapig sa ika-apat na pagkakataon sa gabing 'yun. 'may kung sino ang humawak sa binti ko. bukong-bukong, actually. nangyari 'yun bago pa ako magkaroon ng pagkakataong ipaliwanag ang sitwasyon sa operator. nagsusumigaw at piglas ang mga paa ko tapos tumakbo hanggang may makita akong tao sa labas na pina-tawag ako sa 911 para sa tulong.' sagot ko, habang pagod na pagod sa paulit-ulit at paikot-ikot na pagtatanong. 'si michael villareal ay natagpuang patay sa hindi kalayuan ng iyong lamesa nung pumunta ang officer namin sa pinang-yarihan ng insidente. nakita mo ba ang kanyang katawan nung tumakbo ka palabas ng office?' tanong ng isang officer. halos malaglag ang panga ko sa mga narinig ko at tumitig sa dalawang pulis habang balisa at nanginginig sa takot. 'hi.. hi.. hindi,' pabulong akong nag-salita, 'hindi ko maintindihan,' 'sinaksak s'ya hanggang sa mamatay gamit ang malaking kutsilyo. ang katawan n'ya ay balot ng dalawampu't-tatlong saksak,' paliwanag ni manlapig. 'at nakita namin ang kutsilyo ay nakabaon sa bibig nito, dahilan para dumikit ito sa sahig diretcho sa lalamunan,' 'may rason kami para pagsuspetyahan na ito rin ang sinasabi mong kutsilyo,' dagdag pa ng pangalawang officer. nakatitig ako sa dalawang pulis officer ng tahimik, hirap akong intindihin ang mga pangyayari lalo na't ang utak ko ay halos mawala na sa ulirat. 'ang mga sinabi mo ay nagpapatunay lamang sa mga natagpuaan namin sa cell phone ni michael villareal. nalaman namin na may roon siyang hacking apps,' pagpapatuloy ng senior officer. 'natagpuan din naman ang ilan mo pang mga hubong larawan at ang mga mensahe na iyong nabanggit. mayroon s'yang baril at nakita rin naman ang basyo ng bala nung binaril ka n'ya habang papatakas ka.' 'ang hindi namin maintindihan ay kung papaano s'ya namatay.' dagdag pa ng pangalawang officer, halatang hindi s'ya naniniwala sa aking reaksyon. 'ok lang kung napatay mo s'ya dahil sa self-defense, aya. may balak s'yang masama sa'yo.' 'hindi,' pautal-utal kong sagot. 'pangako, wala akong ideya... oh, oh my god.' naiyak na ako dahil sa mga nangyayari. 'ibig kong sabihin, nung nakaraang buwan lang may nag-report sa kanya galing sa isa n'yang co-worker,' sabi ni manlapig. 'jennah,' bulong ko. 'kilala mo si miss espiritu?' tanong ng pangalawang officer, at ng suspetya sa kanyang mga mats. 'hindi,' ako ang pumalit sa lamesa n'ya at nakuha ko ang notebook n'ya. dapat sinabi ko na 'to kanina pa. anong sabi sa report? doon nga ay nagtitigan ang dalawang pulis at maka-lipas ang ilang sandali ay inilatag at ipinaliwanag ni manlapig ang mga hindi magandang nangyari kay jennah na halos mangyari na sa akin. si jennah espiritu ay dumiretcho sa pinaka-malapit na hospital mula sa kanyang unang night shift tatlong buwan na ang nakakaraan. sobrang bugbog ng katawan n'ya at sugatan, at gustong mag-file ng anonymous rape kit. ang natanong damage n'ya sa kanyang puwerta ay sobrang severe na kinailangan n'yang sumailalim sa operasyon at magpatahi. nag-file s'ya ng police report makalipas ang dalawang buwan matapos s'yang hindi pumasa sa probationary period sa inyong kumpanya, ng nawala s'ya sa trabaho (ang nagiisang paraan para mabayaran ang kanyang utang sa hospital). ang nangyari ay ang kanyang aligasyon kontra kay michael villareal, na gumastos s'ya ng malaki sama mo pa ang hindi mabilang na kanyang mga co-workers na kumontra sa kanya laban sa magalang at kaaya-ayang katangian ni michael. 'pero kahapon lang ay iniurong na n'ya lahat ng mga isinampa n'yang kaso kay michael,' sabi ng walang badge na pulis. 'kasalukuyan naming inaalam ang kinaroroonan ni espiritu para ma-interview namin s'ya. sigurado ako na ngayon malinaw na kung bakit may suspetya kami sa iyo bilang nakikilala mo espiritu.' nagpatuloy ang mga tanong ng dalawang pulis hanggang may isang lalaki na nag-abot sa kanya ng isang sobre. natukoy na ng forensics ang fingerprint na nakita sa kutsilyo at ang blood-spatter patterns. kinailangan ko ring mag-submit ng dna samples para maka-tulong sa imbestigasyon at sa wakas ay pina-uwi na nila ako. sa bahay, dahil sa sobrang pagod, hindi ako maka-tulog. wala akong gamit na naiuwi. bag, cell phone at kahit ang jacket ko ay kinailangan i-submit bilang ebidensya. kaya naman napilitan akong gamitin ang luma kong laptop, umaasa na malibang sa internet. ang browser ko ay naka-login pa rin sa linkedin account ko mula sa nakaraang login, at nirefreshed ko ang page bilang naka-sanayan. isang maliit na red icon ang lumitaw na mayroon akong bagong mensahe. jennah. nagre-reply na s'ya sa akin. don't worry, sis. i took care of it. ❤️",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/t77k69/tagalized_story/,5 03 2022

What does Albularyo do (witch doctor/folk healer)? Do they really do something? May naniniwala pa ba sa kanila in this generation?,"so i have a brother, he's 25 year old. we rushed him twice in the hospital this week. pero prior pa sa mga episodes na'to, he's feeling symptoms already eg. tightness of chest, nagka-cramps ang katawan niya, difficulty sleeping, nahihirapan huminga, etc. after all the medical exams, okay naman lahat ng results niya, normal lahat ng test. a friend of his advised him to go to albularyo (which i am against kasi i think he's having mental health problems talaga which affects he's overall being since yung mga symptoms niya ay linked to anxiety and depression eg. panic attacks/difficulty breathing). but i just let them para sa peace of mind na rin na atleast we all did everything possible kahit na talagang kapos kami, we just don't want him to feel na pinapabayaan namin siya. so fastforward kung saan pumunta yung albularyo sa bahay, wala naman siyang masyadong ginawa. may sinabi na may lumalaro raw sa kapatid ko (nangkukulam daw sa kanya), mas marami pa actually yung pagboboast niya na he's done something for someone, na siya yung reason kung bakit nalaman kung sino yung kumuha sa wallet ng isa niyang pasyente (?). he's just engaging us in the conversation. he also said na yung mga ibibigay niyang papakuluan at iinumin ay exported pa raw and such. and to my surprise p4000 lahat yung siningil niya for that session only. he's not the typical albularyo rin, naka-car siya and mukha namang well-off. do you think reasonable yun as bayad? i mean, may mga naririnig naman na akong albularyo before pero usually hindi ganun kalaki ang hinihingi nila. since parang act of altruism yon in their part since meron silang god-given gift. i don't have anything against sa mga albularyo or naniniwala/nagpeperform nga mga ganoong rituals pero i felt robbed for me and sa kuya ko kasi we chipped in sa bayad. malaking bagay na yon para samin, he's living paycheck to paycheck and i'm still reviewing for my boards so big deal talaga yun sakin. and if ever may magtanong kung bakit hindi ko na lang sinuggest na magvisit ng psychologist. it is still not acknowledge sa amin, especially sa pamilya namin. and simply not accessible. (how can i put it into words) parang still stuck sa phase na ""nasa isip mo lang yan."" bottomline, are albularyos a thing? am i just overreacting sa bayad? edit: i'm reading all your comments guys and i really appreciate them. pero hindi ko lahat ma-process right now kasi my manung just talked to the albularyo, and he's asking him 5k kasi may ritual daw silang gagawin bukas and he's gonna bathe him with god knows what and how, at hindi pa sure kung yun na yung last na hihingin niya. and he assured him daw na 'pag 'di gumaling, ibabalik daw yung binayad. i really can't process anything right now kasi i'm thinking na baka this is only the beginning nung mga paghingi hingi niya, and knowing my brother he really won't listen to any of us. edit: please don't share this with any platform update: i took your advice guys and told him na he should instead see a therapist since malaking bagay yung hinihinging 5k. i also forwarded informative videos na very similar sa mga symptoms na nafifeel niya na linked to anxiety. unfortunately, umutang daw siya ng pambayad and binayaran na niya. and he won't acknowledge yung idea na maybe he has anxiety. sobrang close minded niya with regards doon. i'll just hope and pray for the placebo effect.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/17nhpid/what_does_albularyo_do_witch_doctorfolk_healer_do/,4 11 2023
Paano kayo nagccope up sa pagkawala ng mahal ninyo sa buhay?,"it's been 2 weeks since my father died. sobrang bilis, ang lakas niya pa lang tapos bigla na lang siyang nastroke. sabi ng doctor niya makakauwi na siya, pero yung day na dapat uuwi na siya ang day ng libing niya. hanggang ngayon, hindi pa rin mawala sa isip ko kung may pagkukulang ang mga doctor ni papa. doctor ni papa na cardiologist ang humawak sa case niya, nadiagnose siya ng hemorrhagic stroke, pumutok ang ugat sa utak niya at kailangan pigilan ang pagkalat ng dugo. sobrang confident namin sa doc ni papa kasi sabi magaling daw, ang sabi after 5 days ic-ct scan ulit si papa. ang lakas ni papa kahit nung 1-2 days niya sa icu. inaalis niya pa ngt sa ilong niya and malikot ang left side niya though hindi niya magalaw ang right side ng katawan niya at hindi namin siya makausap. 3rd day ni papa sa icu, sinabihan siya ng doctor niya na makakalabas na siya ng icu ng thursday (saturday ng madaling araw na stroke si papa at nadala namin siya agad sa ospital). at sabi, saturday makakauwi na siya sa amin. ayan ang advise ng doc niya sa amin bago umalis ang doc ni papa at nagseminar o may pinuntahan sa ibang bansa at iniwan sa isang doc na iternist. that day, nanghina si papa. ang dating malakas na grip na kamay niya at malikot niyang paggalaw ay humina... akala namin okay na... sobrang taranta na namin at late na na may nakapagsabi sa amin na kakilala na bakit walang neurologist si papa. kailangan daw niya neuro. late rin namin nalaman na cardio and internist doctors lang humahawak kay papa. before that, tanong na kami nang tanong sa mga nurses. nagtanong pa kami bakit hindi pa ict-scan si papa dahil nanghina siya. ang sabi, hindi na raw kailangan daw lalabas na siya. binawasan din mga gamot niya. kaso ang sabi nagka-infection daw siya sa dugo dahil hindi mawala ang lagnat niya kay binigyan siya ng antibiotics. thursday nang malaman namin na walang neuro si papa at kailangan niya ng neuro. pinilit namin na ipatingin si papa sa neuro kahit na nagagalit na samin mga nurses. cardio raw ang kailangan ni papa at hindi neuro. pinapirma kami ng waiver na kami ang nag-ask for neuro at hindi ang doctor ni papa. turns out, nang icheck siya ng neuro bakit daw hindi na-ct scan agad. dapat 2-3 days na ct scan daw ulit para malaman kung namaga utak ni papa. mali pa raw ang antibiotics na ibinibigay kay papa, sobrang baba raw dapat daw malakas dahil sa utak nga daw ang problema ni papa. thursday night, bumagsak katawan ni papa. ang gcs niya from 10 nang dinala namin siya sa ospital to 3. kumalat na daw ang dugo sa utak ni papa as per result ng ct scan sabi ng neuro niya baka kailanganin niya ng surgery. that night, sobrang bumaba bp niya, naging abnormal heartbeat niya at super nahirapan siyang huminga nilagyan na siya ng tube. super sakit akala namin makakauwi na siya tapos friday ng madaling araw nawala na siya. super sakit, before siya mastroke pinag-uusapan pa lang namin graduation ko. sabi niya super proud siya sa amin magkakapatid. ngayon hindi na niya ako makikitang ggraduate....yung panganay niya, walang tatay sa graduation. hindi ko alam kung may pagkukulang mga doctors niya or what, until now di pa rin namin nassettle ang bill. ang hirap magsalita kasi di naman kami expert pero para sa akin may pagkukulang sila. hindi ko sila sinisisi pero ang sama-sama ng loob ko!!! may times na parang okay na, pero kapag naaalala ko si papa... ang sakit-sakit, sobrang miss ko na siya. sobrang miss ko na ang papa ko. unang anak niya na mapapagraduate niya ng college, hindi niya makikita... kahit na mahirap, pinag-aaral niya kaming apat. ang sakit-sakit pa rin... hindi ko alam paano magccope up sa pagkawala ni papa...",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/14hwjjn/paano_kayo_nagccope_up_sa_pagkawala_ng_mahal/,24 06 2023

Ang hirap maging mahirap,"hi everyone! ito yung pinaka unang beses ko mag post sa reddit and unfortunately dahil pa sa sakit. (please bear with me). during college around 2014-2018 may nararamdaman na ako na pananakit sa sikmura pero sobrang hina or hindi ganon ka grabe then last week kumirot sya ng sobra so nag decide ako magpa er sa private hospital (since may hmo naman ako) pero hindi nila ako tinaggap dahil nung pagpunta ko ay nawala naman yung sakit so tolerable naman daw so nirefer nila ako sa outpatient then after ng mga procedures (labs), so ayun nga may gallstones ako. then na er ulit ako this week dahil hindi ko na kinaya yung aakit and need ko daw ng surgery tumanggi ako dahil baka hindi covered ng hmo ko (maxicare, 150k). bumalik ako sa unang hospital na pinuntahan ko so doon sa akin na explain yung surgery na gagawin which is yung ""open"" or ""laparoscopic"" at ang quotation is around 250k-350k depende pa kung walang ibang findings na makita understandable kasi private yung hospital. nag try ako pumunta sa mercado general hospital inc. sa compound ng pgh for second opinion then sabi sa akin ay aabutin ng around 75k-85k minus yung sa philhealth na around 15k daw so malaki pa din. working naman ako pero wala akong ipon dahil mahirap yung kalagayan namin at nag sisimula pa lang kami. ako lang din mag isa nag aasikaso ng lahat. kumakapit na lang ako sa kahit anong maliit na pag asa na nakikita ko, ayoko mapagod, ayaw ko mawalan ng pag asa pero bakit naman ganito. ang lala na ng anxiety ko na hindi ako makapag isip ng matino, ang daming tumatakbo sa isip ko gusto ko i rant isa isa pero baka ma bored lang kayo. so need ko po ng help/advise: 1. saang hospital may ganoon na procedure yung free or kung hindi man is yung covered ng hmo na hindi lalagpas sa 100k? 2. if ever saan po pwede manghingi ng cash assistance? at ano need na paper since ultrasound and medical certificate lang po ang meron ako. 3. or if may mga alam po kayo na pwede gawin para makapag undergo ng surgery na hindi need mag labas ng sobrang laking pera or mas better kung wala po thank you in advance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/13kauvf/ang_hirap_maging_mahirap/,17 05 2023

Tagalized Story.,"may story ako. ako lang ang nag-iisang babae sa pinag-tatrabahuhan kong kumpanya at alam ko na kung bakit. isa akong fresh graduate sa kolehiyo at gusto ko na talagang makapag-simula ng career agad-agad na walang kinalaman sa pagse-serve ng pagkain, pagpupunas ng mga gamit, o pag-dadala o timpla ng kape sa isang matandang negosyante. sa naka-sanayan nag-aapply ako sa trabaho na may anim na araw na trabaho at marami-rami na rin akong interview na napagdaanan. alam ko na ang tinapos kong hrm na kurso ay hindi gaanong makaka-kuha ng magandang oportunidad, pero naniniwala pa rin ako na may mas maganda pang trabaho na naghihintay sa akin. kaya naman nanatili akong positibo, matyaga, at nag-aapply lang sa mga office jobs na may magandang benipisyo. kahit halos wala na akong mapag-kunan ng makakain dahil sa magastos na mga interview, at least mapapag-tibay naman nito ang kakaunting pride na natitira sa akin. halos tatlong linggo na rin ang nakalipas, may isa akong phone interview sa isang internet security company. ang kumpanyang iyon ay maraming offices sa amin at naghahanap sila ng bagong customer support specialist para sa kanilang international department. ang mga requirements ay maganda o mahinahon na boses, good spoken and written grammar, kakaunting tech-knowledge, at may kakayahang mag-trabaho sa umaga at gabi. ang office ay dalawang sakay lang sa mula sa amin, at mayroon silang magandang offer sa health insurance. nag-aapply ako kahit lmitado lang din ang alam ko sa computer science. naging maayos naman ang phone interview at matapos ang dalawang meetings sa hr at sa management, binigyan nila ako ng isang napaka-gandang offer (kahit na wala pa talaga akong experience sa kahit anong trabaho). sa loob ng unang linggo ko, kailangan kong magtrabaho nang regular shift na 9-5 (am) para maging online ako kasabay ng manager ko, na nag-trabaho sa ibang branch ng kumpanya. pagkatapos noon ay kailangan kong magtrabaho para sa regular na schedule ko bilang support - ang schedule ko ay 6 na araw na pasok (09:00 am -05:00 pm (am) at may isang araw na night shift 09:00 pm - 05:00 am respectively). sa unang araw ko, ang suot ko ay isang loose na sweater at mahabang skirt. bilang sa kaalaman ko ay sa ganitong uri ng trabaho ay karamihan mga lalaki ang empleyado, ayaw ko naman mag-cause ng unnecessary attention dahil sa provocatively o inappropriately pag-susuot ng hindi naayon na attire. ang lalaki sa front desk ay mukha namang maayos na tao. pinakilala n'ya ang sarili n'ya bilang si andrew bago n'ya ako tulungang mag-fill out ng mga paperwork at sinamahan n'ya na ako sa aking mesa at sa isang open space na workspace. nakatitig lang ako sa tila walang katapusang mga desks habang naglalakad kami, napansin ko na halos hindi mo makikita ang mga mukha ng bawat taong nagta-trabaho na naka-upo sa bawat desks. wala man lang akong nakita o napansin na babae habang nag-lalakad kami sa tila baga'y walang katapusang workspace na iyon, na talaga namang hindi normal at nakaka-bahala. kahit ang kalmadong presensya ni andrew ay hindi kayang maiwaglit ang wari kakaibang pakiramdam na naka-tuon sa akin. halos maubusan ako ng hininga ng maramdaman ko ang mga presensya ng bagong kong co-workers na tila nagsasabi na ""hindi ka nababagay dito"". nagulat ako ng biglang huminto si andrew sa isang desk na napuno ng mga printed memes, floral stickers, at isang lumang keychain na naka-patong sa harap ng monitor. bukod pa doon ay natatakpan na rin ng makapal na alikabok ang keyboard, monitor at ang natitirang ispasyo ng desk. ""ahhh... anong nangyari..."" sabi ni andrew sa medyo upset na boses. ""pasensya ka na."" sabi nito habang nakatingin sa aking mga papeles. ""ah... aya. dapat matagal na 'tong nalinis. kailangan kong maka-usap ang custodian"". ""ok lang 'yun"", sagot ko. ""puwede ko namang punasan na lang 'yan, wala namang problema"". medyo asiwa na noon si andrew, pero habang ginagala ko ang aking paningin ay malinaw na wala ng ibang bakanteng desk maliban doon. mabilis na natapos ang araw na iyon. natutunan ko na ang mga dapat kung gawin na sumagot sa support related phone calls at gumawa ng bagong ticket para sa system. kailangan ko ring i-monitor ang lahat ng pumapasok na chats at written tickets at isaayos ito base sa level ng urgency at type nito. hindi naman ako required mag-bigay ng technical advice, pero dapat maging pamilyar ako sa aming product software. bilang wala pa namang mga tawag ay pinaki-alaman ko muna ang manual. halos wala akong maintindihan sa mga naroon kaya naman ginogle ko na lang ang karamihan na nasa manual. kinumusta ako noon ng manager ko at mukhang hindi s'ya masaya sa mga lapses ko sa mga materials. dahil pakiramdam ko wala akong matinong nagawa at gagawin sa mga oras na iyon ay panandalian akong nag-break para linisin ang mesa ko. tumayo ako para tanungin si andrew kung saan makaka-kuha ng basahan para sa mesa ko. agad-agad kong pinagsisihan ang desisyon kong iyon. ang bawat mata sa kwarto ay tila napako sa pagtayo ko sa aking kinauupuan. hindi ako sigurado pero maraming mga bulungan akong narinig habang papalayo ako sa aking mesa. ang kaninang maingay na mga keyboard ay pahina nang pahina na halos kainin na ako ng lupa sa sobrang hindi ko pagiging kumportable at self-conscious na rin at the same time. napansin ko na lang na halos halikan ko na ang dibdib ko sa pagyuko para lang hindi ako mapansin. bago ako maka-rating sa isang palikong daan patungo sa front desk ay buong-lakas kong tinignan ang isang tila walang hiyang lalaki na nakatitig sa akin. hindi ko alam kung ano ang inaasahan ko, pero 'yung overall appearance ng lalaking naka-hooding pang-asar na 'yun ay nagbigay ng matinding kilabot sa buong katawan ko. siguro mga ka-edad ko s'ya pero hindi man lang s'ya nahiya o natinag sa pagkaka-titig n'ya sa akin sa kabila ng pagtitig ko sa kanya na may halong pagka-bwisit at inis. isang kakila-kilabot na ngiti ang sumilaw sa mga labi nito habang naka-titig sa parteng bukong-bukong ng aking mga paa at dahan-dahan itong bumalik sa kanyang monitor. inisip ko kung anong magiging reaksyon n'ya kapag tinitigan ko rin ng kaparehong paraan ng pagtitig n'ya sa akin ang tinitigyawat n'yang leeg. parehong reaksyon pa rin ang nakuha ko habang naglalakad ako pabalik sa aking mesa kasama ang box ng computer wipes sa mga kamay ko. may maganda ring nangyari sa araw na iyon. habang nililinis ko ang mga drawer ng mesa ko ay may nakita akong half-used notebook mula sa nakaraang nagta-trabaho sa mesa ko. hindi n'ya nilagay ang first name n'ya, kundi initial lang at last name: j. espiritu. pero, base sa dekorasyon ng notebook, sigurado ako na babae rin s'ya kagaya ko. ang mga naiwan n'yang gamit ay nagbigay ng kapanatagan sa akin, pero 'yung notebook ang talagang pumukaw ng atensyon ko. doon ay sinabi nito ang pina-ikli at simpleng manual gamit ang easy-to-undertand terms at mga explenasyon sa nakaka-litong terminolohiya at komplikadong panuto sa manual. sa tulong n'ya ay nasurpresa ko ang aking manager sa aking product knowledge pagkatapos ng shift ko. matapos ang isang magandang araw ay buong tapang akong gumala sa office at nag-explore sa pantry. binenta ni andrew sa akin ang top-notch coffee machine at snacks sa nasabing pantry, tutal nagugutom na rin naman ako matapos ang isang emotionally, intellectually and productive na araw na 'yun. (ansabe). tsaka, medyo butas na rin 'yung bulsa at namumula na ang mga credit cards ko, kaya naman ayos na ako sa ilang pirasong masasarap na cookies. habang papalapit ako ay may narinig akong malakas na usapan at tawanan sa pantry. sa katangahan ko ay inisip ko na baka naman mas mainit, friendly o kahit maka-tao na sila sa akin. subalit ang maliit na pantry ay napuno ng katahimikan the moment na pumasok ako sa pantry. may limang lalaki doon na mag-kakaiba ang edad at lalaki na naka-upo sa palibot ng isang maliit na lamesa, at lahat sila ay naka-titig na direkta sa akin. ""panget na araw?"" - tugon ng isang pang-asar na boses. agad kong itinaas ang ulo ko mula sa pagkaka-titig sa sahig para hanapin ang pinag-mulan ng boses. hindi naging mahirap sa aking hanapin at malaman na mula iyon sa naka-hoodie na walang-hiyang tumitig sa akin nung nakaraan lang. ""siguro marami ka ng experience?"" - sambit pa nito sa nakaka-asar na tono at may-unting pag-taas ng kilay. ""para makakuha ng komportableng trabaho. siguro sikat ka?"". ""ano 'to, high-school?"" - sagot ko sa malakas na boses. hindi ko hilig kumompronta ng tao, pero sobra na 'to. hostility is one thing, social awkwardness is another, pero pakiramdam ko isa 'tong 80's na high-school drama na mga trenta anyos ang mga bida bilang mga teenagers. ""nandito lang ako para kumuha kape at kung may problema ka sa trabaho ko, puwede mong dalhin sa hr kung ano man ang issue mo"". nagpatuloy ako habang ine-enjoy ang namumutla at pahiyang mukha ng mga taong 'yun. mabuti naman, gusto kong maramdaman nila ang katiting na discomfort na buong araw kung kinakaharap. pinili kong lumayo sa aking mga co-workers, naglakad ako ng taas noo pabalik sa mesa ko na may hawak-hawak na tasa ng kape. bago pa ako maka-upo at enjoyin ang masarap na kape, napansin kong may isang mensahe galing sa hindi kilalang number: ""you have quite an attitude, don't you?"" nanigas ako habang hawak ang cell phone sa isa kong kamay at kape sa kabila. habang prino-proseso ko ang tila breach sa personal security ko, naka-tanggap ulit ako ng dalawa pang mensahe. isa ay ang hubo't-hubad kong katawan na sinend ko sa una kong serious college boyfriend. ang pangalawa: ""bakit hindi mo ngayon ibigay 'yang picture sa hr?"" sa totoo lang, sobrang naapektuhan ako sa invasion ng privacy ko. pumasok ang kahihiyan sa akin at sobrang naiinis ako for drawing so much unwanted attention sa sarili ko. kasalanan ko lahat 'to. pumasok ako sa isang office na puno ng ethical hackers na may pare-parehong pangalan ng aso bilang password. walang duda na ang litratong iyon ay umiikot na sa buong office at lahat ng iyon ay salamat sa walang hiyang ka-trabaho ko, at isa na akong kakatuwang tao sa loob ng office. hindi ko na ginalaw ang kape ko at umuwi na lang, habang pinipigilan ko ang bawat emosyon na bumuhos hanggang makarating ako sa safety ng bahay. halos hindi ako matigil sa kaiiyak nung gabing 'yun, iniisip ko na ang mga mukha ng mga ka-trabaho ko habang tigang na tigang na nakatitig sa hubad kong katawan. mga alas tres na ng madaling araw, doon ko lang na-realize na wala ng kwenta para pa magpaka-lunod ako sa kahihiyan. kailangan kong gumawa ng plano para maka-survive sa ganitong uri ng workplace. quitting is not an option kasi masyadong malaki ang pasweldo nila para tumigil ako. tsaka, halos tinapay na lang ang kaya kong bilhin sa araw-araw. ang pangalawa kong option ay pumunta sa hr, but there's no way i was going to open that can of worms. hindi ko mapapatunayan kong sino talaga ang nag-send ng mga mensahe na iyon. last option? stick with it, keep my head down, gawin ang trabaho na pinasukan ko at 'wag pansinin ang iba pang mga harassment na gagawin nila. 'yun nga ang ginawa ko. sa kabuuan ng isang linggong training ko ay pumapasok ako on time, hindi ako umaalis sa desk ko liban na lang kung pupunta sa palikuran. iniwasan ko rin ang kahit anong contact kanino man at pinanatili ko lang ang aking mga mata sa mga inanimate objects. salamat kay j. espiritu, palagi akong on top ng training ko. sa bawat bagong task na galing sa manager ko, laging may katumbas na entry sa kanyang notebook. wala ng nakaka-gagong texts at face-to-face na kumprontasyon, pero mayroong kakatuwang pakiramdam na panibagong sisira sa kalagayan ko. sa darating na biyernes na ang huling training ko, na nagdala sa akin sa huling entry sa notebook. night shift survival guide: - matulog sa buong umaga bago ang shift at 'wag na 'wag kang matutulog. - walang sino man ang dapat maka-pasok. - panatilihing may pepper spray na dala. (sa kahit anong sitwasyon). - i-check ang bawat aisle, meeting rooms. huwag kalimutang i-check ang ilalim ng lamesa, balkonahe, kitchen tables at kahit likod ng cooler. - laging mag-open ng skype na naka-ready sa emergency in case na hindi gumana ang mobile services. - panatilihing updated sa kaibigan/pamilya/lover kada oras. ang nasabing listahan ay medyo may kahulugan. una, sabi ng hr puwede naman akong matulog sa pagitan ng 2-5 am, basta malapit palagi sa akin ang office smartphone. mayroon nga silang pull out couch sa isang conference room para lang talaga sa ganitong sitwasyon. pangalawa, ang buong shift ay phone calls, kaya palaging may paraan para maka-tawag mula sa office phone, tama? lastly, ang mga naka-outlined sa ""guide"" ay parang o.a at paranoid. siguro 'yung listahan ay satirical? (ewan ko). siguro si espiritu parehas kami ng pakiramdam tungkol sa mga tila patay gutom na mga asong cold-blooded na co-workers? pero 'yung isip ko nag-tatrabaho ng sobra-sobra para makita ang logic sa likod ng mga pag-iingat na ito. may kakatuwa akong pakiramdam na may importanteng impormasyon akong hindi nalalaman. lahat 'yun iniisip ko habang paalis ako ng bahay nung biyernes na 'yun, last day ng training ko. ""andrew"", - dahan-dahan akong lumapit sa kanya. ""puwede ba mag-tanong?"" ""sure thing"", - sagot n'ya na may maaliwalas na ngiti sa kanyang mga labi. ""nagtataka lang ako, bakit wala akong nakikitang ibang support agents. i mean, 'di ba dapat merong at least lima pang tao para ma-cover 'yung six-day rotation cycle?"" ""kailangan mong tanungin ang manager mo tungkol d'yan. most likely naka-kalat sila sa iba pang branch sa syudad. normal lang naman 'yun sa ganoong kaso"", - sagot n'ya. pakiramdam ko tapos na kami sa diskusyon na 'yun matapos s'yang bumalik sa final tasks n'ya para sa linggong iyon. ""meron bang ibang agent na nag-trabaho dito liban sa akin?"" - pagpapatuloy ko, dahil ganun na lamang ang kagustuhan kong malaman ang iba pang detalye sa babaeng nag-fill out ng notebook na s'ya namang ginagamit ko sa buong linggong iyon. ""oo, may isang babae na humawak sa posisyon mo ng panandalian"", - ani ni andrew, habang naka-titig pa rin sa screen ng kanyang screen. pero napansin kong tumigil na s'ya sa pag-tatype o pag-galaw ng mouse. wari ko ay naka-titig lang s'ya sa iisang spot sa monitor n'ya. ""andrew"", - nag-salubong ang mga kilay ko. ""sino 'yung nag-trabaho malapit sa main working space na talagang nakaka-inis? maputla, medyo payat, maitim at kulot na buhok?"" - tanong ko, habang nagpapaikot ng daliri sa bandang ulunan ko para i-describe ang pagkaka-kulot ng nasabing lalake. ""ah... si michael"", - sagot nito, napansin nito ang pagiging iritable ng boses ko. ""may problema ba? ginugulo ka ba n'ya?"" ""hindi"" - sagot ko, pero sa isip-isip ko ay nagtatalo na ang emosyon at sarili ko. ""have a good weekend, andrew"" ""ikaw din"", - sagot nito, halata na may pagtataka sa boses nito habang papaalis ako. sa buong weekend na 'yun ay binabalik-balikan ko ang mga nangyari sa akin sa unang linggo ko. pakiramdam ko may hindi sinasabi si andrew sa akin na importante. wala namang rason para maging iretable s'ya nung nabanggit ko 'yung babaeng nag-trabaho bago ako. may nag-reklamo na kaya kay michael dati? pu-puwede kayang si j. espiritu? si michael ba ang dahilan ng survival guide sa notebook? bakit s'ya umalis? napaka-daming teorya ang bumagabag sa buong weekend ko. bago ko pa nalaman, oras na para bumalik sa trabaho. ito ang araw na talagang sobrang daming trabaho. kahapon ay lunes, ang unang regular day shift. mabilis lang dumaan ang nasabing araw, habang aligaga ako sa pag-sagot ng tawag, recording, sorting at assigning ng dose-dosenang customer complaints sa system namin. hindi sapat ang salitang nasanay na ako at pagkatapos ng araw na 'yun ay sobrang pagod at ubos na ako. saktong maglo-logout na ako, naka-tanggap na naman ako ng mensahe mula sa hindi kilalang number. ""ang sipag mo naman. hindi na ako makapag-hintay na mag night shift ka"" seryoso?! ito ang kauna-unahang mensahe na bumalot sa buong pagkatao ko ng takot. agad-agad kong ginala ang paningin ko kung nasa paligid ba si michael para kumprontahin ko s'ya sa pagse-send ng mensahe, pero kanina pa pala s'ya umalis. matapos kong pakalmahin ang sarili ko, umuwi na ako at sinusubukan kong hanapin si j. espiritu online. ang pinaka best bet ko noon ay sa linkedin, at doon nga ay sinusubukan kong galugarin ang buong listahan ng mga babae na may kinalaman sa proficient technologies na naka-lagay sa profile nila (halos kakaunti lang talaga sila). nung wala akong makita ay pumunta ako kay andrew at doon nga sa friend list n'ya ay sa wakas nakita ko na ang hinahanap ko. may babae na pangalan ay jennah espiritu at unemployed ang status. nag-send ako ng friend request na may mensahe na nag-papakilala at tinanong ko s'ya kung hinarass ba s'ya ng isa n'yang ka-trabaho. sa wakas, pakiramdam ko may patutunguhan na ako, natulog ako at inihanda ang sarili para sa bukas na event. naisip ko na baka may kakaibang mangyayari dahil sa pagbabago ng schedule nung natulog ako ng miyerkules. nag-check ako ng linkedin halos pagka-gising ko mga ala una. walang kahit anong sign kay jennah, kaya naman natulog ulit ako para makapag-handa sa night shift. medyo kinakabahan ako at excited at the same time kasi puwede ko ng mas malibot ang buong place of work ko intimately. dahil walang day crowd, malaya akong makaka-gala at ma-eenjoy ang cookies, dumura sa baso ni michael, kahit ano! may mga iilan pa ring mga nag-tatrabaho nung dumating ako para sa shift ko, pero hindi ko naman iyon pinansin at dahil sa nag-uumapaw na mga tawag at chats na aasikasuhin. makalipas ang dalawang oras, ang bugso ng mga tawag at chats pati mga tickets ay unti-unting bumagal hanggang tuluyan na nga itong tumigil ng sabay-sabay halos alas onse na ng gabi noon. sumandal ako sa kinauupuan ko at ginala-gala ang mga paningin sa aking workspace. wala ng tao noon sa office at least sa nakikita ko. naka-bukas ang lahat ng ilaw pero nung tinanggal ko ang headphones ko, may narinig akong mahinang jingling melody sa hindi kalayuan. para s'yang christmas carol, pero hirap akong tukuyin kong saan ito nangga-galing. wala namang dahilan para matakot ako sa pangyayari, pero pakiramdam ko ang mga nagtayuang balahibo sa mga kamay ko ay nagsilbing alarm. nang tumayo ako sa aking kinauupuan, nawala 'yung melody. well, naging paranoid na ako dati. minsan ko ng inisip na na may lalaking sumusunod sa akin isang gabi hanggang nilagpasan n'ya ako at nagtungo sa kalapit na tindahan sa 'di kalayuan. kahit mag-isa lang ako, lagi kong dino-double at triple check ang mga lock ng bahay bago matulog. aaminin ko na ang mga takot ko ay wala naman talagang basehan. mayroong naka-iwan ng headphones na konektado pa rin sa computer nito at naka-on ang music. o siguro may office party sa ibang kumpanya sa baba ng building. ang makarinig ng kanta ay nakaka-takot lamang sa mga kakatuwang horror movies, 'di ba? 'di ba?! para maka-siguro, hinalughog ko ang office para maka-siguro na mag-isa na nga lang ako. habang naglalakad sa gitna ng mga magkaka-dikit na desks, naisip ko kung gaano ako ka-swerte na mayroon akong sariling corner spot. hindi ko siguro kakayanin na mapalapit sa kahit sinong mga hindi kaaya-aya kong mga co-workers. matapos ko ma-check ang bawat rows ay dumiretcho ako sa front desk area at nagmamasid sa mga kagamitan ni andrew sa paghahanap ng clues. nung wala akong makitang clues ay bumalik ako sa main room ng pantry. unti-unti ng mas nagiging relaxed ang mga senses ko at tsaka ko lang napag-tanto na napasarap ata ang taste-testing ko sa mga cookies sa halip na mag-hanap ng mga kahina-hinalang mga bagay. kailangan ko ng tumigil sa kaka-kain ng cookies, pero dahil bumalik na naman ang kaninang tunog na naririnig ko, mas malakas s'ya ngayon. at the same time, ang work smartphone ko (na kinakailangan dala-dala namin kung aalis kami sa aming work station) tumunog at may mensahe mula sa hindi na namang kilalang number. so, nag-eenjoy ka ba sa cookies, ha? nanigas ang buong katawan ko habang prino-proseso ng utak ko ang mga pangyayari. siguro hindi talaga umalis ng office si michael at ngayon tinatakot ako. kinalikot ko ang tenga ko noon at nakinig ng maigi. walang kahit sino sa pantry as least sa nakikita at naririnig ko. tsaka, kung si michael ay nasa main workspace, hindi naman ganun kahirap na hulaan o sabihin na kumakain ako ng cookies. habang dahan-dahan akong humihinga, hindi ko muna pinansin ang tunog at nakinig ako ng maigi kung may iba pa akong tunog na maririnig. wala. dahan-dahan, naglakad ako sa may pantry drawers at doon may nakita akong malaking kutsilyo. alam ko bang gumamit ng kutsilyo? hindi. kaya ko kayang paalisin kung sino man ang unarmed na kalaban? syempre. papunta na sana ako pabalik sa aking work station ng biglang may tawag na pumasok mula sa work phone. ipinosisyon ko ang sarili ko ng kumportable sa pader ng pantry, kutsilyo sa kanang kamay, cell phone sa kabila, bago pa ako maka-sagot with the standard customer support greeting. nag static na sa kabilang linya at iba pang ingay sunod ang tuluyang pagka-putol ng linya at katahimikan. nung tinignan ko ang cell phone, nakita kong naka-patay na ito. sinubukan kong buksan ulit ito, pero hindi na ito gumagana. ok, ngayon kailangan ko ng bumalik sa computer ko in case na may pumasok pang mga tawag. naalala ko bigla ang isa sa mga guide na galing kay jennah habang isinusuksok ko ang walang kwentang cell phone sa bulsa ko. - laging mag-open ng skype na naka-ready sa emergency in case na hindi gumana ang mobile services. nangyari rin kaya 'to sa kanya? ang mga instructions sa notebook ay unti-unti ng nagkaroon ng kahulugan, at minumura ko ang sarili ko dahil sa pagiging tanga. sa oras na lumabas ang mga salita sa bibig ko ay may isa na namang mensahe ang dumating sa cell phone. kinuha ko iyon at sinubukang i-unlock, pero 'yung regular home screen ay hindi lumalabas. ang lumabas lang ay isang white screen na may maikling text. putang ina. ang mga babae dapat hindi ginagamit ng ganung mga uri ng salita. matapos kong mabasa 'yun ay nawala na ito sa screen at may panibagong text ang lumabas. bakit hindi ka lumabas at makipag-laro? huwag mo ng isiping bitbitin pa 'yang kutsilyong hawak mo. wala ring magagawa 'yan sa hawak kong baril. tinapon ko ang cell phone ko sa lapag at agad-agad ay nagtungo ako sa aking computer. ang tunog ay mas lalong lumakas habang papalapit ako sa aking lamesa, doon ay nakita kong may isang baboy na stuffed toy. may fabric button ito sa bandang paanan at music note na kasama. dito nagmumula ang tunog at nagpapatunay lamang na hindi ako mag-isa at may kung sino akong kasama. ang malala pa, pinapanood nila ang bawat galaw ko at sinusubukang takutin gamit ang mga laruang pambata. unti-unti ng dumadaloy ang pagpapanic sa aking buong katawan at naghahanda na sa fight or flight scenario. huminga ako ng malalim, sinusubukan kong pakalmahin ang buong katawan ko. so far wala pa naman akong naririnig ng kahit anong palatandaan na may ibang tao sa loob ng office. may mga background noises galing sa syudad sa labas at ang mga ingay mula sa naka-limutang patayin na computer ng isang employee. kung sino man ang gumagawa nito sa akin, kailangan kong malaman ang kanilang eksaktong lokasyon para maplano ko ng maayos ang pag-takas ko. isa pa, kailangan kong maka-kuha ng tulong sa lalong mas madaling panahon. habang iginigilid ko ang laruan ay umupo na ako sa aking upuan at pinull-up ang skype for business application. mabilis akong nag-dial ng 911, habang naka-loudspeaker ang telepono. tumunog na nga ang dial tone at agad-agad ay may live operator na sa kabilang linya. ibibigay ko na sana ang mga hindi kanais-nais na pangyayari sa akin ng mga oras na iyon ng may biglang humawak sa bukong-bukong ko mula sa ilalim ng lamesa. halos maubos ang buong lakas ko sa pagsigaw habang nagpu-pumiglas ang mga paa at mabilis na tumakbo sa abot ng aking makakaya sa bilis na hindi ko akaling kaya ko. may narinig akong kung anong kumusyon sa aking likuran habang tumakbo, kasunod ng isang malakas ng putok, na inisip ko na lamang na galing sa kung ano o sino man ang humahabol sa akin. bago ko pa malaman ay halos nasa ground floor na ako papunta sa pinto lagpas sa gwardiya na halatang nagulat sa mga nangyayari. ang malamig na hangin ay mabilis na pumasok sa manipis kong sweater habang papalapit ako sa isang malapit na pedestrian para humingi ng tulong. tumawag sila ng 911 at ang mga pulis ay agad namang dumating wala pang sampung minuto. habang naghihintay ako kasama ang gwardiya para sa kanilang pag-dating, hindi maalis sa isip ko ang sinulat ni jennah na warning, at kung gaano ako ka-tanga para ipagsa walang bahala ang mga ito. - i-check ang ang bawat aisle, meeting room. huwag kalimutang i-check ang ilalim ng lamesa, balkonahe, kitchen tables at kahit likod ng cooler. agad-agad namang sinulat ng pulis ang mga nangyari sa akin at iniwan ako kasama ang isang pulis officer, umakyat s'ya para i-check ang office. wala namang naka-labas-masok sa building mula nung tumakbo ako palabas, kaya malaki ang posibilidad na naroroon pa rin ang salarin at nagtatago sa loob. sa pag-iisip ay halos bumaliktad ang buong sikmura ko at mas lalo akong lumapit sa may armas kong kasama. maya-maya pa matapos kaming iwanan ng mga pulis, ang kasama kong pulis ay nag-radyo at isa-isa may mga boses na nagpapa-palit-palit sa radyo na humingi ng backup at nga mga codes na hindi ko maintindihan. mabilis na nag-escalate ang mga sumunod na pangyayari. imbis na pauwi ay dinala nila ako sa police station at doon ay nanatili ako sa isang interrogation room ng halos 2 oras bago pa sa wakas may dalawang pulis officer ang kumausap sa akin. pagod na ako noon, miserable ang kalagayan at higit sa lahat litong-lito sa kung papaano naganap ang mga pangyayari. gusto ko ng umuwi pero nanatili pa ako ng ilang oras para i-kuwento ang mga pangyayari sa dalawang pulis officer. 'ahh... meron kang kutsilyong hawak habang tumakbo ka galing sa pantry papunta sa lamesa mo? sigurado ka ba?' tanong ng isang nakaka-tandang officer na nagpakilala bilang senior investigator manlapig. 'ah. ah... oo.' pautal-utal kong sagot sa kanya. 'naniniwala akong meron. nag-papanic na ako noon, kaya mahirap sabihin. tapos may baboy na stuffed toy, ' sabi ko, habang tila baga'y nawawalan ako ng abilidad na mag-isip ng tama. 'at naniniwala ka na ang taong humaharass sa'yo ay si michael villareal?' sabi ng isa pang officer, hindi ko maalala 'yung pangalan n'ya. wala s'yang badge. 'hindi ko alam buong pangalan n'ya, pero wala na akong ibang kilala na iba pang responsable.' 'at sa huling pagkakataon, just for the record, anong nangyari matapos mong mag-dial ng 911?' tanong ni manlapig sa ika-apat na pagkakataon sa gabing 'yun. 'may kung sino ang humawak sa binti ko. bukong-bukong, actually. nangyari 'yun bago pa ako magkaroon ng pagkakataong ipaliwanag ang sitwasyon sa operator. nagsusumigaw at piglas ang mga paa ko tapos tumakbo hanggang may makita akong tao sa labas na pina-tawag ako sa 911 para sa tulong.' sagot ko, habang pagod na pagod sa paulit-ulit at paikot-ikot na pagtatanong. 'si michael villareal ay natagpuang patay sa hindi kalayuan ng iyong lamesa nung pumunta ang officer namin sa pinang-yarihan ng insidente. nakita mo ba ang kanyang katawan nung tumakbo ka palabas ng office?' tanong ng isang officer. halos malaglag ang panga ko sa mga narinig ko at tumitig sa dalawang pulis habang balisa at nanginginig sa takot. 'hi.. hi.. hindi,' pabulong akong nag-salita, 'hindi ko maintindihan,' 'sinaksak s'ya hanggang sa mamatay gamit ang malaking kutsilyo. ang katawan n'ya ay balot ng dalawampu't-tatlong saksak,' paliwanag ni manlapig. 'at nakita namin ang kutsilyo ay nakabaon sa bibig nito, dahilan para dumikit ito sa sahig diretcho sa lalamunan,' 'may rason kami para pagsuspetyahan na ito rin ang sinasabi mong kutsilyo,' dagdag pa ng pangalawang officer. nakatitig ako sa dalawang pulis officer ng tahimik, hirap akong intindihin ang mga pangyayari lalo na't ang utak ko ay halos mawala na sa ulirat. 'ang mga sinabi mo ay nagpapatunay lamang sa mga natagpuaan namin sa cell phone ni michael villareal. nalaman namin na may roon siyang hacking apps,' pagpapatuloy ng senior officer. 'natagpuan din naman ang ilan mo pang mga hubong larawan at ang mga mensahe na iyong nabanggit. mayroon s'yang baril at nakita rin naman ang basyo ng bala nung binaril ka n'ya habang papatakas ka.' 'ang hindi namin maintindihan ay kung papaano s'ya namatay.' dagdag pa ng pangalawang officer, halatang hindi s'ya naniniwala sa aking reaksyon. 'ok lang kung napatay mo s'ya dahil sa self-defense, aya. may balak s'yang masama sa'yo.' 'hindi,' pautal-utal kong sagot. 'pangako, wala akong ideya... oh, oh my god.' naiyak na ako dahil sa mga nangyayari. 'ibig kong sabihin, nung nakaraang buwan lang may nag-report sa kanya galing sa isa n'yang co-worker,' sabi ni manlapig. 'jennah,' bulong ko. 'kilala mo si miss espiritu?' tanong ng pangalawang officer, at ng suspetya sa kanyang mga mats. 'hindi,' ako ang pumalit sa lamesa n'ya at nakuha ko ang notebook n'ya. dapat sinabi ko na 'to kanina pa. anong sabi sa report? doon nga ay nagtitigan ang dalawang pulis at maka-lipas ang ilang sandali ay inilatag at ipinaliwanag ni manlapig ang mga hindi magandang nangyari kay jennah na halos mangyari na sa akin. si jennah espiritu ay dumiretcho sa pinaka-malapit na hospital mula sa kanyang unang night shift tatlong buwan na ang nakakaraan. sobrang bugbog ng katawan n'ya at sugatan, at gustong mag-file ng anonymous rape kit. ang natanong damage n'ya sa kanyang puwerta ay sobrang severe na kinailangan n'yang sumailalim sa operasyon at magpatahi. nag-file s'ya ng police report makalipas ang dalawang buwan matapos s'yang hindi pumasa sa probationary period sa inyong kumpanya, ng nawala s'ya sa trabaho (ang nagiisang paraan para mabayaran ang kanyang utang sa hospital). ang nangyari ay ang kanyang aligasyon kontra kay michael villareal, na gumastos s'ya ng malaki sama mo pa ang hindi mabilang na kanyang mga co-workers na kumontra sa kanya laban sa magalang at kaaya-ayang katangian ni michael. 'pero kahapon lang ay iniurong na n'ya lahat ng mga isinampa n'yang kaso kay michael,' sabi ng walang badge na pulis. 'kasalukuyan naming inaalam ang kinaroroonan ni espiritu para ma-interview namin s'ya. sigurado ako na ngayon malinaw na kung bakit may suspetya kami sa iyo bilang nakikilala mo espiritu.' nagpatuloy ang mga tanong ng dalawang pulis hanggang may isang lalaki na nag-abot sa kanya ng isang sobre. natukoy na ng forensics ang fingerprint na nakita sa kutsilyo at ang blood-spatter patterns. kinailangan ko ring mag-submit ng dna samples para maka-tulong sa imbestigasyon at sa wakas ay pina-uwi na nila ako. sa bahay, dahil sa sobrang pagod, hindi ako maka-tulog. wala akong gamit na naiuwi. bag, cell phone at kahit ang jacket ko ay kinailangan i-submit bilang ebidensya. kaya naman napilitan akong gamitin ang luma kong laptop, umaasa na malibang sa internet. ang browser ko ay naka-login pa rin sa linkedin account ko mula sa nakaraang login, at nirefreshed ko ang page bilang naka-sanayan. isang maliit na red icon ang lumitaw na mayroon akong bagong mensahe. jennah. nagre-reply na s'ya sa akin. don't worry, sis. i took care of it. ❤️",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/t77k69/tagalized_story/,5 03 2022

Tagalized - Morgue.,"may nakita akong isang ad sa dyaryo, hindi man ako maka-paniwala at kinilabutan pero nakaka-anyaya ang sinasabi. ""gusto mo bang kumita ng 1000 pesos per night bilang security sa morge? apply na!"" medyo matagal na rin akong walang trabaho at makaka-bayad na rin ako ng upa at makapa-mamumuhay ng maginhawa kung magkataon. kaya naman nag-apply ako kahit medyo nag-dalawang-isip, inaasahan ko nang hindi ako makaka-kuha ng kahit anong sagot mula sa kumpanya. pero wala pang dalawang oras ay may natanggap akong email mula sa employer: ""maraming salamat sa ipinasa mong application form para sa posisyong night guard sa morge. masaya kong ibinabalita na ang mga skills na iyong binanggit ay tugma para sa hinahanap namin sa isang guard at gusto kitang offeran ng isang taong kontrata. kung ika'y sumasang-ayon sa mga kasunduan sa ibaba, maari lamang mag-iwan ka ng signature online via e-signature na naka-lista sa baba at pumunta ka sa (redacted) eksakto alas diyes ngayong gabi. makaka-tanggap ka ng 5000 linggo-linggo na direkta sa iyong bangko."" ngayong gabi? hindi ba masaydong mabilis ang mga pangyayari? pero hindi na ako nag-reklamo o tanong pa. hindi ko alam kung anong aasahan o kung sino ang madadatnan ko doon, kaya sinuot ko na 'yung damit at pantalon ko at agad nagtungo sa nasabing address nang mas maaga sa itinakdang oras. nandoon na ako ng mga alas nwebe kwarenta 'y singko ng gabi at may isang middle aged na lalaki na mukhang nag-tatrabaho sa morge ang bumati sa akin. ""hi, michael, tama? ako nga pala si james."" - doon ay nag-kamayan kami at nag-kangitian - ""alam ko na pinapunta ka dito sa kabila ng maikling abiso, pero sadyang nanganga-ilangan ng bagong gwardiya ang kumpanya na nag-hire sa atin dito agad-agad para ngayong gabi."" ""edi padala ako mula sa security company sa morge n'yo?"" - tanong ko. ""tama ka. nagta-trabaho ka sa isang outsourcing security company at sa alam ko, malaki sila mag-bayad. malay mo, mas maging mataas pa ang posisyon mo sa hinaharap."" - sabay kindat. ""ok. ano naman ang mga trabaho ko dito..."" pagsisimula ko. ""ahh, 'yun. wala naman gaano, siguraduhin mo lang na walang makakapasok."" - lumapit s'ya sa akin at sinabing - ""o labas."" isang maikling katahimikan at nagtinginan kaming dalawa, doon ay napa-ngiti ito at ang sabi: ""de, joke lang. so ayun, tapos na 'yung shift ko, kaya naman mauuna na ako. basta doon ka lang sa office at mag-relax hanggang alas sais ng umaga. doon darating na 'yung kahalili mo."" at doon nga ay umalis na s'ya. umupo ako sa upuan sa may office. akala ko siguro naman walang hindi magandang mangyayari. may papel sa harap ko at habang tinitignan ko ito ay doon ko lang napagtanto na ito ay listahan ng mga rules na specifically naka-asign sa akin. ito ang sabi: sa bagong gwardiya. welcome to the company. sa baba ay ang listahan ng mga rules para sa iyong trabaho: 1. ang una mong dapat gawin ay ang mag-conduct ng full sweep sa buong area para siguraduhin na walang kakaibang mga nangyayari liban sa ordinary (pati sa crypt). important note: kung may katawan man na naka-labas sa chambers sa loob ng crypt, itulak mo lamang ito pabalik. dapat manatili silang nasa-loob sa lahat ng pagkakataon. 2. matapos ang buong sweep, maari ka nang manatili sa loob ng office hanggang matapos ang shift mo. may iba pang mga rules na naka-lista sa baba, pero nag-desisyon akong libutin muna ang buong lugar. medyo may kaliitan ang morge, may isang malaking medical room na halos mapuno ng medical supplies ang loob. pero may sapat na espasyo para sa 2-3 lamesa na puwedeng pag-lagyan ng mga labi. sa loob ng crypt ay may palikuran. nag-desisyon akong unahin na ang pinaka-ayaw kong lugar - 'yung crypt. umalis na ako sa office at binuksan ang solid at napaka-bigat na pinto ng crypt, agad-agad ay sinalubong ako ng napaka-lamig na hangin. sa loob, may dalawang katawan sa gitna ng kwarto at mga chambers sa pader. lahat naman sila ay sarado kaya naman mabilis akong lumabas ng kwarto. habang pabalik ako mula sa bathroom, may nakita akong lalaki na naka lab coat na naka-tayo sa gitna ng medical room. parang may kinakalikot gamit ang mga medical tools malapit sa isang body bag. ""tang... tinakot mo naman ako boss."" - sabi ko. tinignan n'ya ako na parang wala lang at bumalik sa ginagawa nito. ""akala ko umuwi na ang lahat. ako nga pala si michael, bagong gwardiya."" - sabi ko, gaya ng nauna, hindi n'ya ako pinansin. kumaway na ako at umalis pabalik ng office. babasahin ko na sana ulit ang mga rules ng biglang may matinis na tunog akong narinig na para bang may bakal na kumi-kiskis sa isa pang bakal na nag-eecho sa buong building. medyo mahina na ito at parang nang-gagaling sa mga tubo. tumagal din iyon ng ilang segundo at huminto sa kaparehas na segundo. hindi ko na lang pinansin at i-idlip na lang, check ng cell phone. pero medyo tumatagal na ang tunog at habang mas kinikilabutan ako ay unti-unti nang nagbabago ang kanina'y parang bakal na kumi-kiskis sa isa't-isa ay naging... ungol. lumabas ako ng office at tatanungin ko sana 'yung kaninang naka lab coat pero mukhang naka-uwi na s'ya sa mga oras na 'yun. hindi ako sigurado kung saan mismo nang-gagaling ang tunog, pero parang sa may crypt, kaya naman pinuntahan ko ito. 'yung oras na binuksan ko ang pinto ay ang buong building ay nanahimik. huminga ako ng malalim at napansin ko na 'yung isang chambers ay naka-bukas na ng bahagya. tinulak ko ito pabalik at agad-agad na bumalik sa office. nawala na ng tuluyan ang matinis na na para bang ungol na iyon. nagpatuloy ako sa pagbabasa: 3. maari kang matulog sa office, pero dapat handa ka sa mga mangyayari. sleep at your own risk, ika nga nila. matapos nun ay isang napaka-lakas na tunog ang halos mag-patalon sa buong pagkatao ko. ""tulong! palabasin n'yo ako dito!"" - ang boses ay tila nang-gagaling sa mga tubo. tumayo ako habang sobra ang kalabog ng dibdib ko. ""palabasin n'yo ako, hindi ako maka-hinga!"" - paulit-ulit na pagmama-kaawa ng boses na ngayon ay may kasama ng kalabog. binuksan ko ang pintuan ng office at sa hindi malaman na dahilan sa crypt nang-gagaling ang boses. nanginginig, pero binuksan ko ang pinto. ""buhay pa ako, isa itong pagkakamali! tulong!"" - mas lalong lumakas ang boses nung oras na buksan ko ang napaka-bigat at solidong pinto. ""asan ka?!"" - nanginginig akong tumingin sa paligid, habang ang walang humpay na tumatawag ang boses na may kasamang malalakas na kalabog. lumapit ako at unti-unting inilapit ang tenga para maka-siguro na ang bubuksan ko ay ang tamang chamber. ""buhay pa ako! utang na loob! ple----"" ang boses at ang mga kalabog ay daglian na lamang nawala nang biglaan kong binuksan ang isa sa mga chambers at sinalubong ako ng malamig na bangkay ng isang middle-aged na lalaki. tumayo lang ako doon, nakatitig sa bangkay, halos tumigil sa pagtakbo ang isip ko sa kung ano ang mga nangyayari. malinaw na malinaw kong narinig at naramdaman ko ang bawat kalabog nung oras na hinawakan ko ang hawakan ng chamber at para bang may kung sino man na bigla-bigla na lang nagpatigil nito. pinaglalaruan lang ba ako ng aking isipan? tinulak ko ang chamber pabalik at mabilis na umalis doon, nilock ang pinto ng office. iniisip ko na ang pag-aaply sa trabahong 'to ay maaring isang malaking pagkakamali. pakiramdam ko na nababaliw na ako, pero agad ko ring kinumbinse ang sarili ko na nasa ulo ko lang lahat ng 'to. nagpatuloy ako sa pagbabasa ng mg rules: 4. puwede kang mag-patugtog para maibsan ang katahimikan basta't hindi ito makaka-kuha ng atensyon sa labas. 5. kung may marinig kang hindi mo maipaliwanag na ingay galing sa may crypt, 'wag mo na lamang ito pansinin. 6. kung ang mga ingay na 'yun ay naging sigaw ng pagpapanic, gawin ang mga sumusunod: • kung ang mga sigaw ay mula sa babae, 'wag mo pansinin hanggang sa tumigil ito. 'wag na 'wag kang papasok sa loob ng crypt sa mga oras na nangyayari ito sa kahit anong dahilan. • kung ang mga ingay ay mula sa lalaki, hanapin ang pinag-mumulan ng ingay at hatakin ang chamber. dapat huminto na ang ingay pagkatapos mong mabuksan ang chamber. doon na nagtatapos ang page. nilapag ko na ang papel at dahan-dahang inilapat ang likod ko sa upuan. ala una na noon at nag-sisimula na akong antukin. maya-maya pa ay nagsisimula ng pumikit ang aking mga mata ng kusa. nagsisimula na akong mahulog sa panaginip nang biglang may mahigpit akong hawak na naramdaman sa likod ng aking balikat. sa sobrang gulat ko ay agad-agad akong napatayo at sinipa ang upuan. walang tao o kahit ano noong mga oras na iyon. hindi na ako inaantok nung mga oras na 'yun. tahimik na ang buong kapaligiran noon at nagpunta ako sa palikuran. pagbalik ko ay alas tres na at halos handa na akong tapusin ang shift ko dito. napagisip-isip ko na hindi na rin masama para sa isang libo, hanggang tinalikod ko ang papel na may mga rules at napansin kong may naka-sulat pa sa likod: 7. lahat ng staff ay lalabas o dapat nasa labas na ng building bago mag alas diyes ng gabi, kaya kung may makita kang lalaki na naka lab coat during your shift, 'wag na 'wag sa kahit ano mang sitwasyon na subukan mong makipag-usap sa kanya. paulit-ulit-ulit kong binasa ang rule ng limang beses, pero wala pa ring nagbabago sa naka-sulat. may mahinang katok sa pinto ng office. tinignan ko ito at sa likod ng salamin ay nakita ko ang lalaking naka lab coat naka-ngiti sa akin. alas kwatro 'y media na at patuloy pa rin s'ya sa pagkatok. sa mga magta-tanong, hindi ko na ho alam kung saan ko ito nakuha dahil 2018 ko pa po ito tinagalog. nakita ko lang na naka-save pa rin sa note ng selpon ko. salamat and ang init. tangina.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/t8j464/tagalized_morgue/,7 03 2022
Story time: Uninformed News Edition,"a friend showed me a tiktok video of a supposed influencer sharing his thoughts on covid. the video (with embedded texts) went like this: ""storytime: covid 19 edition and then dinala sa hospital, dead on arrival. then sabi nung doctor sa mga kamag anak. kung papayag yung family na ang ilagay sa death cert nung namatay ay covid instead of heart attack 😱😱. so yun lang, idk what to do with that information kaya skl."" let me answer you, what you should do with that information is ask someone who is knowledgeable on the topic or at least someone who knows more than you do, cause you definitely don't know a lot. what you should not do though is post a video putting the hospital and medical professionals in a malicious light. for those of you who wants to be educated on the topic: anyone who is symptomatic, we can't mix with those who do not have the symptoms. ubo, sipon, lagnat, hirap sa paghinga, pananakit ng kasukasuan, pagsusuka, pagtatae or pagkawala ng pang-amoy at panlasa. you might be wondering, eh ang daming sakit with the same symptoms. yes, kaya nga po puno ang emergency rooms and covid floors. unless proven na negative ka sa covid (with rt-pcr), it is prudent that we don't place you with those without the symptoms. hospital protocols also dictates that anyone who arrives dead will be tagged as covid suspect (relating to the tiktok vid, paano nasabing heart attack? may ckmb ka? may trop i ka? may ecg ka ba???). covid also complicates underlying conditions like heart, brain problems which might have led to the demise of the patient. did the patient die of a heart problem? possible. did the patient die of covid? possible. hindi sya exclusive, and unless we do post-mortem swab, we will not know. the government ideally should fund more research centers and laboratories, to make testing more available kahit sa maralita. sayang yung mga inutang. hindi lahat ng tao afford ang 2-5k na rt-pcr swab na may 7 days validity lang. pag may rt-pcr ka na timely ang collection, you need not be tagged as suspect and can be treated sa covid negative area, therefore decongesting the covid suspect area, therefore freeing some resources that can be used for those in critical conditions. i am all for freedom of expression, but i also believe in responsible posting. supposed ~influencers~ should help us eradicate misinformation, use their platform for greater good. you also address your audience well. isang taon na tayong lockdown, ang dami nang dinagdag na letra sa cq. baka naman po? if you have any questions, if in any way i can explain things in simpler terms. i also urge people in the medical field to answer people the simplest way possible, to be ""patola"" na. our job extends way outside the corners of the hospital. di na lang covid ang kalaban, bad governance, ignorance and misinformation too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/mgihgq/story_time_uninformed_news_edition/,30 03 2021

sample ng fake news na nakalat sa fb messenger,"bill gates, na napunta kay satanas at mga illuminati na microchip tas meron pang id 2020, e 2021 na.. kalungkot lang kasi kahit mismo mong mga kamaganak pa yung mga tumatangkilik sa mga fake news na ganito na nakalat sa messenger. karamihan jan sa mga kamag anak ko na bilib na bilib sa mga yan ay yung mga nasa probinsya, bat ba ganyan. kung ano pa yung fake news mas trip pa nila paniwalaan, kasi mas may thrill yang ganyang news? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ nagkabulgaran na 📷📷📷 scam ang covid... totoo ba ito? 📷📷📷 yung covid ay parang flu lang talaga yun bini brainwash tayo ng mga globalists na nakakatakot yun para macontrol nila ang buong mundo at iyan nga ang nangyayari ngayon. ang motibo nila ay pabagsakin ang economiya. then impose the new world order---one world government, one world religion, one world currency. they have began with the ""new normal"" which is abnormal. sa loob lamang ng mahigit isang buwan ay naganap ang gusto nilang mangyari: lockdown, ecq-gcq-ecq-gcq, social distancing, wearing of masks, etc. dahil hinihintay daw, within 18 months, ilalabas nila yung vaccine na lahat ay irerequire na magpaturok. yung vaccine na yun ay quantum dots. bakit 18 months? kasi 18=6+6+6 or 666, the mark of the beast. lahat ng matuturukan ay bibigyan ng id na ang tawag ay id2020 at isa pa, eventually, lalagyan ng microchips ang mga mababakunahan which can contain info of the person and will also be used for all transactions na gagawin niya. yung social distancing, sinasanay na ang tao para mas madaling mamonitor pag layu-layo through 5g technology. i might be wrong, pero ano pa ang maiisip natin? yung mask, kunwari for our protection pero in reality, it will suffocate the lungs. just imagine hindi ka makalanghap ng sariwang hangin. it makes us more susceptible to viruses. the globalists are really killing the people slowly. yung social distancing, pababagsakin ng todo ang ekonomiya dahil hindi makapag-full force work ang mga tao. yung sobrang lockdown ay pababagsakin din ang health natin, as explained by the doctors in the video. yung mga globalists ay kasama sila bill gates, rockefeller foundation, big pharma, dr. fauci, who, mga bayarang scientists, at yung iba pang super yaman sa mundo. kasama rin si pope, at ang china--the sleeping giant who is now slowly rising--the dragon in the bible. malapit na ang tribulation period kung mananagumpay ang plano ng mga ito. lahat ay nakalatag na. that is, if we allow these globalists to push through with their agenda, and if jesus christ will hastens his coming again. sa ating mananampalataya, walang problema dahil kung malapit na ang tribulation, mas malapit na ang pagparito ng pang.jesus. kaya tama ang ginagawa nating soul winning through celfone. pero kailangan din nating ipaalam sa mga tao ang balak ng mga globalists na ito. we have human rights na inalis sa loob lamang ng mahigit isang buwan. sana nga matauhan na ang mga mayor pataas hanggang kay president duterte gaya ng nangyari kay president trump at yung nagsalita sa video sa italy na nagsabing hindi naman talaga 25,000 ang namatay sa covid sa italy gaya ng nakatala sa covid count at ibinalita sa media. yan ang power ng mga bayarang media. according to present studies about covid patients, 99% of those who died ay may ibang sakit. yun namang na-test na may covid ay 88-90% sa kanila ay nakaka-recover at 10-12% lang ang namamatay. pag ikinumpara sa population ng buong mundo, napaka minimal ng death, 0.00 something lang in percentage. in other words, hindi talaga sya pandemic but plan demic. saka bakit puro covid cases na lang ang nirereport na cause of death. kasi doctors are being pressured to include covid as the cause of death. malaki pala ang incentive ng mga hospitals pag covid ang ikinamatay. pera-pera lang talaga. sana makatulong ang mga may katungkulan sa pagsisiwalat ng katotohanan. hwag nating pahintulututan na manatili tayong sunud-sunuran sa isang systema na ang diablo ang nananagumpay. iparating natin sa pamahalaan ang katotohanan habang may access pa tayo sa media. while it is true that we must obey government rules, we also have the responsibility to tell the people and government officials about the truth. let the people know the truth, may god bless us all. copy paste if you care godbless us all📷📷📷 ctto 27 minutes ago · sent from mobile bagong pasa po ito now lang, pls pass to inform lahat ng filipino. ""be aware huwag kayong maniwala dyan sa vaccine nayan. automatic na magpa- positive ka sa covid pag tinest kahit walang sakit. yan raw ang pinasa sa congress dito. malapit na nila ilabas ang vaccine ngayon na may microchip. huwag kayong magpapa- vaccine pag lumabas nayan dyan sa pinas, kasi ibang klaseng needles ang ginagamit tulad sa europe na my microchip. ipakalat at ipaalam nyo sa lahat ng mga kaanak nyo... hindi yan biro, itong virus ang way nila para ma implement ang microchip... yan ang makikita pag mag oopen ng website, ng us. nakakatakot yan pag napasa na. ... pwede na silang basta pumasok sa loob ng bahay mo, pag nag mandatory nayan... tiyak, magkakaroon ng war dito sa us. dahil maraming against sa mandatory. sa canada, sapilitang pumupunta sa bahay para pilitin ang mga tao na ma test ng covid. pag mangyari yan, lahat na bansa susunod na. may nag test na niyan dito gamit ang papaya fruit at nagka positive ang papaya sa covid. ito ang sinasabi na bawasan ang bilyon bilyong tao sa mundo. mga kampon sila ng diablo, lahat ng testing kits galing sa us, kaya ang mga tao di na naniwala sa numbers of covid. yung dr. fuchi na nagsabi na my vaccine na para sa covid, kasabwat siya ni bill gates. si bill gates ang punot dulo ng lahat ng virus nayan. pastor kasi siya sa illuminati, isang devil church. siya ang gumawa ng covid virus at dinala sa china at pag kumalat na sa buong mundo, siya na din ang maglalabas ng vaccine, panlaban sa virus. plano na nila yan lahat dahil ito ang nakasulat sa revelation. mostly, lahat na nga ng tao dito, may baril kaya pag mag mamandatory nayan dito sa us, war talaga ang mangyaryari. yung mga doctors mismo ang nagsabi na di maganda ang vaccine sa katawan dahil puro chemicals ang ingredients at my biochip. may mga videos na dinidelete na sa youtube, para hindi na mapanood ng mga tao. basahin nyo agad ito, bago nila burahin... dahil lahat ng information about sa gamot ng china virus, o sa plano ng ""who"" at ""doh"" ,at ng mga gobyerno... pinabubura agad nla."" pls forward...",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/nmlku1/sample_ng_fake_news_na_nakalat_sa_fb_messenger/,28 05 2021

madalas ko ngang kinukurot at sinasampal ang mukha ko para masiguradong hindi ako nananaginip. &#x200b; apat na taon na kami ng aking mahal na nobya. noong niligawan ko siya, lahat ng mga kaibigan at kapitbahay ko sinabihan ako na huwag ko na raw ituloy dahil bad news daw siya at mapapariwara lamang ako kapag naging kami. na may ""something"" daw ang pamilya nila sa probinsya. bagong lipat lang ako sa lugar na iyon at mag-a-anim na buwan pa lamang doon nang makilala ko ang nobya ko. hindi ako nakinig sa mga sinasabi nila, mga tsismoso at mga tsimosa, at itinuloy ang panliligaw. hindi nagtagal, sinagot din niya ako at talagang sobrang ligaya ko simula noon. lahat ng mga nagsabing mapapariwara raw ako, hindi ko na sila mga kaibigan ngayon. &#x200b; last year lang, nagsimula na kaming mag-live in. kumuha kami ng condo sa taguig at talagang sobrang saya namin. halos wala kaming problema, wala kaming anumang away. at siyempre, dahil iyon sa sinusunod ko ang mga special rules. &#x200b; well, wala naman talaga siyang special rules para sa akin. kung ano ang gusto at ayaw ng mga pangkaraniwang babae sa kanilang nobyo, ganoon din naman siya. sa totoo lang, mas maluwag pa siya sa ibang mga naging girlfriend ko dati. understanding siya, hindi demanding. kaya mahal na mahal ko siya! &#x200b; ang tinutukoy kong mga ""rules"" ay mga simpleng observations ko lamang sa kanya. mga bagay na hindi naman niya ipinagbabawal o dine-demand pero mas maganda kung alam mo. ito ang susi ng aming napakasaya at very smooth na relationship. hindi ba't may kasabihan tayo na, ""ang nagsasama nang matapat at sumusunod sa mga rules ng girlfriend niya, nagsasama nang maluwat."" &#x200b; heto ang mga simpleng rules kaya't perfect ang relationship namin ng aking perfect girlfriend. konti lang naman sila: &#x200b; rule #1. ayaw na ayaw ng girlfriend ko ang mga simbahan. hindi kasi siya religious at ang sabi niya, na-trauma raw siya dahil pinalaki siya ng kanyang lola na super relihiyosa. isa yatang panatiko ang lola niya na miyembro ng isang religious group sa probinsya nila na masasabing parang kulto na nga. kaya't kapag nakakakita siya ng mga churches (kahit anong religion), parang sumasama ang pakiramdam niya. isang beses nga, dumaan ako sa isang kalsada na hindi pamilyar sa akin. ang sabi kasi ng ka-opisina ko, shortcut daw iyon. kaya hindi ko alam na mayroon palang simbahang dadaanan. pagdaan na pagdaan ng kotse ko sa tapat ng simbahan, biglang nagtitili ang girlfriend ko. nagpupumiglas siya, parang nasasaktan ang buong katawan. grabeng trauma siguro ang sinapit niya sa kamay ng lola niya kaya ganoon ang reaksyon niya. kaya binilisan ko ang pagpapatakbo ng kotse ko hanggang sa makalayo kami roon. saka lamang siya huminahon. umiiyak siya, humihingi ng sorry. naiintindihan ko naman siya, wala siyang kasalanan. biktima lamang siya. hinaplos ko ang kanyang buhok at pinunasan ang kanyang mga luha. doon ko lang napansin na namumula ang kanyang noo at mga pisngi. pati mga braso niya ay namumula rin. nang pansinin ko ito, ang sabi niya ay baka nauntog siya o naihampas ang mga braso sa dashboard o sa bintana noong nagpupumiglas siya. niyaya ko siyang dalhin sa ospital pero tumanggi siya. sasabihin ko sanang imposibleng nauntog siya dahil hindi naman mukhang mga pasa ang nasa kanyang mukha at mga braso kundi mukha itong parang nasunog ngunit bigla siyang ngumiti, ang kanyang perpektong mga ngiti, kaya't nakumbisi na rin ako na okay na siya. pagkauwi namin, wala nang anumang bakas sa kanyang mukha na nauntog siya. &#x200b; kaya't kapag bumabiyahe kami, kailangang planuhin ang rutang dadaanan namin at siguraduhing hindi kami malalapit sa anumang simbahan. &#x200b; rule #2. hindi kumakain ng gulay ang girlfriend ko. siguro naman, marami sa inyo ganito ang mga girlfriend. mahilig sa meat pero ayaw kumain ng gulay. nakakatuwa, hindi ba? ako rin naman hindi masyadong mahilig sa gulay. kaya't kung kakain kami o lalabas, laging meat ang kinakain namin. hilig nga niya 'yung mga unli na barbecue. lalo na 'yung mayroong mga lamanloob. paboritong-paborito niya ang atay, intestines, puso, utak, at kung anu-ano pa. mahilig din siya sa dinuguan. minsan nga, isinama niya ako sa isang exclusive restaurant. mga members lang daw ang pwedeng kumain doon at miyembro siya at ang kanyang mga parents. nasa isang subdivision ito na puro mayayaman lamang ang nakatira. sa labas, mukha lang itong malaking mansyon pero pagpasok mo, isa pala itong restaurant. grabe, mayayaman talaga ang mga kumakain doon. may nakita pa nga akong mga artista at mga pulitiko. &#x200b; ang specialty ng restaurant na iyon ay mga lamanloob. tuwang-tuwa ang girlfriend ko nang orderin niya ang soup number 5. pinakain niya sa akin iyon at pinaubos dahil aphrodisiac daw iyon. masaya ko namang sinunod ito kahit na first time ko kumain noon. excited din ako dahil siguradong mapapalaban ako sa mangyayaring bakbakan pagkauwi namin. medyo natigilan lang ako noong una kong makita. ang alam ko kasi, ang main ingredient ng soup number 5 ay ari at bayag ng isang kalabaw. pero, noong pagsandok ko, parang iba ang nakita ko. parang iba ang hugis, parang malapit sa tao. pero siyempre, hindi ko na 'yun pinansin at siguradong imahinasyon ko lamang iyon. &#x200b; rule #3. hindi mahilig magpa-picture at mag-selfie ang aking girlfriend. ayaw na ayaw niya na kuhanan siya ng litrato, lalo na kung stolen. kaya nga kapag lumalabas kami, lagi siyang naka-cap at naka-long sleeves na jacket na may hoodie (ayaw niya rin kasi ang naaarawan). noong bago pa lamang kami, sinubukan ko siyang kuhanan ng picture nang palihim. pagtingin ko, nagtaka ako dahil parang deformed ang hitsura niya sa larawan. ni-restart ko ang phone ko at inulit pero ganoon pa rin. kaya tumabi ako sa kanya at mabilis na kumuha ng selfie. grabe ang galit niya sa akin! pinagsusuntok niya ako pero tinanggap ko ang lahat hanggang sa mawala ang galit niya. mga six months din bago ko nakita 'yung picture sa phone ko. inabot din kasi ng six months bago natanggal ang cast sa mga braso at binti ko. &#x200b; pagtingin ko sa picture na kinuha ko (kinuha ng girlfriend ko 'yung cellphone ko at itinago pero nakita ko rin naman sa closet niya noong makalabas ako sa ospital), naguluhan ako sa nakita ko. sa larawan, nakatingin ako sa camera at nakangiti. sa tabi ko, may isang matandang babae ang nakaupo. kulubot na ang kanyang mga mukha at kulay abo na ang mga buhok. suot-suot niya ang favorite t-shirt ng nobya ko. &#x200b; napailing na lang ako sa nakita ko. bilib na bilib pa naman ako sa camera ng iphone pero mukhang nagma-malfunction din pala ito. kaya ngayon, samsung na ang telepono ko. hindi ko na rin kinuhanan pa ng litrato ang girlfriend ko. &#x200b; rule #4. huwag magpapakita ng kabaitan sa ibang mga babae. ops! baka isipin niyo na selosa at mahigpit ang girlfriend ko. naku, diyan po kayo nagkakamali. sa katunayan, ayos lang sa kanya na makipagkaibigan ako sa mga babae. hindi siya nagagalit o nagtatampo. naalala ko nga noon, mayroon akong naging kaibigang babae sa trabaho, si carla. siyempre, tayong mga lalaki, natural na friendly tayo sa mga kababaihan. accomodating tayo at mahilig magbiro at mag-joke. madalas tuloy ay pinaghihinalaan tayo ng ating mga girlfriends. pero, iba ang girlfriend ko. ayos lang sa kanya ang ganoon. kahit nakikita niyang magkasama kami ni carla at nagtatawanan kapag bumibisita siya sa office, hindi siya nagagalit. nakakalungkot nga lang na hindi na natin kapiling si carla ngayon. natagpuan na lang siya isang umaga sa kuwarto niya, patay na. noong bumisita ako sa burol niya, nasabi sa akin ng kapatid niya na na-overdose daw sa gamot si carla. pagpasok daw nila sa kuwarto niya, nakita nila si carla na nakahiga sa kama, bumubula ang bibig. sa tabi niya, maraming nagkalat na gamot. puro tusok din ng karayom ang buong katawan niya. marahil daw, dahil sa depresyon o anumang mental illness, tinusok-tusok ni carla ang sarili niya ng karayom at pagkatapos ay uminom ng maraming gamot. ang nakapagtataka lamang daw, wala silang nakitang anumang karayom sa kuwarto ni carla. &#x200b; gaya nga ng sabi ko, hindi selosa ang girlfriend ko. marami akong mga naging kaibigang babae. nandyan si cherry na dating classmate ko noong college. marahil ay nakita mo siya sa balita. isang gabi kasi, habang papauwi galing trabaho, may tumulak daw sa kanya kaya nasagasaan siya ng isang bus. naging close ko rin si june at si barbie. kaso lang, maaga silang kinuha ni lord. bigla na lang silang na-comatose at hindi na nagising. over-fatigued daw sabi ng mga doktor. &#x200b; inaasar nga ako ng mga kaibigan ko ngayon na under daw ako ng girlfriend ko kaya hindi ako nakikipagkaibigan sa mga babae. pero ayos lang naman sa akin. mas masaya akong tawaging under kaysa naman magkaroon ng mga babaeng kaibigan pagkatapos... &#x200b; rule #5. kapag nagising ka sa madaling araw at nakita si girlfriend na naghahanap ng pagkain at mukhang gutom na gutom, magtago sa closet o kaya'y tumalon sa bintana. nakakatawa itong experience na ito. bakit ba ang mga babae, laging gutom? tapos, kapag pinakain mo masaya na kaagad sila? &#x200b; nagising ako isang beses mga alas-tres 'yata iyon. may narinig kasi akong mga kalampag kaya bumangon ako. wala rin kasi si girlfriend sa tabi ko. sa kusina ko siya nakita, hinahalughog ang ref namin. kaso, hindi pa kami nakakapag-grocery dahil wala pang sahod. &#x200b; tiningnan niya ako, nakakunot ang noo niya. ""gutom na ako,"" sabi niya. kahit gutom, sobrang ganda pa rin niya. kaya hindi ko napansin na tumutulo na pala ang laway niya. &#x200b; siyempre, ayokong nagugutom ang girlfriend ko kaya agad akong tumawag para magpa-deliver. pero, hindi na nakapagpigil pa ang girlfriend ko. sobrang gutom na siya, eh. kaya, ayun! &#x200b; pagkatapos niyang kumain, sobrang saya na niya. &#x200b; anyways, naging maayos naman ang lahat. ngayon, alam ko na ang gagawin kapag nakita siyang ganoon kaya wala naman na kaming naging problema pa. at saka, pwede namang mabuhay na isa lang ang kidney mo, hindi ba? basta't sisiguraduhin ko lang na hindi na ito mauulit pa. nag-iisa na lang ang natitira, eh. &#x200b; oh, napakadali lamang namang tandaan, 'di ba? 'yung ibang girlfriend diyan, napaka-demanding, ang dami-daming gusto, ang dami-daming ayaw. pero girlfriend ko, simple lang. simple pero perfect. kaya napakasaya ko sa kanya, eh. hindi ko na siya papakawalan. at siguradong-sigurado ako na hinding-hindi na niya ako papakawalan. &#x200b; edit: sa mga nagco-comment po at concerned sa akin, huwag po kayong mag-alala. ayos lang po ako. masaya, rewarding, at healthy ang relationship naming dalawa. oo, aaminin ko na medyo underweight ako ngayon nang kaunti (malnourished daw sabi ng doktor pero ano ba namang alam ng doktor? gusto lang akong pagka-perahan 'nun, eh!). medyo napapadalas din akong atakihin ng anemia (although hindi naman ako anemic dati, weird). pero, overall, perfect and happy kaming dalawa. &#x200b; tunay na love ko ang girlfriend ko!!! &#x200b; please subscribe to my pinoy horror animation channel!!! yt: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnaflx-rcdu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnaflx-rcdu)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/oiwuig/perpekto_ang_girlfriend_ko_basta_susundin_mo_lang/,12 07 2021
"alex, tanghaling tapat ng sabado, 2021","(any review for this is very-very much appreciated. i'm an aspiring writer po and i just launched a passion project anthology, isa po ito sa mga kwento) &#x200b; **chairman** ngayon ko lang naranasan ‘to sa tagal ko nang nanunungkulan sa barangay. isama mo na sa mga karanasang ‘yon ang lahat ng away mag-asawa, suntukan ng mga lasing, at mga batang ginagahasa sa bukiran. pero eto… ngayon ko lang napansin na buong araw ko na palang hinihimas ang rosaryong nakasabit sa leeg ko. maya’t-maya ko pa hinahalikan at binubulungan na sana’y wag mangyari sa pamilya ko ang nakita ko kanina. naririnig ko pa rin ang sigaw ni cecil, kumare’t-kapitbahay namin, tanghaling tapat ng sabado, kung saan ang tanghalian sa buong kalsada nami’y naantala dahil sa kanyang nakakakilabot na sigaw. sa ilalim ng nagbabagang init ay nagsitakbuhan kami upang sumaklolo. kinailangan ko pang iwanan ang tinola ni misis at ang isang basong softdrinks na nilalanguyan pa dalawang yelo nang ako’y tumakbo papunta sa bahay ni cecil. ngayo’y hindi pa rin ako kumakain. sa totoo nga’y hindi pa ako nakakaranas ng gutom. hindi ko pa ata kaya. sa bahay ni cecil ay dinatnan namin ang katawan ng panganay ni cecil na si joe na nakaratay sa braso ng kanyang bunsong kapatid na si alex, sa sahig ng kanilang sala. sa leeg ni joe ay nakabaon ang basag na bote na ginamit ni alex na balot na balot sa dugo ng kanyang kapatid. agad ang kapit at halik ko sa aking rosaryo nang makita ko ang imahe; na parang sinaunang obra na naglalahad ng malagim na kwento. pero ano ang kwento neto? hanggang ngayon ay wala pa rin kaming ideya kung bakit. magmula sa pagsigaw ni cecil ng, “anong nangyari?! anak, anong nangyari?!” sa tulalang alex na nakatitig sa dilat na mga mata ni joe, hanggang sa pagpunta namin dito sa aking opisina sa barangay, ay wala pa rin kaming makuhang rason mula sa bakit. sa isang maliit na kwarto sa aking opisina’y pinaupo ko muna si alex. tulala at sinusubukang burahin ang dugo sa kanyang mukha gamit ang duguan ring damit n’ya. hinainan ko ng isang bote ng softdrinks at tatlong pandesal mula pa sa agahan namin kanina si alex, na agad namang n’yang kinain ng walang pag-aalinlangan. dito na nagsimulang gumapang ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod. isang kilabot na hindi ko maipaliwanag, habang pinapanood ko si alex na walang awat sa pagkain, habang ako’y hindi ko pa rin magawang matakam sa masarap na lutong nag-aabang sa’kin sa bahay. “alex,” marahan kong sinabi. “ba’t mo ginawa ‘yun?” tumingin lamang sa’kin si alex, patay na mga mata, bibig na mabagal ang nguya. at sa kanyang paglunok ay walang mga salitang bumalik sa’kin. hindi ko alam kung bakit pero bigla kong naalala si jefferson, isang tricycle driver dito sa’min. dalawang taon na ang nakakalipas nang mapatay n’ya ang isang dayo na nakaaway n’ya sa kalsada. nangyari ‘to nang kamuntikan n’yang makasalpukan ang sasakyan ng dayo, at nang nahinto silang dalawa’y nagkasagutan muna sila bago mapikon si jefferson. hinampas n’ya ng bakal na tubo ang dayo. hindi na raw n’ya napigilan dahil sa mga mapanglait na mga salitang tinawag sa kanya. bobo, unggoy, uling, mababa. labing-isang beses paulit-ulit na hinampas ni jefferson sa ulo ang dayo, at sa sobrang lakas ng bawat hampas ay may parte na ng utak na lumabas dito. sa prisinto’y naalala ko si jefferson, iyak nang iyak at humihingi ng tawad dahil sa nangyari. hindi makakain, hindi rin makatulog. nilamon na s’ya ng konsensya n’ya, at ang konsensya n’ya ang tumulak sa kanya na agawin ang baril ng isa sa mga pulis na nagbabantay, at iputok sa kanyang sariling ulo. nasaktan si jefferson, nagalit, at di nakapagpigil. naintindihan ko ang kwento ‘nun. pero bakit hindi ko maintindihan ‘to? alam kong magkasundo ang magkapatid na ‘to. alam ko kung ga’no sila kalapit sa isa’t-isa. kaya pa’no nangyari ‘to? ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod ay gumagapang paakyat hanggang sa aking dibdib, tila ba kumakapit ng mahigpit. pasikip nang pasikip at medyo nahihirapan akong huminga. ang kakaibang pakiramdam na ‘to’y tumitindi habang nanatiling tahimik at nakatitig lamang sa’kin si alex. biglang iniabot ni alex ang kanyang kamay at dito tumalon na ang puso ko. napaatras ako sa aking kinauupuan, at mabilisan kong hinugot ang aking rosaryo mula sa pagkakatago nito sa aking damit. itinutok ko ito kay alex, na walang ibang kibo kun’di ang kunin ang bote ng softdrinks na nasa harapan n’ya. mas bumilis pa ang pagkatok sa aking dibdib, na para bang kamuntikan na kong mamatay. habang si alex nama’y pinapanood lang ako habang patuloy ang kanyang pag-inom. wala nga ata talagang mangyayari, at nang maramdaman ko kung gaano katahimik ang kwarto’y kumalma na ako. bakit sa dulo ng utak ko’y hinihiling ko na may sapi o di kaya’y isang demonyo talaga ang kaharap ko, at sa presensya ng aking rosaryo’y masasaktan s’ya. kahit anong kakaiba. kahit ano basta magkaroon lang ng eksplenasyon ang nangyari. pero siguro’y kakaiba na rin ang ikinikilos ng bata. at siguro nga’y mas dapat talaga akong matakot sa buhay kaysa sa patay. **cecil** “saan ba ko nagkulang?” tanong ni aling cecil sa mga kumare n’yang nakapalibot sa kanya sa masikip na opisina ni chairmain. napapaligiran din s’ya ng makukulay na mga pamaypay na hindi sabay-sabay ang pagaspas sa harap n’ya; nilulunod si aling cecil sa hangin. ang kanyang mukha nama’y tila ba isang rebulto ng santo kung punas-punasan ng mga panyo. “hindi ko pa rin maintindihan,” dugtong n’ya. “hindi naman ako nagkulang sa aruga. pareho ko namang pinapakita sa kanila na pantay ang pagmamahal ko sa kanila.” tuyo na ang mga mata ni aling cecil, ngunit tila ba hindi pa rin tapos ang kanyang pag-iyak. “hindi sila nag-aaway. hindi ko man lang narinig na nagtalo silang dalawa. o kung may pagtatalo man, malamang sa malamang maliit na bagay lang ‘yun. hindi yung ikakamatay mo!” isang labi ng lumapit sa tenga ni aling cecil, “alam mo tingin ko, baka inggit ‘yan. kasi si joe lang may trabaho sa kanilang dalawa, di ba? tapos si alex, wala pa rin sa kolehiyo. nag-aaral pa rin. sigurado akong ‘yun ang dahilan.” isa pang labi ang lumapit sa kabilang tenga naman ni aling cecil, “baka napikon na. kasi di ba halos s’ya na sa lahat ng gawaing bahay? baka pakiramdam n’ya porke’t mas malaki ambag ng kapatid n’ya , alila na s’ya neto.” isang labi naman na kaharap ni aling cecil ang nagsabing, “baka nagbabait-baitan lang kasi nga si joe ang halos sumasalo sa mga bayarin, pati sa pag-aaral n’ya. pero galit talaga s’ya, kasi baka naman may pagkakataong mas nabibigyang-atensyon si joe kahit hindi n’yo napapansin. kasi halimbawa uuwi s’yang pagod galing sa trabaho, syempre di n’yo maiwasang alagaan, pagsilbihan.” sa gitna ng mga labing ito’y si aling cecil, at ang ideyang unti-unting nabubuo dahil sa mga sinasabi ng mga labi sa kanya. “siguro,” sabi n’ya. “siguro nga.” **abbie** ang pangalan n’ya’y abbie. social worker daw s’ya. pagpasok n’ya’y agad bumungad sa’kin ang asul na bra sa ilalim ng dilaw na blouse nang tapatan ito ng liwanag mula sa bintanang katabi ko. sa kanyang pagtali ng buhok ay nakita kong basang-basa na ang kanyang kili-kili at kumikinang na sa pawis ang kanyang leeg. “alex?” sabi n’ya habang maya’t-mayang tinutulak ng kanyang daliri ang salamin n’yang dumudulas sa kanyang matangos na ilong. “bakit di mo ikwento muna sa’kin ang nangyari bago tayo umalis dito?” pasensya ka na, abbie. hindi ko nagawang sabihin kay chairman, na kilala pa mandin namin. hinding-hindi ko rin masasabi sa’yo. walang ibang maglalahad ng nangyari kun’di ang mga taong nais magbigay kahulugan dito, kasi kung ako tatanungin kung bakit, sa totoo lang, hindi ko rin alam ang isasagot. may nabasag akong bote sa kusina kanina, at sa pagpulot ko nito’y pumasok sa isip ko ang isang udyok. yung tipo ng udyok kapag nasa mataas kang lugar, at bigla mo na lang gustong itulak ang kasama mo. pero alam mong hindi ito dapat gawin, at kakapit ka pa nang mas mahigpit sa kanila para masiguro mong hindi ito mangyayari. ang udyok na ito’y nagsabi sa’kin na isaksak ko kay kuya ang basag na bote. at nalaman ko na lang na totoo na pala ang lahat nang dumapo sa aking balat ang mainit na dugo ni kuya. nahinto lang ako nang maramdaman ko ang buto sa leeg n’ya at nang marinig kong nabibilaukan na s’ya sa kanyang sariling dugo. hindi ko pa rin alam kung bakit. sana, tulad ng iniisip ni chairman, ay nasapian na nga lang ako. pero nakita ko ang lahat, andun ako. hindi ko lang alam na totoo pala ang lahat. namatay si kuya joe sa wala. at hindi ko matanggap na wala. normal lang sana ang sabado namin. tahimik. nanonood lang si kuya ng tv, naglilinis ako sa kusina. si nanay nama’y namamalengke ng pananghalian namin. bicol express daw ang lulutuin n’ya. puta, sinira ko ang araw. gusto kong umiyak dahil hindi na kami babalik sa salo-salo namin. “alex?” muling tawag ni abbie. “gusto kong malaman kung bakit. tayong dalawa lang. kaibigan mo ko dito. hinding-hindi ko ‘to sasabihin sa nanay mo, sa mga kapitbahay n’yo. may mga naririnig ako sa labas na dahil daw sa inggit? totoo ba ‘to? sa inggit nga? magmula nang dinala ako ni chairman dito sa maliit na kwartong ito’y napagpasyahan kong manahimik na lang sa nangyari. sa ngayo’y nilalabanan ko ang mga luha, nilalabanan ko ang panginginig ng aking bibig, at ang mga salitang gustong lumabas mula sa’kin. dapat mukhang hindi ko pinagsisisihan. dapat mukha akong galit. para naman mabigyang halaga, mabigyan ng ibig-sabihin ang pagkamatay ni kuya joe. dapat tinatatak ko sa utak ko na dapat lang! dapat lang sa kanya ang nangyari. dapat hindi ako bibigay. dahil kapag natalo ako, mamatay talaga sa wala si kuya. “sige, kung ayaw mong magkwento, ako muna. kasi naalala ko ‘tong isang batang babae at ang tatay n’yang abusado. tatay n’yang lasinggero. tatay n’yang isang beses s’yang hinipuan sa kanyang sariling kwarto at pinilit. ampon ang batang ‘yon, at tatay-tatayan n’ya lang etong umaabuso sa kanya. takot na takot ang bata dahil pakiramdam n’ya isang gabi’y papatayin na lang s’ya bigla neto. kaya naman isang gabi, nang bigla s’yang pinuntahan ng kanyang tatay upang pagsamantalahan ulit, sinasaksak ito ng bata gamit ang lapis sa mata, sa leeg, at sa dibdib.” kumuha ng panyo si abbie. sa kanyang paggalaw ay muling sumisilip ang kanyang bra sa likod ng blouse na parang mga batang naglalaro sa likod ng kurtina. “masarap sa pakiramdam, pero pumapatay pa rin s’ya ng tao. ilan taon n’yang dinibdib ‘yun. hanggang ngayon nararamdaman pa rin n’ya ang mga kamay ng tatay n’ya sa kanyang ari. sa kanyang dibdib. ilang taon bago n’ya matanggap ang ginawa n’ya. ngayon, medyo mahirap pa ring ikwento, pero kahit papaano’y kaya ko na. nangyari na kasi.” para bang may sumuntok sa aking dibdib nang marinig ko ‘to. bigla kong tinanggal ang aking paningin sa kanyang bra, at sa paggalaw ng aking mga mata’y bigla kong naramdaman ang pamumuo ng mga luha. “ayos lang, alex. pero andito lang ako. aalagaan ka muna namin. tapos pag handa ka na, makikinig ako. kahit pakonte-konte pa, ayos lang. aantayin kong mabuo ang kwento mo.” bumibilis bigla ang tibok ng puso ko. lalong nanginginig ang aking labi. at biglang pumasok si kuya sa isip ko, tumatakbo papalayo sa akin. mga bata pa kami, at hinahabol ko s’ya. “alex?” kuya wag kang lumayo! “alex?” kuya dito ka lang! kailangan kita dito! “sige, ayusin na natin pag-alis mo.” at parang isang batang nadapa sa semento, dito na walang awat na tumulo ang luha sa aking mga mata. “alex?” “hindi ko rin alam… hindi… ko rin alam. sorry, kuya! sorry! hindi ko rin alam kung bakit! patayin n’yo na lang ako! hindi ko alam anong nangyari! hindi ko na kaya!” lumalabo na ang aking paningin, pero kahit ga’no kalabo ang aking mga mata’y kitang-kita ko ang gulat at takot sa mukha ni abbie. pasensya ka na, kuya.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/nlygsa/alex_tanghaling_tapat_ng_sabado_2021/,27 05 2021

Update on Nala my Maltichon,"for anyone else wondering here's my previous post about her: [help me raise 8k php for my dog nala](https://www.reddit.com/r/philippines/comments/gn1qjm/please_help_me_raise_php_8k_for_my_dog_nala_for/) *we succesfully gathered around php 3k with all your help and i'm really glad and amazed what you people can do for a stranger's dog. maraming salamat po! sincerely from me.* so i'm posting this update para sa mga redditors na nag follow kay nala especially sa mga nag donate. **may 22:** around 2 days after i posted a cry for help sa r/philippines nala isn't getting any better, kumakain pa din may gana pero hindi na ganun kalakas kagaya dati. but thursday night hindi siya kumain which is hindi naman nakakabahala, unfortunately morning to tanghali ayaw niya pa rin kumain so i tried carrying her and kinakausap ko siya but she's not responding. nabahala ako so tinry ko siya itayo para maglakad lakad pero bumabagsak lang siya ulit, nagpanic na ako so i called his original vet if he could help. i know it's a reach kasi ecq pa pero makakapunta daw siya hintayin ko daw siya sa bahay. when he arrived he told me to rush nala sa clinic nila (his original vet clinic) so nalaman ko nagbukas na pala sila around 2nd week of may. sinugod namin si nala sa furry friends sa caloocan and luckily siya lang ang patient non. they told me na grabe na yung damage sa skin niya and saw na baka may maggots yung paws na niya. they also told me that amputation is possible kapag unrepairable na or nabubulok na sugat niya especially sa paws at sa tail. masyado dinb daw manipis balat ni nala and napakadaming flakes na nagfafall off from her body kaya siya nangangati. &#x200b; [at furry friends clinic](https://preview.redd.it/saqrwsbx70251.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9443944503ec0cdd2041bd25de98691f5de3085b) i decided to skin scrape and cbc her. never pa siya na cbc, so ayun ang goal ko kasi hindi ko alam bakit hindi pa siya gumagaling since march. sa skin scrape nakita na meron siyang demodex (hindi ko po alam spelling) pero its an insect that causes itchyness and galis. she's positive for mange. the problem is usually marami na daw yung 1 to 2 na insect sa isang skin scrape pero sa kanya 12 (take note na hindi pa yun sa sugat kumuha) which indicates na sobrang abnormal na ng dami nung parasites. &#x200b; [shivers and cleaning ng sugat niya](https://preview.redd.it/eewwtclz70251.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=47d84285281125ed50cf12986e72905fba1b77b2) they told me this is caused by stress. dapat daw na cocontrol ng immune system niya yung pagdami nun kaso dahil na stress siya most probably because of the grooming kasi dun nagsimula siya mangati, sobrang dumami yung demodex. they even showed me what's on the microscope. nakakalungkot isipin na dahil lang sa simpleng grooming nagkaganyan na yung dating healthy na siya. cbc came out and they saw an abnormality sa mga components. may bacterial infection siya kaya bumababa ata ang hemoglobin niya hindi ko gaanong sure. while we were discussing, nala started to shiver and the doctor said na kinokombulsyon siya kasi 40 degrees yung temperature niya. &#x200b; [sorry nabura na yung cbc na naka attach, i also lost the computation how much it costs but naka php 3200 ako, she has around 6 na iniintake and a spray, plus the three injections.](https://preview.redd.it/z82q4n1380251.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9adfcdb1977fff2d30706a925e9023975745cb67) &#x200b; https://preview.redd.it/50ji08fa80251.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bea67e1d3f2a8d1a55a0fcf680fe2d1c326b73b0 they cleaned her sugat. and injected her three times. yung dalawa anti mange/anti parasite and yung isa for her fever. they told me na this will be a 6 week long na gamutan and babalik kami dun every friday starting 22. i agreed. they also told me to stop seeking for convenia because it'll be too costly and hindi sure na gagana, at least eto daw proven, they told me to make nala sa comfortable as possible to reduce her stress. bumalik na kami last friday and the doctors said na shes getting better albeit she lost .4 kg. pinalitan na din namin diet niya to reflex pero hindi niya gaanong kinakain. she's still weak, barely walking but nakakalakad na at least. the first 3 days din from 22 kamot siya ng kamot as in walang tigil kaya nakaka stress pero since monday she stopped itching na. nagtatanggalan na langib niya din. &#x200b; [her favorite spot on my chair](https://preview.redd.it/evaj95l190251.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=575df5eb0c79a5f0e8595cdfc248329bbbb63014) &#x200b; &#x200b; [latest pic, hindi na reddish skin niya and nagtatanggalan na scabs niya.](https://preview.redd.it/lpfmo7t390251.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4cbf0b6cdff492d9a6045c04268ec1345d1f9533) i**'m here to post this update to thank you guys for the support.** masakit man, pero kelangan ko kayo because some of my family members think na sayang lang ang pera sa kanya at ipamigay na lang daw namin tapos bumili na lang kami ng aso. i had arguments with my family because of this. maraming salamat po, she's recovering slowly pero hindi namin siya titigilan hanggang sa hindi siya gumagaling! **donations are still welcome, sobrang maappreciate namin yung donation because i barely have anything left.** 6 weeks na gamutan pa siya and every week may injection sa kanya. i hope na you guys are still willing to donate to an anonymous stranger and his dog. *if you are willing to donate please drop me a dm. pwede na din po bank kasi nakausap ko na gf ko and she lent me her bank account for donations.* ***please dm me for account # or gcash.*** &#x200b; thank you so much!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/gtqe7f/update_on_nala_my_maltichon/,31 05 2020
"alex, tanghaling tapat ng sabado, 2021","(any review for this is very-very much appreciated. i'm an aspiring writer po and i just launched a passion project anthology, isa po ito sa mga kwento) &#x200b; **chairman** ngayon ko lang naranasan ‘to sa tagal ko nang nanunungkulan sa barangay. isama mo na sa mga karanasang ‘yon ang lahat ng away mag-asawa, suntukan ng mga lasing, at mga batang ginagahasa sa bukiran. pero eto… ngayon ko lang napansin na buong araw ko na palang hinihimas ang rosaryong nakasabit sa leeg ko. maya’t-maya ko pa hinahalikan at binubulungan na sana’y wag mangyari sa pamilya ko ang nakita ko kanina. naririnig ko pa rin ang sigaw ni cecil, kumare’t-kapitbahay namin, tanghaling tapat ng sabado, kung saan ang tanghalian sa buong kalsada nami’y naantala dahil sa kanyang nakakakilabot na sigaw. sa ilalim ng nagbabagang init ay nagsitakbuhan kami upang sumaklolo. kinailangan ko pang iwanan ang tinola ni misis at ang isang basong softdrinks na nilalanguyan pa dalawang yelo nang ako’y tumakbo papunta sa bahay ni cecil. ngayo’y hindi pa rin ako kumakain. sa totoo nga’y hindi pa ako nakakaranas ng gutom. hindi ko pa ata kaya. sa bahay ni cecil ay dinatnan namin ang katawan ng panganay ni cecil na si joe na nakaratay sa braso ng kanyang bunsong kapatid na si alex, sa sahig ng kanilang sala. sa leeg ni joe ay nakabaon ang basag na bote na ginamit ni alex na balot na balot sa dugo ng kanyang kapatid. agad ang kapit at halik ko sa aking rosaryo nang makita ko ang imahe; na parang sinaunang obra na naglalahad ng malagim na kwento. pero ano ang kwento neto? hanggang ngayon ay wala pa rin kaming ideya kung bakit. magmula sa pagsigaw ni cecil ng, “anong nangyari?! anak, anong nangyari?!” sa tulalang alex na nakatitig sa dilat na mga mata ni joe, hanggang sa pagpunta namin dito sa aking opisina sa barangay, ay wala pa rin kaming makuhang rason mula sa bakit. sa isang maliit na kwarto sa aking opisina’y pinaupo ko muna si alex. tulala at sinusubukang burahin ang dugo sa kanyang mukha gamit ang duguan ring damit n’ya. hinainan ko ng isang bote ng softdrinks at tatlong pandesal mula pa sa agahan namin kanina si alex, na agad namang n’yang kinain ng walang pag-aalinlangan. dito na nagsimulang gumapang ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod. isang kilabot na hindi ko maipaliwanag, habang pinapanood ko si alex na walang awat sa pagkain, habang ako’y hindi ko pa rin magawang matakam sa masarap na lutong nag-aabang sa’kin sa bahay. “alex,” marahan kong sinabi. “ba’t mo ginawa ‘yun?” tumingin lamang sa’kin si alex, patay na mga mata, bibig na mabagal ang nguya. at sa kanyang paglunok ay walang mga salitang bumalik sa’kin. hindi ko alam kung bakit pero bigla kong naalala si jefferson, isang tricycle driver dito sa’min. dalawang taon na ang nakakalipas nang mapatay n’ya ang isang dayo na nakaaway n’ya sa kalsada. nangyari ‘to nang kamuntikan n’yang makasalpukan ang sasakyan ng dayo, at nang nahinto silang dalawa’y nagkasagutan muna sila bago mapikon si jefferson. hinampas n’ya ng bakal na tubo ang dayo. hindi na raw n’ya napigilan dahil sa mga mapanglait na mga salitang tinawag sa kanya. bobo, unggoy, uling, mababa. labing-isang beses paulit-ulit na hinampas ni jefferson sa ulo ang dayo, at sa sobrang lakas ng bawat hampas ay may parte na ng utak na lumabas dito. sa prisinto’y naalala ko si jefferson, iyak nang iyak at humihingi ng tawad dahil sa nangyari. hindi makakain, hindi rin makatulog. nilamon na s’ya ng konsensya n’ya, at ang konsensya n’ya ang tumulak sa kanya na agawin ang baril ng isa sa mga pulis na nagbabantay, at iputok sa kanyang sariling ulo. nasaktan si jefferson, nagalit, at di nakapagpigil. naintindihan ko ang kwento ‘nun. pero bakit hindi ko maintindihan ‘to? alam kong magkasundo ang magkapatid na ‘to. alam ko kung ga’no sila kalapit sa isa’t-isa. kaya pa’no nangyari ‘to? ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod ay gumagapang paakyat hanggang sa aking dibdib, tila ba kumakapit ng mahigpit. pasikip nang pasikip at medyo nahihirapan akong huminga. ang kakaibang pakiramdam na ‘to’y tumitindi habang nanatiling tahimik at nakatitig lamang sa’kin si alex. biglang iniabot ni alex ang kanyang kamay at dito tumalon na ang puso ko. napaatras ako sa aking kinauupuan, at mabilisan kong hinugot ang aking rosaryo mula sa pagkakatago nito sa aking damit. itinutok ko ito kay alex, na walang ibang kibo kun’di ang kunin ang bote ng softdrinks na nasa harapan n’ya. mas bumilis pa ang pagkatok sa aking dibdib, na para bang kamuntikan na kong mamatay. habang si alex nama’y pinapanood lang ako habang patuloy ang kanyang pag-inom. wala nga ata talagang mangyayari, at nang maramdaman ko kung gaano katahimik ang kwarto’y kumalma na ako. bakit sa dulo ng utak ko’y hinihiling ko na may sapi o di kaya’y isang demonyo talaga ang kaharap ko, at sa presensya ng aking rosaryo’y masasaktan s’ya. kahit anong kakaiba. kahit ano basta magkaroon lang ng eksplenasyon ang nangyari. pero siguro’y kakaiba na rin ang ikinikilos ng bata. at siguro nga’y mas dapat talaga akong matakot sa buhay kaysa sa patay. **cecil** “saan ba ko nagkulang?” tanong ni aling cecil sa mga kumare n’yang nakapalibot sa kanya sa masikip na opisina ni chairmain. napapaligiran din s’ya ng makukulay na mga pamaypay na hindi sabay-sabay ang pagaspas sa harap n’ya; nilulunod si aling cecil sa hangin. ang kanyang mukha nama’y tila ba isang rebulto ng santo kung punas-punasan ng mga panyo. “hindi ko pa rin maintindihan,” dugtong n’ya. “hindi naman ako nagkulang sa aruga. pareho ko namang pinapakita sa kanila na pantay ang pagmamahal ko sa kanila.” tuyo na ang mga mata ni aling cecil, ngunit tila ba hindi pa rin tapos ang kanyang pag-iyak. “hindi sila nag-aaway. hindi ko man lang narinig na nagtalo silang dalawa. o kung may pagtatalo man, malamang sa malamang maliit na bagay lang ‘yun. hindi yung ikakamatay mo!” isang labi ng lumapit sa tenga ni aling cecil, “alam mo tingin ko, baka inggit ‘yan. kasi si joe lang may trabaho sa kanilang dalawa, di ba? tapos si alex, wala pa rin sa kolehiyo. nag-aaral pa rin. sigurado akong ‘yun ang dahilan.” isa pang labi ang lumapit sa kabilang tenga naman ni aling cecil, “baka napikon na. kasi di ba halos s’ya na sa lahat ng gawaing bahay? baka pakiramdam n’ya porke’t mas malaki ambag ng kapatid n’ya , alila na s’ya neto.” isang labi naman na kaharap ni aling cecil ang nagsabing, “baka nagbabait-baitan lang kasi nga si joe ang halos sumasalo sa mga bayarin, pati sa pag-aaral n’ya. pero galit talaga s’ya, kasi baka naman may pagkakataong mas nabibigyang-atensyon si joe kahit hindi n’yo napapansin. kasi halimbawa uuwi s’yang pagod galing sa trabaho, syempre di n’yo maiwasang alagaan, pagsilbihan.” sa gitna ng mga labing ito’y si aling cecil, at ang ideyang unti-unting nabubuo dahil sa mga sinasabi ng mga labi sa kanya. “siguro,” sabi n’ya. “siguro nga.” **abbie** ang pangalan n’ya’y abbie. social worker daw s’ya. pagpasok n’ya’y agad bumungad sa’kin ang asul na bra sa ilalim ng dilaw na blouse nang tapatan ito ng liwanag mula sa bintanang katabi ko. sa kanyang pagtali ng buhok ay nakita kong basang-basa na ang kanyang kili-kili at kumikinang na sa pawis ang kanyang leeg. “alex?” sabi n’ya habang maya’t-mayang tinutulak ng kanyang daliri ang salamin n’yang dumudulas sa kanyang matangos na ilong. “bakit di mo ikwento muna sa’kin ang nangyari bago tayo umalis dito?” pasensya ka na, abbie. hindi ko nagawang sabihin kay chairman, na kilala pa mandin namin. hinding-hindi ko rin masasabi sa’yo. walang ibang maglalahad ng nangyari kun’di ang mga taong nais magbigay kahulugan dito, kasi kung ako tatanungin kung bakit, sa totoo lang, hindi ko rin alam ang isasagot. may nabasag akong bote sa kusina kanina, at sa pagpulot ko nito’y pumasok sa isip ko ang isang udyok. yung tipo ng udyok kapag nasa mataas kang lugar, at bigla mo na lang gustong itulak ang kasama mo. pero alam mong hindi ito dapat gawin, at kakapit ka pa nang mas mahigpit sa kanila para masiguro mong hindi ito mangyayari. ang udyok na ito’y nagsabi sa’kin na isaksak ko kay kuya ang basag na bote. at nalaman ko na lang na totoo na pala ang lahat nang dumapo sa aking balat ang mainit na dugo ni kuya. nahinto lang ako nang maramdaman ko ang buto sa leeg n’ya at nang marinig kong nabibilaukan na s’ya sa kanyang sariling dugo. hindi ko pa rin alam kung bakit. sana, tulad ng iniisip ni chairman, ay nasapian na nga lang ako. pero nakita ko ang lahat, andun ako. hindi ko lang alam na totoo pala ang lahat. namatay si kuya joe sa wala. at hindi ko matanggap na wala. normal lang sana ang sabado namin. tahimik. nanonood lang si kuya ng tv, naglilinis ako sa kusina. si nanay nama’y namamalengke ng pananghalian namin. bicol express daw ang lulutuin n’ya. puta, sinira ko ang araw. gusto kong umiyak dahil hindi na kami babalik sa salo-salo namin. “alex?” muling tawag ni abbie. “gusto kong malaman kung bakit. tayong dalawa lang. kaibigan mo ko dito. hinding-hindi ko ‘to sasabihin sa nanay mo, sa mga kapitbahay n’yo. may mga naririnig ako sa labas na dahil daw sa inggit? totoo ba ‘to? sa inggit nga? magmula nang dinala ako ni chairman dito sa maliit na kwartong ito’y napagpasyahan kong manahimik na lang sa nangyari. sa ngayo’y nilalabanan ko ang mga luha, nilalabanan ko ang panginginig ng aking bibig, at ang mga salitang gustong lumabas mula sa’kin. dapat mukhang hindi ko pinagsisisihan. dapat mukha akong galit. para naman mabigyang halaga, mabigyan ng ibig-sabihin ang pagkamatay ni kuya joe. dapat tinatatak ko sa utak ko na dapat lang! dapat lang sa kanya ang nangyari. dapat hindi ako bibigay. dahil kapag natalo ako, mamatay talaga sa wala si kuya. “sige, kung ayaw mong magkwento, ako muna. kasi naalala ko ‘tong isang batang babae at ang tatay n’yang abusado. tatay n’yang lasinggero. tatay n’yang isang beses s’yang hinipuan sa kanyang sariling kwarto at pinilit. ampon ang batang ‘yon, at tatay-tatayan n’ya lang etong umaabuso sa kanya. takot na takot ang bata dahil pakiramdam n’ya isang gabi’y papatayin na lang s’ya bigla neto. kaya naman isang gabi, nang bigla s’yang pinuntahan ng kanyang tatay upang pagsamantalahan ulit, sinasaksak ito ng bata gamit ang lapis sa mata, sa leeg, at sa dibdib.” kumuha ng panyo si abbie. sa kanyang paggalaw ay muling sumisilip ang kanyang bra sa likod ng blouse na parang mga batang naglalaro sa likod ng kurtina. “masarap sa pakiramdam, pero pumapatay pa rin s’ya ng tao. ilan taon n’yang dinibdib ‘yun. hanggang ngayon nararamdaman pa rin n’ya ang mga kamay ng tatay n’ya sa kanyang ari. sa kanyang dibdib. ilang taon bago n’ya matanggap ang ginawa n’ya. ngayon, medyo mahirap pa ring ikwento, pero kahit papaano’y kaya ko na. nangyari na kasi.” para bang may sumuntok sa aking dibdib nang marinig ko ‘to. bigla kong tinanggal ang aking paningin sa kanyang bra, at sa paggalaw ng aking mga mata’y bigla kong naramdaman ang pamumuo ng mga luha. “ayos lang, alex. pero andito lang ako. aalagaan ka muna namin. tapos pag handa ka na, makikinig ako. kahit pakonte-konte pa, ayos lang. aantayin kong mabuo ang kwento mo.” bumibilis bigla ang tibok ng puso ko. lalong nanginginig ang aking labi. at biglang pumasok si kuya sa isip ko, tumatakbo papalayo sa akin. mga bata pa kami, at hinahabol ko s’ya. “alex?” kuya wag kang lumayo! “alex?” kuya dito ka lang! kailangan kita dito! “sige, ayusin na natin pag-alis mo.” at parang isang batang nadapa sa semento, dito na walang awat na tumulo ang luha sa aking mga mata. “alex?” “hindi ko rin alam… hindi… ko rin alam. sorry, kuya! sorry! hindi ko rin alam kung bakit! patayin n’yo na lang ako! hindi ko alam anong nangyari! hindi ko na kaya!” lumalabo na ang aking paningin, pero kahit ga’no kalabo ang aking mga mata’y kitang-kita ko ang gulat at takot sa mukha ni abbie. pasensya ka na, kuya.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/nlygsa/alex_tanghaling_tapat_ng_sabado_2021/,27 05 2021

Legal ba ang pet euthanasia dito? (Isabela province),"na parvo yung 2-month-old puppy ko. noong una palang na nagpakita siya ng signs ng pananamlay at pagsusuka, dinala na namin agad sa vet. once naconfirm na positive siya sa parvo naconfine naman siya agad pero mabilis na nagdeteriorate yung health niya. nung andun na siya sa clinic, nagi-start na syang magpoops ng dugo. tinanong ko na agad yung vet niya kung anong pwedeng maging option in case mag worsen yung kalagayan niya. kasi tinitignan ko yung liit nyan yun, iniimagine ko palang yung pagdadaanan niya sobrang naiiyak na ako. ngayon inaaffirm nila ako na kakayanin niya naman, kaya nagka hope naman ako na magiimprove yung kalagayan niya. basta i-observe lang daw. hindi naman sa pagiging pessimistic, pero gusto ko lang ding marinig yung isang possibility kahit sobrang sakit niyang isipin. gustong gusto ko syang gumaling i swear. pero kung ang ibig sabihin non e ioobserve siya ng ilang days para tignan kung magworkout yung gamutan niya. titignan kung maka survive siya o hindi. and in case man na makasurvive siya, hindi pa guaranteed na magkakaroon siya ng normal life after parvo. triny kong i brought up ko yung euthanasia, kung legal ba, kung pwede bang maging option. pero parang iniiwasan nilang sagutin. never nila akong binigyan ng exact na sagot. basta i-observe lang at kasi baka naman makasurvive siya. ngayon inoobserve namin si puppy. nakaswero parin siya at nagagamot pero parang hindi siya nagwowork. inoobserve nalang namin kung paano siya mag suffer ng unti-unti na syang nanghihina. constant na yung pagsusuka, pagtatae ng dugo, pag ihi niya. sobrang awang-awa na ako sa kanya. parang inaantay nalang namin na kusa siyang malagutan ng hininga. sobrang traumatizing at heartbreaking. i feel so helpless. gustong-gusto kong i-ease na yung nararamdaman niya kaso 'di ko naman alam kung papaano.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/16jghgd/legal_ba_ang_pet_euthanasia_dito_isabela_province/,15 09 2023
"Lost media help: Kaiju-style animated PSA about dehydration and diarrhea, circa 1990-95. Has anyone seen this or somehow own a copy?","as the title implies, back when i was very young and still living in manila there was this weird psa about dehydration and diarrhea that always played on tv. i was only there from 1990-95 and have since moved to portugal with my parents. it’s a funny but fond memory of my time there but i have never seen it since. rough premise: scene of a residential area or suburb with several houses pictured. it was night time when a pair of kaiju (giant monsters much like godzilla or king kong) came waltzing to town. these two monsters were named ‘pagtatae’ (literally means diarrhea) and ‘dehydration.’ diarrhea was stout and brutish, brown-colored and was made entirely of poop, kinda like clayface from batman the animated series except that this one is clearly made of something worse. dehydration was tall and lanky, white with maybe some greens or grays and made of water. diarrhea was voiced like your typical cartoon brute (think bluto) and dehydration spoke in hissy tones like a slimy villain (think gollum). i don’t remember them saying anything other than their names, kinda like pokemon. i don’t remember much else but i think they were defeated at the end, not sure who did it or how it was done. i’m pretty sure it was made by the health department. i’ve looked for clues in the internet, asked my filipino relatives, but sadly no leads. none of them remembers it either maybe because they’re not in the same age bracket as me. i know this is so obscure and a longshot but i hope someone out there had it recorded or something.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/xv60e3/lost_media_help_kaijustyle_animated_psa_about/,4 10 2022
Story time: Uninformed News Edition,"a friend showed me a tiktok video of a supposed influencer sharing his thoughts on covid. the video (with embedded texts) went like this: ""storytime: covid 19 edition and then dinala sa hospital, dead on arrival. then sabi nung doctor sa mga kamag anak. kung papayag yung family na ang ilagay sa death cert nung namatay ay covid instead of heart attack 😱😱. so yun lang, idk what to do with that information kaya skl."" let me answer you, what you should do with that information is ask someone who is knowledgeable on the topic or at least someone who knows more than you do, cause you definitely don't know a lot. what you should not do though is post a video putting the hospital and medical professionals in a malicious light. for those of you who wants to be educated on the topic: anyone who is symptomatic, we can't mix with those who do not have the symptoms. ubo, sipon, lagnat, hirap sa paghinga, pananakit ng kasukasuan, pagsusuka, pagtatae or pagkawala ng pang-amoy at panlasa. you might be wondering, eh ang daming sakit with the same symptoms. yes, kaya nga po puno ang emergency rooms and covid floors. unless proven na negative ka sa covid (with rt-pcr), it is prudent that we don't place you with those without the symptoms. hospital protocols also dictates that anyone who arrives dead will be tagged as covid suspect (relating to the tiktok vid, paano nasabing heart attack? may ckmb ka? may trop i ka? may ecg ka ba???). covid also complicates underlying conditions like heart, brain problems which might have led to the demise of the patient. did the patient die of a heart problem? possible. did the patient die of covid? possible. hindi sya exclusive, and unless we do post-mortem swab, we will not know. the government ideally should fund more research centers and laboratories, to make testing more available kahit sa maralita. sayang yung mga inutang. hindi lahat ng tao afford ang 2-5k na rt-pcr swab na may 7 days validity lang. pag may rt-pcr ka na timely ang collection, you need not be tagged as suspect and can be treated sa covid negative area, therefore decongesting the covid suspect area, therefore freeing some resources that can be used for those in critical conditions. i am all for freedom of expression, but i also believe in responsible posting. supposed ~influencers~ should help us eradicate misinformation, use their platform for greater good. you also address your audience well. isang taon na tayong lockdown, ang dami nang dinagdag na letra sa cq. baka naman po? if you have any questions, if in any way i can explain things in simpler terms. i also urge people in the medical field to answer people the simplest way possible, to be ""patola"" na. our job extends way outside the corners of the hospital. di na lang covid ang kalaban, bad governance, ignorance and misinformation too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/mgihgq/story_time_uninformed_news_edition/,30 03 2021

Wanna share some positive experiences with your parents growing up?,"fully aware of the pinoy parent stereotype and tropes. naging parte na ng psyche nating mga pinoy yung generational trauma, bad parenting tropes like ginawagawang retirement plan or emotional fullfillment ang anak, or super strict parents nung teenage years na biglang nagdedemand ng apo in their 20s, or yung common occurrence yung sigawan sa loob ng bahay. mas middle ground ako sa ganito, minsan nakaka-relate ako pero minsan hindi talaga ako nakakarelate at all (pero aware ako na common experience siya sa maraming pinoy). for instance, nakakarelate naman talaga yung striktong nanay na nagbibigay ng curfew. daming beses na naming nagtalo ng mama ko about curfew at bantayan pag-inom ko pag kasama ang barkada, pero never naman akong sheltered sa bahay na di pinapayagan lumabas. makulit lang siya na palaging may reminder pero ganun naman talaga ang nanay. kahit nung nasa late 20s na ako, tapos sila mismo nagsasabi sa'kin na di ko kailangan mag-anak agad. imbis na gawin kaming retirement plan ng magulang namin, inaassure kami na ""nak, di mo kailangan mag-alala sa'min pagtanda. covered kami ng insurance. basta bisitahin mo kami pag tumira na kami sa probinsya"". on the contrary, kami pa yung ineencourage mag-ipon at mag-invest. kahit yung dad ko, walang trace of machismo at all. payag siyang maging butt of the joke sa mga meal time namin. stereotypical dad siya yes, in the sense na marunong mag-karpintero, mag-ayos ng kuryente at tubo, may green thumb sa gardening. pero di kasama sa stereotype yung sexism at homophobia, baka kasi prof din dad ko. never kong nadinig doon yung mga linyang ""lalaki ka, dapat ganito"" other than dapat maging responsableng tao ako (pero sinasabi niya rin yun sa sister ko). since pareho din kaming prof, mga nerd history stuff mga pinag-uusapan namin madalas, siya din kasi parang uncle iroh na mahilig magbigay ng life lesson. nagagalit din naman siya pero bihira; tamang amount lang ng pinapagalitan ako pero sa mga pagkakataong gano'n gets ko agad kung bakit. at napakabihira ko silang nakikitang mag-away. siguro in a 3-year span, dalawang beses. i almost feel bad kasi andami kong friends na di gaanong magkasundo magulang nila, tapos marami-rami rin yung hiwalay yung magulang at may resentment. sa magulang ko, ramdam na ramdam mo na gusto pa rin nila company ng isa't isa kahit pushing 60 na sila pareho: sabay mag-meryenda kahit nagphophone lang pareho, di nauubusan ng kwento sa isa't isa, tapos malambing pa rin.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/15pnpb3/wanna_share_some_positive_experiences_with_your/,13 08 2023

Wish 107.5 and KDR Music House is a big scam,"have you ever wondered why, whenever you watch wish concerts, maraming very long-haired women wearing skirts ang umaattend? at minsan parang hindi pasok yung artist sa generation nila (ex. 60yo woman watching the juans concert). that is because these entertainment organizers are backed up by a church called mcgi, or popularly known as ""ang dating daan"" of eli soriano/daniel razon. to be fair, wala namang problema dito. but little people know that the majority of tickets for these events were forced on members. ibabagsak nila yang mga-overpriced tickets sa mga chapters nila and they will sell it under the guise of ""pagsuporta sa gawain/propagation of the gospel."" considered sold out yan kapag dinala sa chapter. believe it or not, it comes to a point na may utang ang chapter kapag hindi nila yan naubos. the members, who are mostly poor, will pitch in what they can just to make up for their backlog. worse, kahit binayaran nila yung tickets, hindi sa kanila binibigay. priority raw kasi yung non-church member para makapasok. tbh, i don't get this logic. but its somewhere along the lines of ""para magmukha tayong mabait (as a church) sa kanila."" ang mas malaking problema siguro dito is brainwashed na ang maraming mga members. some of them are willing to be exploited this way. they believe na supporting their so-called messenger of god is their ticket to heaven. btw, this scheme works in other businesses of daniel razon as well (kdr adventure camp, daniel's coffee, bes house of chicken, etc). i doubt na nagbabayad yan ng tamang taxes. wala naman kasing resibo yung mga transaction kapag within the church ang bentahan. as ordinary people, there is very little we can do to stop this system. but i'm really hoping some music artists, esp the woke ones, to boycott these event organizers. if you guys want proof of what i just mentioned here, i'll try to upload some screenshots ng mga gc in the comment section. i call on other mcgi members to upload as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ycwpfs/wish_1075_and_kdr_music_house_is_a_big_scam/,25 10 2022

"We lost contact with our mom, who works as an overseas Filipino worker in Riyadh","tl;dr: we have not heard anything from our mom for four days and we are worried about her safety. i reached out to her agency but there’s no update yet about her situation there. hello , i am the oldest son and just wanted to get this off my chest. i am currently a 3rd yr student and masyado akong na-busy last week gawa't midterms namin yon. last tuesday, napansin ko na hindi na tumatawag or nagchachat si mama at nakita ko na hindi siya talaga nag o-online. nagtaka na ko at sinubukan kong siyang i-message pero walang reply. ang last convo namin at last activity niya sa fb niya ay nung saturday pa. nag sabi na ko sa so ko at sabi niya we'll call owwa tom if wala pa rin response si mama that day. kinabuksan, tinawagan ko na ang owwa at binigay naman ang cellphone number ng agency ni mama para matawagan at i-raise ang concern. tinawagan ko pero walang sumasagot so nag iwan lang ako ng message. later that night, nag reply naman at sinabing ipapaabot daw nila sa foreign recruitment agency (fra). kinabukasan (today), nag send na ng message ang agency ni mama sa fra this morning at nag reply naman ang fra na they will check with the employer at babalikan daw ang agency kapag may update na. we were all so worried na to the point na si tita, nataranta na at tinawagan ang agency, baka raw inaway na ni tita ang nakausap niya sa agency at binantaan na ipapa tulfo daw (naiintindihan ko naman si tita kay usually ganon talaga mga kilala kong boomers) sabi ni ate na pinsan ko. now, super grateful ako kay so na nagagawa niya kong pakalmahin kahit napaka overthinker ko. we will pray for mama's safety there in riyadh. if may mga kakilala kayo sa fra o nasa riyadh (near alyasmi ), please baka matulungan niyo ko sa concern namin. i forgot, nung last vc namin ni mama ay nabanggit niya na minsan nahahampas niya na ang cp niya kasi raw naglalag gawa nang mabagal ang internet. hindi naman nananakit ang amo niya, mabait naman daw pero sinasabi niyang kuripot kay tinitipid daw siya sa food. so, i assumed na nasira ang phone ni mama kaya hindi namin siya ma-contact. i tried locating her phone through google's 'find my device' app, but i can't locate her. di naman nag ooff si mama ng gps niya sa phone kasi chinecheck ko yan siya before sa app na yan. ang concern ko lang ay baka ma-depress si mama ng todo kasi palagi siya nag rarant sa amin everyday sa tuwing tumatawag siya na nababagot na daw siya doon kasi wala siyang makausap. palagi niya kaming tinatawagan para hindi siya ma-bored doon, kahit na choppy siya. i will be celebrating my bday this month and my only wish is for her to be safe palagi sa saudi. debut ko na this yr at gusto ko sana kasama ko buong family ko mag celebrate pero nasa malayo si mama. pero kahit sana maka-vc man lang namin siya. i hope she's okay. i really miss her. take ko na rin tong opportunity to ask if totoo ba na hindi usually nasusunod ang kontrata ng mga ofw (in middle east, particularly, saudi), lalo na sa day off? update: a friend of my cousin's friend contacted my mother's employer and hung up when she uttered my mother's name. update (2): i want to express my heartfelt gratitude po for the overwhelming support and concern many of you shared in response to this post. i'm relieved to update you all na we've heard from my mom na, and she's safe, thank god! it turns out her employer's internet service was temporarily disconnected, and they estimate it could take up to 2 weeks to resolve. ito po yung reason bakit hindi siya nakapag-contact sa amin. wala po siyang sim card ng saudi and she doesn't have mobile data. di rin po siya basta pina-connect ng amo niya sa data nila. luckily, maybe after ma-raise ang concerns sa iba't-ibang agencies particularly sa fra ng mom ko na ilang beses tinawagan yung employer, her employer finally allowed her brief access to their data po, allowing her to contact us and provide reassurance. it was a very tough time for our entire family. i can't imagine if anything bad happens sa mom ko. thank you all for your support and kind words. it means the world to us, and we're now in a much better state knowing my mom is okay. appreciate you all po! lahat ng comments niyo binasa ko at sobrang laking tulong ng mga suggestions ninyo, and most importantly, ng mga prayers ninyong lahat 🙏 lesson learned: ngayon ko na-realize na ibang-iba talaga ang culture sa saudi. reality hits hard. di ko inexpect na pati sa mobile data ay kayang ipagdamot ng employer ng mama ko. tho i still believe na hindi naman lahat ng stereotype patungkol sa mga arabs ay totoo and cultural diversity plays a role in this. despite our struggles, i'm still very much grateful that my mom is safe and sound.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/18cr8a4/we_lost_contact_with_our_mom_who_works_as_an/,7 12 2023

pinagsisinungalingan ko lahat ng taong nakapaligid sakin kasi nahihiya akong aminin na wala na akong pera,"nagresign ako sa first and recent job ko last june. i'm a minimum wager and at the same time, breadwinner ng family ko. 3 pa yung mga kapatid kong nag aaral and yung papa ko is farmer sa probinsya. lahat sila andun, ako lang nandito. biglaan yung pagreresign ko. hindi ko talaga balak magresign. pero sobra na kasing nakakaapekto sa mental health ko yung work environment ko. talagang hindi ko na kaya. kaya biglaan din talaga. although hindi ako nagsisising nagresign ako kahit ganito nangyayari sakin ngayon. so fast forward, dahil nga minimum wager ako at tatlong kapatid ko pa ang pinag aaral ko, super di kasya yunh sweldo ko. kaya nagkaron ako ng utang. yung last payment na nakuha ko is pinambayad ko sa mga utang ko. pero hindi yan ang problem. last april, nagbook ako ng flight pauwi sa probinsya kasi almost 4 years ko nang di nakikita at nakakasama yung family ko. binook ko sya ng august 12 to 22 kasi august ang pinakamarami naming walang pasok dun sa work ko (kasi nga wala talaga sa plan ko ang magresign). 1 month na akong walang work. nagtry nako ng mga side husstles pero wala talaga. wala nakong pera. nung may pera kasi ako, ako gumagastos lahat dito sa bahay. dalawa kami ng kapatid ng papa ko dito sa bahay na tinitirahan ko. unfortunately, wala din syang work matagal na. pero kanya kanya kasi kami before. pero nung bago pa ako nawalan ng work, bumili ako ng mga kaldero lutuan etc kasi nga mawawalan ako work. tapos ayun, dati hindi sya dito nakain. sa iba. pero nung nagluluto luto nako, dito na sya lagi nakain. hanggang sa ako na lahat ang gumagastos. kapag di ako nag asikaso ng pagkain, sa labas or sa iba sya kakain. pero pag may pagkain dito, kakain sya. triny ko narin magluto ng pang akin lang, syempre may natitira pa dun diba, nagugulat ako pagcheck ko, kinain na nya. kaya hanggang sa heto nako now. it's been one week narin since huli akong kumain on time. palaging isang beses lang, or minsan hindi tulad kahapon. kanina kumain ako kasi inaya ako mg friend ko kumain sa kanila. isang beses lang ako kumain. kasi nga wlaa na talaga akong pera. august 12, flight ko na pauwi. maraming nagtatanong sakin about sa pag uwi ko and palagi konh sinasabi na tuloy ako. kasi hindi ko kayang sabihin sa kanila na wala na akonv pera pang uwi. namomroblema talaga ako sobra. nagdadalawang isip ako kunh uuwi pa ako. kung hindi ako uuwi, makakapag apply na ako. pero maghihintay na naman ako ng ilang buwan bago ako makauwi or worst next year na ako makauwi. sayang pati yung ticket ko kasi non refundable yun. nagiguilty ako sa pagsisinungaling ko sa mama ko, sa friends, relatives and even sa bf ko. pero hindi ko kayang aminin na wala na akong pera. lalo sa parents ko, sobrang excited pa naman nila na uuwi ako. hindi ko na alam ang gagawin ko. and hindi ko rin alam paano ako makakasurvive hanggang next week. nagtry nako mangutang kaso wala nga akong work, ayaw ako pautangin hahaha. dito ko nalang nilabas kasi hindi ko kayang sabihin kahit kanino. even my best friend, hindi ko talaga kaya. nanghihinayang ako sa chance na makauwi ako since bayad ko na yung ticket. pero anong gagawin ko? paano na? wala din namang pera sila mama. ang hopeless ng aking life. hahahahaha",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/15i4609/pinagsisinungalingan_ko_lahat_ng_taong/,4 08 2023

From a teacher's POV,"**was writing this as a reply to one post in another sub, but turned out a completely different thing... so i think i'll finish writing it here just to share a teacher's pov during this time. *kahit may maabot lang akong isang tao at mapaintindi ito, okay na.* also, pardon me for any errors in my writing; wrote this with tired eyes.** i won't defend any part of this system kahit pinapasweldo nila ako. kasi may mali talaga. in my case, i honestly wish i could do more for my students. i feel like students during this pandemic are robbed of the education and experience they deserve. right now kasi what i see is that the admins of deped and private schools are trying their best to save their reputations, but at the cost of the quality of education and mental health of the ones at the bottom of the hierarchy. our teachers and students get the short end of the stick. sorting 200+ modules by hand, checking that many papers, writing several reports, conducting classes synchronously and asynchronously, attending faculty meetings, fulfilling their admin's requests with only a short notice - these are some of the things that comprise a teacher's regular workday during this pandemic. sadly most of teachers right now are just too tired themselves to care about other people. meanwhile, students are juggling to self-learn a 10 to 20-page module for each of their 8 - 10 subjects, answer the activities of that many modules, read their teachers' constant nagging in messages, attend online consultations/classes, fulfill their household duties and certainly many more tasks. some students of mine even have to work and worry about their family's well-being. they're not productive, they're just busy. being productive and being busy are not the same. it's just a mess of a system. it's not teaching and learning, it's busywork. and we all know deep down that despite the several modules sorted and answered, all students will be granted passing marks this school year. instead of grabbing the opportunity to create a better education system, it seems that we are merely trying to extend the life of a dying and outdated system. what i fear the most is that the mistakes in education made during this pandemic will almost certainly worsen the state of our education system, as if it wasn't the worst state before already. students during the pandemic shall continue their education and start their careers being ill-equipped to do so. more and more good teachers will care less and less about what they do - several might even lose their passion for the profession and quit. i want to say a lot more but this post is getting long, so i'll end it with this. philippine education has never been in such a sorry state. and sadly, i can't give you any concrete solutions as of the moment (i have ideas but i'm merely a powerless teacher right now - unable to do any large sweeping changes). however, i still hope for the best. perhaps not now, but one day. it might sound naive to most of you - maybe even plain stupid (maybe it is indeed) - but i'm not one to lose hope in the future. i wouldn't have taken a career that heavily relies on investing in an unseen future if i were someone nihilistic. right now, we'll have to weather through this storm... ... ... but then again, at what cost? edit: uhm, hey everyone. the reception to this has been equally heartbreaking and heartwarming. i just wanted to write another section in this post to encourage everyone to keep going. sa mga kapwa ko guro sa mga komento, maraming salamat sa mga ginagawa niyo para sa mga estudyante natin. i can't offer help to all of you personally, but please know that our efforts aren't in vain and that these efforts are much appreciated by our students (read the comments). please don't forget, though, to take care of yourselves. for our students, i offer my apologies. you are all the ""unintended victims"" of this mess (as one commenter pointed out). but please persevere and rise up amidst the chaos (even if it's easier said than done). i hope you all live good, long and fulfilling lives. sa mga nagpaabot ng kanilang mga ideya (positib o negatib) at lalo sa mga nagbigay ng ideya paano lulutasan ang mga problema natin sa edukasyon, maraming salamat po. thank you for sharing your time with us to discuss your thoughts. please continue elegantly sharing what you know with others. sa mga redditor na nagpaabot ng kanilang pagkakaisa sa mga guro at estudyante sa mga komento at awards - maraming maraming maraming salamat po. your words of encouragement help us keep going. sa inyong lahat na nagbabasa, sana 'wag niyo po kalimutan na mag-laan ng oras para sa inyong mga sarili. it's a crazy world out there, but it's always okay to focus on yourself every now and then.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/jkxry2/from_a_teachers_pov/,30 10 2020

"Ayoko na, pagod na ako.","sobrang gulo ng isip ko. kakagraduate ko lang noong june 5 until now wala pa rin akong mahanap na work. alam ko na at fault din ako kasi 3 lang yung inapplyan ko, pero lately, nawawalan talaga ako ng gana mag-apply. hindi ko mafigure out kung ano yung gusto kong gawin. mga 2nd week ng june, nagtry ako maging ugc creator, failed. recently naman (last week), nagtry ako mag luto ng almusal dito sa amin. kumikita naman kaso pa-100 lang. hindi sapat to cover our living expenses. take note, naka partial live in ako sa boyfriend ko, wala siyang work pero may diskarte siya na easy money kaso yung huling success niya sa diskarte na yun ay noong may 30 pa before ako mag graduation kasi supposedly para sa panghanda ko yung money na yun, although naubos lang din and kinakailangan niya mag sanla ulit para makapag bigay sa graduation ko (na hindi ko naman pinilit). i appreciate it tho kaso recently nasusumbat niya sakin yun. minsan nasasabihan niya ako na wala akong kwenta kasi wala akong pera/wala akong work. i feel like a burden to him, altho wala naman siya masyadong financial problem bukod sa naka sanla lang yung alahas niya at tutubo na this month (yung pangalawang reason bakit nakapag sanla ulit siya ng alahas dahil nangutang ako 2k sa kaniya to do ugc, kaso sinanla niya ng parang 7k o 8k so siya rin nakaubos in short). while ako naman, unemployed pero everyday nakakapag provide ako ng food namin, ako rin nagbabayad ng bills, etc. since last year siguro ako nagshoshoulder ng bills, pero lagi niya sinasabi na hinahatian daw niya ako kahit hindi naman. anyway, so yun na nga nagtitinda ako ng almusal, nagtitiis ako in short. i know that there are a lot of opportunities out there pero nacacalm ako kapag nagluluto ako. altho naprepressure ako kasi parang lahat ng tao dito minamadali ako magkawork especially yung boyfriend ko. today, nakapag tinda ako ng almusal kaso hindi naubos. another incident ng kapalpakan ko, yung requirements na ginawa ko para sa diskarte niya, may mali. sobrang nagalit na naman siya sakin, in the end pinaalis niya ako sa property namin na tinutuluyan niya at pinauwi niya ako sa bahay namin kasi ayaw niya ako makita dahil sa sobrang inis niya dahil sa kabobohan ko. magkalapit lang ung property namin na tinutuluyan niya at yung bahay namin. right now, i feel like shit. hindi ko alam gagawin. hindi naubos paninda ko, palpak yung nagawa ko na requirements, wala pa tumatanggap sa akin na work, wala na kami pera for tomorrow (kahit for later wala rin), at higit sa lahat baon ako sa utang. gusto ko nalang kunin ako ni lord. hindi ko alam gagawin. i mean sige given na mag appy ako, mag ayos ako, pero tangina parang lugmok na lugmok ako to the point na gusto ko nalang mamatay. madalas si mama palagi rin ako sinisigawan o pinapagalitan, tapos pag may narinig na pagalit o pamumuna yung boyfriend ko galing sa mama ko regarding sa akin, gagatungan pa niya. help please help. i'm so close para uninom ulit ng zonrox or ano pa man. madalas gusto ko nalang saksakin sarili ko kasi puro ako kapalpakan, wala pa kwenta, burden, lahat na!!!!!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/14q5s33/ayoko_na_pagod_na_ako/,4 07 2023

Losing friends bc of politics,"i might get downvoted for this but i just rly can’t stand ppl who support bbm and i’ve reached the point where i’m willing to cut ties. i’m surrounded by apologists (both family and friends). i’m from leyte btw, which explains a lot. nalulungkot ako kasi these were my best friends during senior high (we’re in different college universities now). we basically did everything together, studied & got good grades, shared secrets & packed lunches, sneaked out, laughed, cried, even promised to be there at each other’s weddings. we were each other’s support system, and now i’m not so sure anymore. i admit it’s partly my fault because i tend to share a lot of political posts and memes on my account, to the point na nagiging offensive na sa kanila. in my defense, my posts are always based on the truth, but they think it’s all “paninira” and “negative campaigning.” according to them, we should just respect each other’s opinions. one of them also stated that studying in up does not equate to that person being smarter than others who don’t, kasi sa attitude pa rin daw nagmamatter lahat—how you treat and respect people despite their political beliefs. syempre, natamaan ako kasi i’m the only one in our inner circle who entered up. i try to be understanding naman, but sometimes i just lose my shit especially whenever someone redtags me or makes fun of leni sa posts ko, or worst, invalidates the sufferings of martial law victims. this has been going on since the start of the pandemic kasi i was vocal against du30’s pandemic response, in which they implied na puro lang daw ako reklamo. i even got in a heated argument with one of them sa isang post ko which is why dumistansya muna ako. last feb, naging okay ulit kami because i invited them over for my birthday. nag-initiate din ako na walang magtotopic ng politics just so we could just chill and enjoy the day. ngayon, bumabalik nanaman kami sa parinigan via shared posts. di ako nakakapaniwala na they choose to be blind until now. naiinis ako kasi they have the access to information naman, and i believe that it’s every citizen’s responsibility to be socially and politically aware. idk what to do anymore. am i selfish for wanting a different environment? pagod na pagod na ako, walang nakakaintindi sa akin. pati parents ko, dinidismiss lang mga sinasabi ko. ilang araw na akong bigla nalang naiiyak esp with the fact that leni didn’t win + the fear of my future as a comm student in up hahahuhu pls adopt me",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/uof7ge/losing_friends_bc_of_politics/,13 05 2022

My mother's current situation at St. Lukes.,"i really need to ask for everyone's insight/recommendations in this subreddit kasi hindi ko na talaga alam ang gagawin ko sa sitwasyon namin ngaun. initially kasi, ung kapitbahay namin kinumbinse ang mama ko na may diabetes na magpacheck up sa st. lukes kasi wala daw silang binayaran sa pagpapatingin at opera sa kanya dahil may maxicare sya. ako naman pumayag kasi dependent ko si mama sa hmo ko sa work at malaking tulong nga talaga ung walang babayaran. aside from that, naging masama na talaga ung nararamdaman ni mama at gusto na nya magpatingin dahil may sugat sya sa hinliliit nya sa paa at un ang nagcacause ng panghihina nya. fast forward anduon na kami sa office ng doctor at nung pagkakita nya sa paa ng mama ko, minadali na nya kaming ipa admit ang mama ko (note na wala talaga ako masyadong alam about confinement at nataranta na rin ako kaya pumayag na ako ipa admit sya sa st lukes). fast forward ng dalawang araw at naka schedule na si mama for operation sa kanyang paa. kinabukasan ininspect ng surgeon ung paa at merong parts na naging necrotic. minessage ako ng pinsan ko kasi nalaman nya ung nangyari kay mama at ininform ko sa kanya na may confidence pa nga na wala naman kaming babayaran kasi may hmo si mama pero inutusan nya ako na magparunning bill (hindi ko nga alam tong term na ito eh dahil wala talaga akong knowledge about hospitalization). inexplain nya na gawin ko daw un or else magugulat na lang ako sa bill namin. kinabukasan dimiretso ako sa billing department ng hospital at nag request ng soa at putangina nagulat ako dahil sa tatlong araw ng pag stay ni mama sa ospital 300k+ na agad ung bill! natulala ako nun for a good minute at dumiretso ako sa maxicare para magask ng options (kung pwede ipaincrease ung limit or kung pwede ipatong ung limit ko sa limit ng mama ko) pero negative. fast forward sa 2nd operation ni mama at kinabukasan ininspect ulit at may parts ulit na necrotic at duon na kami binigyan ng option na putulin ung paa nya. ang kinaiinis ko pa dito bakit hindi na lang nila inadvise na iamputate in the first place (although ayaw ko naman mangyari un dahil napaka morbid) pero sinabi naman nila na ayaw nila mapunta sa pagputol at itry na isave ung paa as much as possible. i get that pero wala kaming financial capacity na sagutin ung bill. ang intention ko lang naman is mapatingin sya at magkaroon ng mabilis na operation na macocover ng hmo nya pero hindi un ang naging case. fast forward sa present, nakausap ko na ung doctor at sinabi ko na nakapagdecide na kami ng mama ko na putulin na lang ung paa nya para hindi na kumalat pa ung impeksyon at dahil 800k na ung tanginang bill namin. kaya ito ako ngaun humihingi ng recommendation/advice kung anong pwedeng gawin in case hindi masolusyunan ng medical assistance sa government/politicians. base sa mga research ko against the law na magdetain ng patients due to non payment. pero ang magiging loophole nila samin ay ang room namin initially ay private kasi ayun ang sabi ng maxicare na covered nila at wala naman sa isip ko na ilagay kami sa ward dahil mahina ang diskarte ko sa hospital. **tl;dr** ang ineexpect kong free of charge appoinment sa st. lukes ay napunta sa malaginto na bayarin kaya nanghihingi ako ng advice kung ano pwedeng gawin para hindi makulong ang nanay ko sa ospital dahil wala kami pambayad sa bill. edit: nasa ward naman na kami ngaun kaya sana bigyan kami ng consideration despite admitting in a private room initially na inoffer ng maxicare. ***update*** nakausap ko na ung sa billing may pinagusapan kaming options. ang ayaw ko lang naman talaga kasi na mangyari eh idetain kami dito sa hospital dahil hindi kami makakabayad in full. payag naman ako sa installment plan pero wala daw ganung option. sinabi ko naman ung storya ko na napaagree lang naman kami sa st lukes dahil inassure ng kapitbahay na wala naman kaming gagastusin and kasi akala ko saglit lang si mama duon at simple lang ung operation pero nagtagal sya at lumobo na ung bill. i expected na macocover lahat ng charges gamit ung hmo ng mama ko pero hindi pala. so ayun tinanong nya sakin na kinonsider ko daw ba na lumipat sa ibang hospital. sinabi ko nasa isip ko naman un pero ano ba ung magiging process? kailangan ba bayaran muna ung bill dito bago malipat? wala syang dinisclose duon kasi ung management nya lang daw ung makakapag decide. so nung narinig ko un medj gumaan ung loob ko dahil parang may loophole. so tinanong ko ano po ba ung magiging repercussions kapag lumipat ako ng hospital at hindi ko mababayaran ung bill sa st lukes which is hindi naman talaga kaya. sabi nya possible na mangyari is ma-ban kami sa st lukes. edi ok lang. wala naman talaga kami mababayad kahit pigain nila kami at kahit anong gagawin nilang pagdetain samin lolobo lang ung amount ng bill na hindi namin mababayaran. kaya kung i restrict/ban nila kami due to non payment edi go. hindi ko naman ginusto na pumunta sa st lukes balak ko naman talaga is sa pgh or kahit anong government hospital. sadyang nakumbinse lang ng kapitbahay.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/y1b76n/my_mothers_current_situation_at_st_lukes/,11 10 2022

What does Albularyo do (witch doctor/folk healer)? Do they really do something? May naniniwala pa ba sa kanila in this generation?,"so i have a brother, he's 25 year old. we rushed him twice in the hospital this week. pero prior pa sa mga episodes na'to, he's feeling symptoms already eg. tightness of chest, nagka-cramps ang katawan niya, difficulty sleeping, nahihirapan huminga, etc. after all the medical exams, okay naman lahat ng results niya, normal lahat ng test. a friend of his advised him to go to albularyo (which i am against kasi i think he's having mental health problems talaga which affects he's overall being since yung mga symptoms niya ay linked to anxiety and depression eg. panic attacks/difficulty breathing). but i just let them para sa peace of mind na rin na atleast we all did everything possible kahit na talagang kapos kami, we just don't want him to feel na pinapabayaan namin siya. so fastforward kung saan pumunta yung albularyo sa bahay, wala naman siyang masyadong ginawa. may sinabi na may lumalaro raw sa kapatid ko (nangkukulam daw sa kanya), mas marami pa actually yung pagboboast niya na he's done something for someone, na siya yung reason kung bakit nalaman kung sino yung kumuha sa wallet ng isa niyang pasyente (?). he's just engaging us in the conversation. he also said na yung mga ibibigay niyang papakuluan at iinumin ay exported pa raw and such. and to my surprise p4000 lahat yung siningil niya for that session only. he's not the typical albularyo rin, naka-car siya and mukha namang well-off. do you think reasonable yun as bayad? i mean, may mga naririnig naman na akong albularyo before pero usually hindi ganun kalaki ang hinihingi nila. since parang act of altruism yon in their part since meron silang god-given gift. i don't have anything against sa mga albularyo or naniniwala/nagpeperform nga mga ganoong rituals pero i felt robbed for me and sa kuya ko kasi we chipped in sa bayad. malaking bagay na yon para samin, he's living paycheck to paycheck and i'm still reviewing for my boards so big deal talaga yun sakin. and if ever may magtanong kung bakit hindi ko na lang sinuggest na magvisit ng psychologist. it is still not acknowledge sa amin, especially sa pamilya namin. and simply not accessible. (how can i put it into words) parang still stuck sa phase na ""nasa isip mo lang yan."" bottomline, are albularyos a thing? am i just overreacting sa bayad? edit: i'm reading all your comments guys and i really appreciate them. pero hindi ko lahat ma-process right now kasi my manung just talked to the albularyo, and he's asking him 5k kasi may ritual daw silang gagawin bukas and he's gonna bathe him with god knows what and how, at hindi pa sure kung yun na yung last na hihingin niya. and he assured him daw na 'pag 'di gumaling, ibabalik daw yung binayad. i really can't process anything right now kasi i'm thinking na baka this is only the beginning nung mga paghingi hingi niya, and knowing my brother he really won't listen to any of us. edit: please don't share this with any platform update: i took your advice guys and told him na he should instead see a therapist since malaking bagay yung hinihinging 5k. i also forwarded informative videos na very similar sa mga symptoms na nafifeel niya na linked to anxiety. unfortunately, umutang daw siya ng pambayad and binayaran na niya. and he won't acknowledge yung idea na maybe he has anxiety. sobrang close minded niya with regards doon. i'll just hope and pray for the placebo effect.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/17nhpid/what_does_albularyo_do_witch_doctorfolk_healer_do/,4 11 2023
Paano kayo nagccope up sa pagkawala ng mahal ninyo sa buhay?,"it's been 2 weeks since my father died. sobrang bilis, ang lakas niya pa lang tapos bigla na lang siyang nastroke. sabi ng doctor niya makakauwi na siya, pero yung day na dapat uuwi na siya ang day ng libing niya. hanggang ngayon, hindi pa rin mawala sa isip ko kung may pagkukulang ang mga doctor ni papa. doctor ni papa na cardiologist ang humawak sa case niya, nadiagnose siya ng hemorrhagic stroke, pumutok ang ugat sa utak niya at kailangan pigilan ang pagkalat ng dugo. sobrang confident namin sa doc ni papa kasi sabi magaling daw, ang sabi after 5 days ic-ct scan ulit si papa. ang lakas ni papa kahit nung 1-2 days niya sa icu. inaalis niya pa ngt sa ilong niya and malikot ang left side niya though hindi niya magalaw ang right side ng katawan niya at hindi namin siya makausap. 3rd day ni papa sa icu, sinabihan siya ng doctor niya na makakalabas na siya ng icu ng thursday (saturday ng madaling araw na stroke si papa at nadala namin siya agad sa ospital). at sabi, saturday makakauwi na siya sa amin. ayan ang advise ng doc niya sa amin bago umalis ang doc ni papa at nagseminar o may pinuntahan sa ibang bansa at iniwan sa isang doc na iternist. that day, nanghina si papa. ang dating malakas na grip na kamay niya at malikot niyang paggalaw ay humina... akala namin okay na... sobrang taranta na namin at late na na may nakapagsabi sa amin na kakilala na bakit walang neurologist si papa. kailangan daw niya neuro. late rin namin nalaman na cardio and internist doctors lang humahawak kay papa. before that, tanong na kami nang tanong sa mga nurses. nagtanong pa kami bakit hindi pa ict-scan si papa dahil nanghina siya. ang sabi, hindi na raw kailangan daw lalabas na siya. binawasan din mga gamot niya. kaso ang sabi nagka-infection daw siya sa dugo dahil hindi mawala ang lagnat niya kay binigyan siya ng antibiotics. thursday nang malaman namin na walang neuro si papa at kailangan niya ng neuro. pinilit namin na ipatingin si papa sa neuro kahit na nagagalit na samin mga nurses. cardio raw ang kailangan ni papa at hindi neuro. pinapirma kami ng waiver na kami ang nag-ask for neuro at hindi ang doctor ni papa. turns out, nang icheck siya ng neuro bakit daw hindi na-ct scan agad. dapat 2-3 days na ct scan daw ulit para malaman kung namaga utak ni papa. mali pa raw ang antibiotics na ibinibigay kay papa, sobrang baba raw dapat daw malakas dahil sa utak nga daw ang problema ni papa. thursday night, bumagsak katawan ni papa. ang gcs niya from 10 nang dinala namin siya sa ospital to 3. kumalat na daw ang dugo sa utak ni papa as per result ng ct scan sabi ng neuro niya baka kailanganin niya ng surgery. that night, sobrang bumaba bp niya, naging abnormal heartbeat niya at super nahirapan siyang huminga nilagyan na siya ng tube. super sakit akala namin makakauwi na siya tapos friday ng madaling araw nawala na siya. super sakit, before siya mastroke pinag-uusapan pa lang namin graduation ko. sabi niya super proud siya sa amin magkakapatid. ngayon hindi na niya ako makikitang ggraduate....yung panganay niya, walang tatay sa graduation. hindi ko alam kung may pagkukulang mga doctors niya or what, until now di pa rin namin nassettle ang bill. ang hirap magsalita kasi di naman kami expert pero para sa akin may pagkukulang sila. hindi ko sila sinisisi pero ang sama-sama ng loob ko!!! may times na parang okay na, pero kapag naaalala ko si papa... ang sakit-sakit, sobrang miss ko na siya. sobrang miss ko na ang papa ko. unang anak niya na mapapagraduate niya ng college, hindi niya makikita... kahit na mahirap, pinag-aaral niya kaming apat. ang sakit-sakit pa rin... hindi ko alam paano magccope up sa pagkawala ni papa...",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/14hwjjn/paano_kayo_nagccope_up_sa_pagkawala_ng_mahal/,24 06 2023

Tagalized Story.,"may story ako. ako lang ang nag-iisang babae sa pinag-tatrabahuhan kong kumpanya at alam ko na kung bakit. isa akong fresh graduate sa kolehiyo at gusto ko na talagang makapag-simula ng career agad-agad na walang kinalaman sa pagse-serve ng pagkain, pagpupunas ng mga gamit, o pag-dadala o timpla ng kape sa isang matandang negosyante. sa naka-sanayan nag-aapply ako sa trabaho na may anim na araw na trabaho at marami-rami na rin akong interview na napagdaanan. alam ko na ang tinapos kong hrm na kurso ay hindi gaanong makaka-kuha ng magandang oportunidad, pero naniniwala pa rin ako na may mas maganda pang trabaho na naghihintay sa akin. kaya naman nanatili akong positibo, matyaga, at nag-aapply lang sa mga office jobs na may magandang benipisyo. kahit halos wala na akong mapag-kunan ng makakain dahil sa magastos na mga interview, at least mapapag-tibay naman nito ang kakaunting pride na natitira sa akin. halos tatlong linggo na rin ang nakalipas, may isa akong phone interview sa isang internet security company. ang kumpanyang iyon ay maraming offices sa amin at naghahanap sila ng bagong customer support specialist para sa kanilang international department. ang mga requirements ay maganda o mahinahon na boses, good spoken and written grammar, kakaunting tech-knowledge, at may kakayahang mag-trabaho sa umaga at gabi. ang office ay dalawang sakay lang sa mula sa amin, at mayroon silang magandang offer sa health insurance. nag-aapply ako kahit lmitado lang din ang alam ko sa computer science. naging maayos naman ang phone interview at matapos ang dalawang meetings sa hr at sa management, binigyan nila ako ng isang napaka-gandang offer (kahit na wala pa talaga akong experience sa kahit anong trabaho). sa loob ng unang linggo ko, kailangan kong magtrabaho nang regular shift na 9-5 (am) para maging online ako kasabay ng manager ko, na nag-trabaho sa ibang branch ng kumpanya. pagkatapos noon ay kailangan kong magtrabaho para sa regular na schedule ko bilang support - ang schedule ko ay 6 na araw na pasok (09:00 am -05:00 pm (am) at may isang araw na night shift 09:00 pm - 05:00 am respectively). sa unang araw ko, ang suot ko ay isang loose na sweater at mahabang skirt. bilang sa kaalaman ko ay sa ganitong uri ng trabaho ay karamihan mga lalaki ang empleyado, ayaw ko naman mag-cause ng unnecessary attention dahil sa provocatively o inappropriately pag-susuot ng hindi naayon na attire. ang lalaki sa front desk ay mukha namang maayos na tao. pinakilala n'ya ang sarili n'ya bilang si andrew bago n'ya ako tulungang mag-fill out ng mga paperwork at sinamahan n'ya na ako sa aking mesa at sa isang open space na workspace. nakatitig lang ako sa tila walang katapusang mga desks habang naglalakad kami, napansin ko na halos hindi mo makikita ang mga mukha ng bawat taong nagta-trabaho na naka-upo sa bawat desks. wala man lang akong nakita o napansin na babae habang nag-lalakad kami sa tila baga'y walang katapusang workspace na iyon, na talaga namang hindi normal at nakaka-bahala. kahit ang kalmadong presensya ni andrew ay hindi kayang maiwaglit ang wari kakaibang pakiramdam na naka-tuon sa akin. halos maubusan ako ng hininga ng maramdaman ko ang mga presensya ng bagong kong co-workers na tila nagsasabi na ""hindi ka nababagay dito"". nagulat ako ng biglang huminto si andrew sa isang desk na napuno ng mga printed memes, floral stickers, at isang lumang keychain na naka-patong sa harap ng monitor. bukod pa doon ay natatakpan na rin ng makapal na alikabok ang keyboard, monitor at ang natitirang ispasyo ng desk. ""ahhh... anong nangyari..."" sabi ni andrew sa medyo upset na boses. ""pasensya ka na."" sabi nito habang nakatingin sa aking mga papeles. ""ah... aya. dapat matagal na 'tong nalinis. kailangan kong maka-usap ang custodian"". ""ok lang 'yun"", sagot ko. ""puwede ko namang punasan na lang 'yan, wala namang problema"". medyo asiwa na noon si andrew, pero habang ginagala ko ang aking paningin ay malinaw na wala ng ibang bakanteng desk maliban doon. mabilis na natapos ang araw na iyon. natutunan ko na ang mga dapat kung gawin na sumagot sa support related phone calls at gumawa ng bagong ticket para sa system. kailangan ko ring i-monitor ang lahat ng pumapasok na chats at written tickets at isaayos ito base sa level ng urgency at type nito. hindi naman ako required mag-bigay ng technical advice, pero dapat maging pamilyar ako sa aming product software. bilang wala pa namang mga tawag ay pinaki-alaman ko muna ang manual. halos wala akong maintindihan sa mga naroon kaya naman ginogle ko na lang ang karamihan na nasa manual. kinumusta ako noon ng manager ko at mukhang hindi s'ya masaya sa mga lapses ko sa mga materials. dahil pakiramdam ko wala akong matinong nagawa at gagawin sa mga oras na iyon ay panandalian akong nag-break para linisin ang mesa ko. tumayo ako para tanungin si andrew kung saan makaka-kuha ng basahan para sa mesa ko. agad-agad kong pinagsisihan ang desisyon kong iyon. ang bawat mata sa kwarto ay tila napako sa pagtayo ko sa aking kinauupuan. hindi ako sigurado pero maraming mga bulungan akong narinig habang papalayo ako sa aking mesa. ang kaninang maingay na mga keyboard ay pahina nang pahina na halos kainin na ako ng lupa sa sobrang hindi ko pagiging kumportable at self-conscious na rin at the same time. napansin ko na lang na halos halikan ko na ang dibdib ko sa pagyuko para lang hindi ako mapansin. bago ako maka-rating sa isang palikong daan patungo sa front desk ay buong-lakas kong tinignan ang isang tila walang hiyang lalaki na nakatitig sa akin. hindi ko alam kung ano ang inaasahan ko, pero 'yung overall appearance ng lalaking naka-hooding pang-asar na 'yun ay nagbigay ng matinding kilabot sa buong katawan ko. siguro mga ka-edad ko s'ya pero hindi man lang s'ya nahiya o natinag sa pagkaka-titig n'ya sa akin sa kabila ng pagtitig ko sa kanya na may halong pagka-bwisit at inis. isang kakila-kilabot na ngiti ang sumilaw sa mga labi nito habang naka-titig sa parteng bukong-bukong ng aking mga paa at dahan-dahan itong bumalik sa kanyang monitor. inisip ko kung anong magiging reaksyon n'ya kapag tinitigan ko rin ng kaparehong paraan ng pagtitig n'ya sa akin ang tinitigyawat n'yang leeg. parehong reaksyon pa rin ang nakuha ko habang naglalakad ako pabalik sa aking mesa kasama ang box ng computer wipes sa mga kamay ko. may maganda ring nangyari sa araw na iyon. habang nililinis ko ang mga drawer ng mesa ko ay may nakita akong half-used notebook mula sa nakaraang nagta-trabaho sa mesa ko. hindi n'ya nilagay ang first name n'ya, kundi initial lang at last name: j. espiritu. pero, base sa dekorasyon ng notebook, sigurado ako na babae rin s'ya kagaya ko. ang mga naiwan n'yang gamit ay nagbigay ng kapanatagan sa akin, pero 'yung notebook ang talagang pumukaw ng atensyon ko. doon ay sinabi nito ang pina-ikli at simpleng manual gamit ang easy-to-undertand terms at mga explenasyon sa nakaka-litong terminolohiya at komplikadong panuto sa manual. sa tulong n'ya ay nasurpresa ko ang aking manager sa aking product knowledge pagkatapos ng shift ko. matapos ang isang magandang araw ay buong tapang akong gumala sa office at nag-explore sa pantry. binenta ni andrew sa akin ang top-notch coffee machine at snacks sa nasabing pantry, tutal nagugutom na rin naman ako matapos ang isang emotionally, intellectually and productive na araw na 'yun. (ansabe). tsaka, medyo butas na rin 'yung bulsa at namumula na ang mga credit cards ko, kaya naman ayos na ako sa ilang pirasong masasarap na cookies. habang papalapit ako ay may narinig akong malakas na usapan at tawanan sa pantry. sa katangahan ko ay inisip ko na baka naman mas mainit, friendly o kahit maka-tao na sila sa akin. subalit ang maliit na pantry ay napuno ng katahimikan the moment na pumasok ako sa pantry. may limang lalaki doon na mag-kakaiba ang edad at lalaki na naka-upo sa palibot ng isang maliit na lamesa, at lahat sila ay naka-titig na direkta sa akin. ""panget na araw?"" - tugon ng isang pang-asar na boses. agad kong itinaas ang ulo ko mula sa pagkaka-titig sa sahig para hanapin ang pinag-mulan ng boses. hindi naging mahirap sa aking hanapin at malaman na mula iyon sa naka-hoodie na walang-hiyang tumitig sa akin nung nakaraan lang. ""siguro marami ka ng experience?"" - sambit pa nito sa nakaka-asar na tono at may-unting pag-taas ng kilay. ""para makakuha ng komportableng trabaho. siguro sikat ka?"". ""ano 'to, high-school?"" - sagot ko sa malakas na boses. hindi ko hilig kumompronta ng tao, pero sobra na 'to. hostility is one thing, social awkwardness is another, pero pakiramdam ko isa 'tong 80's na high-school drama na mga trenta anyos ang mga bida bilang mga teenagers. ""nandito lang ako para kumuha kape at kung may problema ka sa trabaho ko, puwede mong dalhin sa hr kung ano man ang issue mo"". nagpatuloy ako habang ine-enjoy ang namumutla at pahiyang mukha ng mga taong 'yun. mabuti naman, gusto kong maramdaman nila ang katiting na discomfort na buong araw kung kinakaharap. pinili kong lumayo sa aking mga co-workers, naglakad ako ng taas noo pabalik sa mesa ko na may hawak-hawak na tasa ng kape. bago pa ako maka-upo at enjoyin ang masarap na kape, napansin kong may isang mensahe galing sa hindi kilalang number: ""you have quite an attitude, don't you?"" nanigas ako habang hawak ang cell phone sa isa kong kamay at kape sa kabila. habang prino-proseso ko ang tila breach sa personal security ko, naka-tanggap ulit ako ng dalawa pang mensahe. isa ay ang hubo't-hubad kong katawan na sinend ko sa una kong serious college boyfriend. ang pangalawa: ""bakit hindi mo ngayon ibigay 'yang picture sa hr?"" sa totoo lang, sobrang naapektuhan ako sa invasion ng privacy ko. pumasok ang kahihiyan sa akin at sobrang naiinis ako for drawing so much unwanted attention sa sarili ko. kasalanan ko lahat 'to. pumasok ako sa isang office na puno ng ethical hackers na may pare-parehong pangalan ng aso bilang password. walang duda na ang litratong iyon ay umiikot na sa buong office at lahat ng iyon ay salamat sa walang hiyang ka-trabaho ko, at isa na akong kakatuwang tao sa loob ng office. hindi ko na ginalaw ang kape ko at umuwi na lang, habang pinipigilan ko ang bawat emosyon na bumuhos hanggang makarating ako sa safety ng bahay. halos hindi ako matigil sa kaiiyak nung gabing 'yun, iniisip ko na ang mga mukha ng mga ka-trabaho ko habang tigang na tigang na nakatitig sa hubad kong katawan. mga alas tres na ng madaling araw, doon ko lang na-realize na wala ng kwenta para pa magpaka-lunod ako sa kahihiyan. kailangan kong gumawa ng plano para maka-survive sa ganitong uri ng workplace. quitting is not an option kasi masyadong malaki ang pasweldo nila para tumigil ako. tsaka, halos tinapay na lang ang kaya kong bilhin sa araw-araw. ang pangalawa kong option ay pumunta sa hr, but there's no way i was going to open that can of worms. hindi ko mapapatunayan kong sino talaga ang nag-send ng mga mensahe na iyon. last option? stick with it, keep my head down, gawin ang trabaho na pinasukan ko at 'wag pansinin ang iba pang mga harassment na gagawin nila. 'yun nga ang ginawa ko. sa kabuuan ng isang linggong training ko ay pumapasok ako on time, hindi ako umaalis sa desk ko liban na lang kung pupunta sa palikuran. iniwasan ko rin ang kahit anong contact kanino man at pinanatili ko lang ang aking mga mata sa mga inanimate objects. salamat kay j. espiritu, palagi akong on top ng training ko. sa bawat bagong task na galing sa manager ko, laging may katumbas na entry sa kanyang notebook. wala ng nakaka-gagong texts at face-to-face na kumprontasyon, pero mayroong kakatuwang pakiramdam na panibagong sisira sa kalagayan ko. sa darating na biyernes na ang huling training ko, na nagdala sa akin sa huling entry sa notebook. night shift survival guide: - matulog sa buong umaga bago ang shift at 'wag na 'wag kang matutulog. - walang sino man ang dapat maka-pasok. - panatilihing may pepper spray na dala. (sa kahit anong sitwasyon). - i-check ang bawat aisle, meeting rooms. huwag kalimutang i-check ang ilalim ng lamesa, balkonahe, kitchen tables at kahit likod ng cooler. - laging mag-open ng skype na naka-ready sa emergency in case na hindi gumana ang mobile services. - panatilihing updated sa kaibigan/pamilya/lover kada oras. ang nasabing listahan ay medyo may kahulugan. una, sabi ng hr puwede naman akong matulog sa pagitan ng 2-5 am, basta malapit palagi sa akin ang office smartphone. mayroon nga silang pull out couch sa isang conference room para lang talaga sa ganitong sitwasyon. pangalawa, ang buong shift ay phone calls, kaya palaging may paraan para maka-tawag mula sa office phone, tama? lastly, ang mga naka-outlined sa ""guide"" ay parang o.a at paranoid. siguro 'yung listahan ay satirical? (ewan ko). siguro si espiritu parehas kami ng pakiramdam tungkol sa mga tila patay gutom na mga asong cold-blooded na co-workers? pero 'yung isip ko nag-tatrabaho ng sobra-sobra para makita ang logic sa likod ng mga pag-iingat na ito. may kakatuwa akong pakiramdam na may importanteng impormasyon akong hindi nalalaman. lahat 'yun iniisip ko habang paalis ako ng bahay nung biyernes na 'yun, last day ng training ko. ""andrew"", - dahan-dahan akong lumapit sa kanya. ""puwede ba mag-tanong?"" ""sure thing"", - sagot n'ya na may maaliwalas na ngiti sa kanyang mga labi. ""nagtataka lang ako, bakit wala akong nakikitang ibang support agents. i mean, 'di ba dapat merong at least lima pang tao para ma-cover 'yung six-day rotation cycle?"" ""kailangan mong tanungin ang manager mo tungkol d'yan. most likely naka-kalat sila sa iba pang branch sa syudad. normal lang naman 'yun sa ganoong kaso"", - sagot n'ya. pakiramdam ko tapos na kami sa diskusyon na 'yun matapos s'yang bumalik sa final tasks n'ya para sa linggong iyon. ""meron bang ibang agent na nag-trabaho dito liban sa akin?"" - pagpapatuloy ko, dahil ganun na lamang ang kagustuhan kong malaman ang iba pang detalye sa babaeng nag-fill out ng notebook na s'ya namang ginagamit ko sa buong linggong iyon. ""oo, may isang babae na humawak sa posisyon mo ng panandalian"", - ani ni andrew, habang naka-titig pa rin sa screen ng kanyang screen. pero napansin kong tumigil na s'ya sa pag-tatype o pag-galaw ng mouse. wari ko ay naka-titig lang s'ya sa iisang spot sa monitor n'ya. ""andrew"", - nag-salubong ang mga kilay ko. ""sino 'yung nag-trabaho malapit sa main working space na talagang nakaka-inis? maputla, medyo payat, maitim at kulot na buhok?"" - tanong ko, habang nagpapaikot ng daliri sa bandang ulunan ko para i-describe ang pagkaka-kulot ng nasabing lalake. ""ah... si michael"", - sagot nito, napansin nito ang pagiging iritable ng boses ko. ""may problema ba? ginugulo ka ba n'ya?"" ""hindi"" - sagot ko, pero sa isip-isip ko ay nagtatalo na ang emosyon at sarili ko. ""have a good weekend, andrew"" ""ikaw din"", - sagot nito, halata na may pagtataka sa boses nito habang papaalis ako. sa buong weekend na 'yun ay binabalik-balikan ko ang mga nangyari sa akin sa unang linggo ko. pakiramdam ko may hindi sinasabi si andrew sa akin na importante. wala namang rason para maging iretable s'ya nung nabanggit ko 'yung babaeng nag-trabaho bago ako. may nag-reklamo na kaya kay michael dati? pu-puwede kayang si j. espiritu? si michael ba ang dahilan ng survival guide sa notebook? bakit s'ya umalis? napaka-daming teorya ang bumagabag sa buong weekend ko. bago ko pa nalaman, oras na para bumalik sa trabaho. ito ang araw na talagang sobrang daming trabaho. kahapon ay lunes, ang unang regular day shift. mabilis lang dumaan ang nasabing araw, habang aligaga ako sa pag-sagot ng tawag, recording, sorting at assigning ng dose-dosenang customer complaints sa system namin. hindi sapat ang salitang nasanay na ako at pagkatapos ng araw na 'yun ay sobrang pagod at ubos na ako. saktong maglo-logout na ako, naka-tanggap na naman ako ng mensahe mula sa hindi kilalang number. ""ang sipag mo naman. hindi na ako makapag-hintay na mag night shift ka"" seryoso?! ito ang kauna-unahang mensahe na bumalot sa buong pagkatao ko ng takot. agad-agad kong ginala ang paningin ko kung nasa paligid ba si michael para kumprontahin ko s'ya sa pagse-send ng mensahe, pero kanina pa pala s'ya umalis. matapos kong pakalmahin ang sarili ko, umuwi na ako at sinusubukan kong hanapin si j. espiritu online. ang pinaka best bet ko noon ay sa linkedin, at doon nga ay sinusubukan kong galugarin ang buong listahan ng mga babae na may kinalaman sa proficient technologies na naka-lagay sa profile nila (halos kakaunti lang talaga sila). nung wala akong makita ay pumunta ako kay andrew at doon nga sa friend list n'ya ay sa wakas nakita ko na ang hinahanap ko. may babae na pangalan ay jennah espiritu at unemployed ang status. nag-send ako ng friend request na may mensahe na nag-papakilala at tinanong ko s'ya kung hinarass ba s'ya ng isa n'yang ka-trabaho. sa wakas, pakiramdam ko may patutunguhan na ako, natulog ako at inihanda ang sarili para sa bukas na event. naisip ko na baka may kakaibang mangyayari dahil sa pagbabago ng schedule nung natulog ako ng miyerkules. nag-check ako ng linkedin halos pagka-gising ko mga ala una. walang kahit anong sign kay jennah, kaya naman natulog ulit ako para makapag-handa sa night shift. medyo kinakabahan ako at excited at the same time kasi puwede ko ng mas malibot ang buong place of work ko intimately. dahil walang day crowd, malaya akong makaka-gala at ma-eenjoy ang cookies, dumura sa baso ni michael, kahit ano! may mga iilan pa ring mga nag-tatrabaho nung dumating ako para sa shift ko, pero hindi ko naman iyon pinansin at dahil sa nag-uumapaw na mga tawag at chats na aasikasuhin. makalipas ang dalawang oras, ang bugso ng mga tawag at chats pati mga tickets ay unti-unting bumagal hanggang tuluyan na nga itong tumigil ng sabay-sabay halos alas onse na ng gabi noon. sumandal ako sa kinauupuan ko at ginala-gala ang mga paningin sa aking workspace. wala ng tao noon sa office at least sa nakikita ko. naka-bukas ang lahat ng ilaw pero nung tinanggal ko ang headphones ko, may narinig akong mahinang jingling melody sa hindi kalayuan. para s'yang christmas carol, pero hirap akong tukuyin kong saan ito nangga-galing. wala namang dahilan para matakot ako sa pangyayari, pero pakiramdam ko ang mga nagtayuang balahibo sa mga kamay ko ay nagsilbing alarm. nang tumayo ako sa aking kinauupuan, nawala 'yung melody. well, naging paranoid na ako dati. minsan ko ng inisip na na may lalaking sumusunod sa akin isang gabi hanggang nilagpasan n'ya ako at nagtungo sa kalapit na tindahan sa 'di kalayuan. kahit mag-isa lang ako, lagi kong dino-double at triple check ang mga lock ng bahay bago matulog. aaminin ko na ang mga takot ko ay wala naman talagang basehan. mayroong naka-iwan ng headphones na konektado pa rin sa computer nito at naka-on ang music. o siguro may office party sa ibang kumpanya sa baba ng building. ang makarinig ng kanta ay nakaka-takot lamang sa mga kakatuwang horror movies, 'di ba? 'di ba?! para maka-siguro, hinalughog ko ang office para maka-siguro na mag-isa na nga lang ako. habang naglalakad sa gitna ng mga magkaka-dikit na desks, naisip ko kung gaano ako ka-swerte na mayroon akong sariling corner spot. hindi ko siguro kakayanin na mapalapit sa kahit sinong mga hindi kaaya-aya kong mga co-workers. matapos ko ma-check ang bawat rows ay dumiretcho ako sa front desk area at nagmamasid sa mga kagamitan ni andrew sa paghahanap ng clues. nung wala akong makitang clues ay bumalik ako sa main room ng pantry. unti-unti ng mas nagiging relaxed ang mga senses ko at tsaka ko lang napag-tanto na napasarap ata ang taste-testing ko sa mga cookies sa halip na mag-hanap ng mga kahina-hinalang mga bagay. kailangan ko ng tumigil sa kaka-kain ng cookies, pero dahil bumalik na naman ang kaninang tunog na naririnig ko, mas malakas s'ya ngayon. at the same time, ang work smartphone ko (na kinakailangan dala-dala namin kung aalis kami sa aming work station) tumunog at may mensahe mula sa hindi na namang kilalang number. so, nag-eenjoy ka ba sa cookies, ha? nanigas ang buong katawan ko habang prino-proseso ng utak ko ang mga pangyayari. siguro hindi talaga umalis ng office si michael at ngayon tinatakot ako. kinalikot ko ang tenga ko noon at nakinig ng maigi. walang kahit sino sa pantry as least sa nakikita at naririnig ko. tsaka, kung si michael ay nasa main workspace, hindi naman ganun kahirap na hulaan o sabihin na kumakain ako ng cookies. habang dahan-dahan akong humihinga, hindi ko muna pinansin ang tunog at nakinig ako ng maigi kung may iba pa akong tunog na maririnig. wala. dahan-dahan, naglakad ako sa may pantry drawers at doon may nakita akong malaking kutsilyo. alam ko bang gumamit ng kutsilyo? hindi. kaya ko kayang paalisin kung sino man ang unarmed na kalaban? syempre. papunta na sana ako pabalik sa aking work station ng biglang may tawag na pumasok mula sa work phone. ipinosisyon ko ang sarili ko ng kumportable sa pader ng pantry, kutsilyo sa kanang kamay, cell phone sa kabila, bago pa ako maka-sagot with the standard customer support greeting. nag static na sa kabilang linya at iba pang ingay sunod ang tuluyang pagka-putol ng linya at katahimikan. nung tinignan ko ang cell phone, nakita kong naka-patay na ito. sinubukan kong buksan ulit ito, pero hindi na ito gumagana. ok, ngayon kailangan ko ng bumalik sa computer ko in case na may pumasok pang mga tawag. naalala ko bigla ang isa sa mga guide na galing kay jennah habang isinusuksok ko ang walang kwentang cell phone sa bulsa ko. - laging mag-open ng skype na naka-ready sa emergency in case na hindi gumana ang mobile services. nangyari rin kaya 'to sa kanya? ang mga instructions sa notebook ay unti-unti ng nagkaroon ng kahulugan, at minumura ko ang sarili ko dahil sa pagiging tanga. sa oras na lumabas ang mga salita sa bibig ko ay may isa na namang mensahe ang dumating sa cell phone. kinuha ko iyon at sinubukang i-unlock, pero 'yung regular home screen ay hindi lumalabas. ang lumabas lang ay isang white screen na may maikling text. putang ina. ang mga babae dapat hindi ginagamit ng ganung mga uri ng salita. matapos kong mabasa 'yun ay nawala na ito sa screen at may panibagong text ang lumabas. bakit hindi ka lumabas at makipag-laro? huwag mo ng isiping bitbitin pa 'yang kutsilyong hawak mo. wala ring magagawa 'yan sa hawak kong baril. tinapon ko ang cell phone ko sa lapag at agad-agad ay nagtungo ako sa aking computer. ang tunog ay mas lalong lumakas habang papalapit ako sa aking lamesa, doon ay nakita kong may isang baboy na stuffed toy. may fabric button ito sa bandang paanan at music note na kasama. dito nagmumula ang tunog at nagpapatunay lamang na hindi ako mag-isa at may kung sino akong kasama. ang malala pa, pinapanood nila ang bawat galaw ko at sinusubukang takutin gamit ang mga laruang pambata. unti-unti ng dumadaloy ang pagpapanic sa aking buong katawan at naghahanda na sa fight or flight scenario. huminga ako ng malalim, sinusubukan kong pakalmahin ang buong katawan ko. so far wala pa naman akong naririnig ng kahit anong palatandaan na may ibang tao sa loob ng office. may mga background noises galing sa syudad sa labas at ang mga ingay mula sa naka-limutang patayin na computer ng isang employee. kung sino man ang gumagawa nito sa akin, kailangan kong malaman ang kanilang eksaktong lokasyon para maplano ko ng maayos ang pag-takas ko. isa pa, kailangan kong maka-kuha ng tulong sa lalong mas madaling panahon. habang iginigilid ko ang laruan ay umupo na ako sa aking upuan at pinull-up ang skype for business application. mabilis akong nag-dial ng 911, habang naka-loudspeaker ang telepono. tumunog na nga ang dial tone at agad-agad ay may live operator na sa kabilang linya. ibibigay ko na sana ang mga hindi kanais-nais na pangyayari sa akin ng mga oras na iyon ng may biglang humawak sa bukong-bukong ko mula sa ilalim ng lamesa. halos maubos ang buong lakas ko sa pagsigaw habang nagpu-pumiglas ang mga paa at mabilis na tumakbo sa abot ng aking makakaya sa bilis na hindi ko akaling kaya ko. may narinig akong kung anong kumusyon sa aking likuran habang tumakbo, kasunod ng isang malakas ng putok, na inisip ko na lamang na galing sa kung ano o sino man ang humahabol sa akin. bago ko pa malaman ay halos nasa ground floor na ako papunta sa pinto lagpas sa gwardiya na halatang nagulat sa mga nangyayari. ang malamig na hangin ay mabilis na pumasok sa manipis kong sweater habang papalapit ako sa isang malapit na pedestrian para humingi ng tulong. tumawag sila ng 911 at ang mga pulis ay agad namang dumating wala pang sampung minuto. habang naghihintay ako kasama ang gwardiya para sa kanilang pag-dating, hindi maalis sa isip ko ang sinulat ni jennah na warning, at kung gaano ako ka-tanga para ipagsa walang bahala ang mga ito. - i-check ang ang bawat aisle, meeting room. huwag kalimutang i-check ang ilalim ng lamesa, balkonahe, kitchen tables at kahit likod ng cooler. agad-agad namang sinulat ng pulis ang mga nangyari sa akin at iniwan ako kasama ang isang pulis officer, umakyat s'ya para i-check ang office. wala namang naka-labas-masok sa building mula nung tumakbo ako palabas, kaya malaki ang posibilidad na naroroon pa rin ang salarin at nagtatago sa loob. sa pag-iisip ay halos bumaliktad ang buong sikmura ko at mas lalo akong lumapit sa may armas kong kasama. maya-maya pa matapos kaming iwanan ng mga pulis, ang kasama kong pulis ay nag-radyo at isa-isa may mga boses na nagpapa-palit-palit sa radyo na humingi ng backup at nga mga codes na hindi ko maintindihan. mabilis na nag-escalate ang mga sumunod na pangyayari. imbis na pauwi ay dinala nila ako sa police station at doon ay nanatili ako sa isang interrogation room ng halos 2 oras bago pa sa wakas may dalawang pulis officer ang kumausap sa akin. pagod na ako noon, miserable ang kalagayan at higit sa lahat litong-lito sa kung papaano naganap ang mga pangyayari. gusto ko ng umuwi pero nanatili pa ako ng ilang oras para i-kuwento ang mga pangyayari sa dalawang pulis officer. 'ahh... meron kang kutsilyong hawak habang tumakbo ka galing sa pantry papunta sa lamesa mo? sigurado ka ba?' tanong ng isang nakaka-tandang officer na nagpakilala bilang senior investigator manlapig. 'ah. ah... oo.' pautal-utal kong sagot sa kanya. 'naniniwala akong meron. nag-papanic na ako noon, kaya mahirap sabihin. tapos may baboy na stuffed toy, ' sabi ko, habang tila baga'y nawawalan ako ng abilidad na mag-isip ng tama. 'at naniniwala ka na ang taong humaharass sa'yo ay si michael villareal?' sabi ng isa pang officer, hindi ko maalala 'yung pangalan n'ya. wala s'yang badge. 'hindi ko alam buong pangalan n'ya, pero wala na akong ibang kilala na iba pang responsable.' 'at sa huling pagkakataon, just for the record, anong nangyari matapos mong mag-dial ng 911?' tanong ni manlapig sa ika-apat na pagkakataon sa gabing 'yun. 'may kung sino ang humawak sa binti ko. bukong-bukong, actually. nangyari 'yun bago pa ako magkaroon ng pagkakataong ipaliwanag ang sitwasyon sa operator. nagsusumigaw at piglas ang mga paa ko tapos tumakbo hanggang may makita akong tao sa labas na pina-tawag ako sa 911 para sa tulong.' sagot ko, habang pagod na pagod sa paulit-ulit at paikot-ikot na pagtatanong. 'si michael villareal ay natagpuang patay sa hindi kalayuan ng iyong lamesa nung pumunta ang officer namin sa pinang-yarihan ng insidente. nakita mo ba ang kanyang katawan nung tumakbo ka palabas ng office?' tanong ng isang officer. halos malaglag ang panga ko sa mga narinig ko at tumitig sa dalawang pulis habang balisa at nanginginig sa takot. 'hi.. hi.. hindi,' pabulong akong nag-salita, 'hindi ko maintindihan,' 'sinaksak s'ya hanggang sa mamatay gamit ang malaking kutsilyo. ang katawan n'ya ay balot ng dalawampu't-tatlong saksak,' paliwanag ni manlapig. 'at nakita namin ang kutsilyo ay nakabaon sa bibig nito, dahilan para dumikit ito sa sahig diretcho sa lalamunan,' 'may rason kami para pagsuspetyahan na ito rin ang sinasabi mong kutsilyo,' dagdag pa ng pangalawang officer. nakatitig ako sa dalawang pulis officer ng tahimik, hirap akong intindihin ang mga pangyayari lalo na't ang utak ko ay halos mawala na sa ulirat. 'ang mga sinabi mo ay nagpapatunay lamang sa mga natagpuaan namin sa cell phone ni michael villareal. nalaman namin na may roon siyang hacking apps,' pagpapatuloy ng senior officer. 'natagpuan din naman ang ilan mo pang mga hubong larawan at ang mga mensahe na iyong nabanggit. mayroon s'yang baril at nakita rin naman ang basyo ng bala nung binaril ka n'ya habang papatakas ka.' 'ang hindi namin maintindihan ay kung papaano s'ya namatay.' dagdag pa ng pangalawang officer, halatang hindi s'ya naniniwala sa aking reaksyon. 'ok lang kung napatay mo s'ya dahil sa self-defense, aya. may balak s'yang masama sa'yo.' 'hindi,' pautal-utal kong sagot. 'pangako, wala akong ideya... oh, oh my god.' naiyak na ako dahil sa mga nangyayari. 'ibig kong sabihin, nung nakaraang buwan lang may nag-report sa kanya galing sa isa n'yang co-worker,' sabi ni manlapig. 'jennah,' bulong ko. 'kilala mo si miss espiritu?' tanong ng pangalawang officer, at ng suspetya sa kanyang mga mats. 'hindi,' ako ang pumalit sa lamesa n'ya at nakuha ko ang notebook n'ya. dapat sinabi ko na 'to kanina pa. anong sabi sa report? doon nga ay nagtitigan ang dalawang pulis at maka-lipas ang ilang sandali ay inilatag at ipinaliwanag ni manlapig ang mga hindi magandang nangyari kay jennah na halos mangyari na sa akin. si jennah espiritu ay dumiretcho sa pinaka-malapit na hospital mula sa kanyang unang night shift tatlong buwan na ang nakakaraan. sobrang bugbog ng katawan n'ya at sugatan, at gustong mag-file ng anonymous rape kit. ang natanong damage n'ya sa kanyang puwerta ay sobrang severe na kinailangan n'yang sumailalim sa operasyon at magpatahi. nag-file s'ya ng police report makalipas ang dalawang buwan matapos s'yang hindi pumasa sa probationary period sa inyong kumpanya, ng nawala s'ya sa trabaho (ang nagiisang paraan para mabayaran ang kanyang utang sa hospital). ang nangyari ay ang kanyang aligasyon kontra kay michael villareal, na gumastos s'ya ng malaki sama mo pa ang hindi mabilang na kanyang mga co-workers na kumontra sa kanya laban sa magalang at kaaya-ayang katangian ni michael. 'pero kahapon lang ay iniurong na n'ya lahat ng mga isinampa n'yang kaso kay michael,' sabi ng walang badge na pulis. 'kasalukuyan naming inaalam ang kinaroroonan ni espiritu para ma-interview namin s'ya. sigurado ako na ngayon malinaw na kung bakit may suspetya kami sa iyo bilang nakikilala mo espiritu.' nagpatuloy ang mga tanong ng dalawang pulis hanggang may isang lalaki na nag-abot sa kanya ng isang sobre. natukoy na ng forensics ang fingerprint na nakita sa kutsilyo at ang blood-spatter patterns. kinailangan ko ring mag-submit ng dna samples para maka-tulong sa imbestigasyon at sa wakas ay pina-uwi na nila ako. sa bahay, dahil sa sobrang pagod, hindi ako maka-tulog. wala akong gamit na naiuwi. bag, cell phone at kahit ang jacket ko ay kinailangan i-submit bilang ebidensya. kaya naman napilitan akong gamitin ang luma kong laptop, umaasa na malibang sa internet. ang browser ko ay naka-login pa rin sa linkedin account ko mula sa nakaraang login, at nirefreshed ko ang page bilang naka-sanayan. isang maliit na red icon ang lumitaw na mayroon akong bagong mensahe. jennah. nagre-reply na s'ya sa akin. don't worry, sis. i took care of it. ❤️",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/t77k69/tagalized_story/,5 03 2022

"alex, tanghaling tapat ng sabado, 2021","(any review for this is very-very much appreciated. i'm an aspiring writer po and i just launched a passion project anthology, isa po ito sa mga kwento) &#x200b; **chairman** ngayon ko lang naranasan ‘to sa tagal ko nang nanunungkulan sa barangay. isama mo na sa mga karanasang ‘yon ang lahat ng away mag-asawa, suntukan ng mga lasing, at mga batang ginagahasa sa bukiran. pero eto… ngayon ko lang napansin na buong araw ko na palang hinihimas ang rosaryong nakasabit sa leeg ko. maya’t-maya ko pa hinahalikan at binubulungan na sana’y wag mangyari sa pamilya ko ang nakita ko kanina. naririnig ko pa rin ang sigaw ni cecil, kumare’t-kapitbahay namin, tanghaling tapat ng sabado, kung saan ang tanghalian sa buong kalsada nami’y naantala dahil sa kanyang nakakakilabot na sigaw. sa ilalim ng nagbabagang init ay nagsitakbuhan kami upang sumaklolo. kinailangan ko pang iwanan ang tinola ni misis at ang isang basong softdrinks na nilalanguyan pa dalawang yelo nang ako’y tumakbo papunta sa bahay ni cecil. ngayo’y hindi pa rin ako kumakain. sa totoo nga’y hindi pa ako nakakaranas ng gutom. hindi ko pa ata kaya. sa bahay ni cecil ay dinatnan namin ang katawan ng panganay ni cecil na si joe na nakaratay sa braso ng kanyang bunsong kapatid na si alex, sa sahig ng kanilang sala. sa leeg ni joe ay nakabaon ang basag na bote na ginamit ni alex na balot na balot sa dugo ng kanyang kapatid. agad ang kapit at halik ko sa aking rosaryo nang makita ko ang imahe; na parang sinaunang obra na naglalahad ng malagim na kwento. pero ano ang kwento neto? hanggang ngayon ay wala pa rin kaming ideya kung bakit. magmula sa pagsigaw ni cecil ng, “anong nangyari?! anak, anong nangyari?!” sa tulalang alex na nakatitig sa dilat na mga mata ni joe, hanggang sa pagpunta namin dito sa aking opisina sa barangay, ay wala pa rin kaming makuhang rason mula sa bakit. sa isang maliit na kwarto sa aking opisina’y pinaupo ko muna si alex. tulala at sinusubukang burahin ang dugo sa kanyang mukha gamit ang duguan ring damit n’ya. hinainan ko ng isang bote ng softdrinks at tatlong pandesal mula pa sa agahan namin kanina si alex, na agad namang n’yang kinain ng walang pag-aalinlangan. dito na nagsimulang gumapang ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod. isang kilabot na hindi ko maipaliwanag, habang pinapanood ko si alex na walang awat sa pagkain, habang ako’y hindi ko pa rin magawang matakam sa masarap na lutong nag-aabang sa’kin sa bahay. “alex,” marahan kong sinabi. “ba’t mo ginawa ‘yun?” tumingin lamang sa’kin si alex, patay na mga mata, bibig na mabagal ang nguya. at sa kanyang paglunok ay walang mga salitang bumalik sa’kin. hindi ko alam kung bakit pero bigla kong naalala si jefferson, isang tricycle driver dito sa’min. dalawang taon na ang nakakalipas nang mapatay n’ya ang isang dayo na nakaaway n’ya sa kalsada. nangyari ‘to nang kamuntikan n’yang makasalpukan ang sasakyan ng dayo, at nang nahinto silang dalawa’y nagkasagutan muna sila bago mapikon si jefferson. hinampas n’ya ng bakal na tubo ang dayo. hindi na raw n’ya napigilan dahil sa mga mapanglait na mga salitang tinawag sa kanya. bobo, unggoy, uling, mababa. labing-isang beses paulit-ulit na hinampas ni jefferson sa ulo ang dayo, at sa sobrang lakas ng bawat hampas ay may parte na ng utak na lumabas dito. sa prisinto’y naalala ko si jefferson, iyak nang iyak at humihingi ng tawad dahil sa nangyari. hindi makakain, hindi rin makatulog. nilamon na s’ya ng konsensya n’ya, at ang konsensya n’ya ang tumulak sa kanya na agawin ang baril ng isa sa mga pulis na nagbabantay, at iputok sa kanyang sariling ulo. nasaktan si jefferson, nagalit, at di nakapagpigil. naintindihan ko ang kwento ‘nun. pero bakit hindi ko maintindihan ‘to? alam kong magkasundo ang magkapatid na ‘to. alam ko kung ga’no sila kalapit sa isa’t-isa. kaya pa’no nangyari ‘to? ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod ay gumagapang paakyat hanggang sa aking dibdib, tila ba kumakapit ng mahigpit. pasikip nang pasikip at medyo nahihirapan akong huminga. ang kakaibang pakiramdam na ‘to’y tumitindi habang nanatiling tahimik at nakatitig lamang sa’kin si alex. biglang iniabot ni alex ang kanyang kamay at dito tumalon na ang puso ko. napaatras ako sa aking kinauupuan, at mabilisan kong hinugot ang aking rosaryo mula sa pagkakatago nito sa aking damit. itinutok ko ito kay alex, na walang ibang kibo kun’di ang kunin ang bote ng softdrinks na nasa harapan n’ya. mas bumilis pa ang pagkatok sa aking dibdib, na para bang kamuntikan na kong mamatay. habang si alex nama’y pinapanood lang ako habang patuloy ang kanyang pag-inom. wala nga ata talagang mangyayari, at nang maramdaman ko kung gaano katahimik ang kwarto’y kumalma na ako. bakit sa dulo ng utak ko’y hinihiling ko na may sapi o di kaya’y isang demonyo talaga ang kaharap ko, at sa presensya ng aking rosaryo’y masasaktan s’ya. kahit anong kakaiba. kahit ano basta magkaroon lang ng eksplenasyon ang nangyari. pero siguro’y kakaiba na rin ang ikinikilos ng bata. at siguro nga’y mas dapat talaga akong matakot sa buhay kaysa sa patay. **cecil** “saan ba ko nagkulang?” tanong ni aling cecil sa mga kumare n’yang nakapalibot sa kanya sa masikip na opisina ni chairmain. napapaligiran din s’ya ng makukulay na mga pamaypay na hindi sabay-sabay ang pagaspas sa harap n’ya; nilulunod si aling cecil sa hangin. ang kanyang mukha nama’y tila ba isang rebulto ng santo kung punas-punasan ng mga panyo. “hindi ko pa rin maintindihan,” dugtong n’ya. “hindi naman ako nagkulang sa aruga. pareho ko namang pinapakita sa kanila na pantay ang pagmamahal ko sa kanila.” tuyo na ang mga mata ni aling cecil, ngunit tila ba hindi pa rin tapos ang kanyang pag-iyak. “hindi sila nag-aaway. hindi ko man lang narinig na nagtalo silang dalawa. o kung may pagtatalo man, malamang sa malamang maliit na bagay lang ‘yun. hindi yung ikakamatay mo!” isang labi ng lumapit sa tenga ni aling cecil, “alam mo tingin ko, baka inggit ‘yan. kasi si joe lang may trabaho sa kanilang dalawa, di ba? tapos si alex, wala pa rin sa kolehiyo. nag-aaral pa rin. sigurado akong ‘yun ang dahilan.” isa pang labi ang lumapit sa kabilang tenga naman ni aling cecil, “baka napikon na. kasi di ba halos s’ya na sa lahat ng gawaing bahay? baka pakiramdam n’ya porke’t mas malaki ambag ng kapatid n’ya , alila na s’ya neto.” isang labi naman na kaharap ni aling cecil ang nagsabing, “baka nagbabait-baitan lang kasi nga si joe ang halos sumasalo sa mga bayarin, pati sa pag-aaral n’ya. pero galit talaga s’ya, kasi baka naman may pagkakataong mas nabibigyang-atensyon si joe kahit hindi n’yo napapansin. kasi halimbawa uuwi s’yang pagod galing sa trabaho, syempre di n’yo maiwasang alagaan, pagsilbihan.” sa gitna ng mga labing ito’y si aling cecil, at ang ideyang unti-unting nabubuo dahil sa mga sinasabi ng mga labi sa kanya. “siguro,” sabi n’ya. “siguro nga.” **abbie** ang pangalan n’ya’y abbie. social worker daw s’ya. pagpasok n’ya’y agad bumungad sa’kin ang asul na bra sa ilalim ng dilaw na blouse nang tapatan ito ng liwanag mula sa bintanang katabi ko. sa kanyang pagtali ng buhok ay nakita kong basang-basa na ang kanyang kili-kili at kumikinang na sa pawis ang kanyang leeg. “alex?” sabi n’ya habang maya’t-mayang tinutulak ng kanyang daliri ang salamin n’yang dumudulas sa kanyang matangos na ilong. “bakit di mo ikwento muna sa’kin ang nangyari bago tayo umalis dito?” pasensya ka na, abbie. hindi ko nagawang sabihin kay chairman, na kilala pa mandin namin. hinding-hindi ko rin masasabi sa’yo. walang ibang maglalahad ng nangyari kun’di ang mga taong nais magbigay kahulugan dito, kasi kung ako tatanungin kung bakit, sa totoo lang, hindi ko rin alam ang isasagot. may nabasag akong bote sa kusina kanina, at sa pagpulot ko nito’y pumasok sa isip ko ang isang udyok. yung tipo ng udyok kapag nasa mataas kang lugar, at bigla mo na lang gustong itulak ang kasama mo. pero alam mong hindi ito dapat gawin, at kakapit ka pa nang mas mahigpit sa kanila para masiguro mong hindi ito mangyayari. ang udyok na ito’y nagsabi sa’kin na isaksak ko kay kuya ang basag na bote. at nalaman ko na lang na totoo na pala ang lahat nang dumapo sa aking balat ang mainit na dugo ni kuya. nahinto lang ako nang maramdaman ko ang buto sa leeg n’ya at nang marinig kong nabibilaukan na s’ya sa kanyang sariling dugo. hindi ko pa rin alam kung bakit. sana, tulad ng iniisip ni chairman, ay nasapian na nga lang ako. pero nakita ko ang lahat, andun ako. hindi ko lang alam na totoo pala ang lahat. namatay si kuya joe sa wala. at hindi ko matanggap na wala. normal lang sana ang sabado namin. tahimik. nanonood lang si kuya ng tv, naglilinis ako sa kusina. si nanay nama’y namamalengke ng pananghalian namin. bicol express daw ang lulutuin n’ya. puta, sinira ko ang araw. gusto kong umiyak dahil hindi na kami babalik sa salo-salo namin. “alex?” muling tawag ni abbie. “gusto kong malaman kung bakit. tayong dalawa lang. kaibigan mo ko dito. hinding-hindi ko ‘to sasabihin sa nanay mo, sa mga kapitbahay n’yo. may mga naririnig ako sa labas na dahil daw sa inggit? totoo ba ‘to? sa inggit nga? magmula nang dinala ako ni chairman dito sa maliit na kwartong ito’y napagpasyahan kong manahimik na lang sa nangyari. sa ngayo’y nilalabanan ko ang mga luha, nilalabanan ko ang panginginig ng aking bibig, at ang mga salitang gustong lumabas mula sa’kin. dapat mukhang hindi ko pinagsisisihan. dapat mukha akong galit. para naman mabigyang halaga, mabigyan ng ibig-sabihin ang pagkamatay ni kuya joe. dapat tinatatak ko sa utak ko na dapat lang! dapat lang sa kanya ang nangyari. dapat hindi ako bibigay. dahil kapag natalo ako, mamatay talaga sa wala si kuya. “sige, kung ayaw mong magkwento, ako muna. kasi naalala ko ‘tong isang batang babae at ang tatay n’yang abusado. tatay n’yang lasinggero. tatay n’yang isang beses s’yang hinipuan sa kanyang sariling kwarto at pinilit. ampon ang batang ‘yon, at tatay-tatayan n’ya lang etong umaabuso sa kanya. takot na takot ang bata dahil pakiramdam n’ya isang gabi’y papatayin na lang s’ya bigla neto. kaya naman isang gabi, nang bigla s’yang pinuntahan ng kanyang tatay upang pagsamantalahan ulit, sinasaksak ito ng bata gamit ang lapis sa mata, sa leeg, at sa dibdib.” kumuha ng panyo si abbie. sa kanyang paggalaw ay muling sumisilip ang kanyang bra sa likod ng blouse na parang mga batang naglalaro sa likod ng kurtina. “masarap sa pakiramdam, pero pumapatay pa rin s’ya ng tao. ilan taon n’yang dinibdib ‘yun. hanggang ngayon nararamdaman pa rin n’ya ang mga kamay ng tatay n’ya sa kanyang ari. sa kanyang dibdib. ilang taon bago n’ya matanggap ang ginawa n’ya. ngayon, medyo mahirap pa ring ikwento, pero kahit papaano’y kaya ko na. nangyari na kasi.” para bang may sumuntok sa aking dibdib nang marinig ko ‘to. bigla kong tinanggal ang aking paningin sa kanyang bra, at sa paggalaw ng aking mga mata’y bigla kong naramdaman ang pamumuo ng mga luha. “ayos lang, alex. pero andito lang ako. aalagaan ka muna namin. tapos pag handa ka na, makikinig ako. kahit pakonte-konte pa, ayos lang. aantayin kong mabuo ang kwento mo.” bumibilis bigla ang tibok ng puso ko. lalong nanginginig ang aking labi. at biglang pumasok si kuya sa isip ko, tumatakbo papalayo sa akin. mga bata pa kami, at hinahabol ko s’ya. “alex?” kuya wag kang lumayo! “alex?” kuya dito ka lang! kailangan kita dito! “sige, ayusin na natin pag-alis mo.” at parang isang batang nadapa sa semento, dito na walang awat na tumulo ang luha sa aking mga mata. “alex?” “hindi ko rin alam… hindi… ko rin alam. sorry, kuya! sorry! hindi ko rin alam kung bakit! patayin n’yo na lang ako! hindi ko alam anong nangyari! hindi ko na kaya!” lumalabo na ang aking paningin, pero kahit ga’no kalabo ang aking mga mata’y kitang-kita ko ang gulat at takot sa mukha ni abbie. pasensya ka na, kuya.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/nlygsa/alex_tanghaling_tapat_ng_sabado_2021/,27 05 2021
Tagalized - Morgue.,"may nakita akong isang ad sa dyaryo, hindi man ako maka-paniwala at kinilabutan pero nakaka-anyaya ang sinasabi. ""gusto mo bang kumita ng 1000 pesos per night bilang security sa morge? apply na!"" medyo matagal na rin akong walang trabaho at makaka-bayad na rin ako ng upa at makapa-mamumuhay ng maginhawa kung magkataon. kaya naman nag-apply ako kahit medyo nag-dalawang-isip, inaasahan ko nang hindi ako makaka-kuha ng kahit anong sagot mula sa kumpanya. pero wala pang dalawang oras ay may natanggap akong email mula sa employer: ""maraming salamat sa ipinasa mong application form para sa posisyong night guard sa morge. masaya kong ibinabalita na ang mga skills na iyong binanggit ay tugma para sa hinahanap namin sa isang guard at gusto kitang offeran ng isang taong kontrata. kung ika'y sumasang-ayon sa mga kasunduan sa ibaba, maari lamang mag-iwan ka ng signature online via e-signature na naka-lista sa baba at pumunta ka sa (redacted) eksakto alas diyes ngayong gabi. makaka-tanggap ka ng 5000 linggo-linggo na direkta sa iyong bangko."" ngayong gabi? hindi ba masaydong mabilis ang mga pangyayari? pero hindi na ako nag-reklamo o tanong pa. hindi ko alam kung anong aasahan o kung sino ang madadatnan ko doon, kaya sinuot ko na 'yung damit at pantalon ko at agad nagtungo sa nasabing address nang mas maaga sa itinakdang oras. nandoon na ako ng mga alas nwebe kwarenta 'y singko ng gabi at may isang middle aged na lalaki na mukhang nag-tatrabaho sa morge ang bumati sa akin.

""ahh, 'yun. wala naman gaano, siguraduhin mo lang na walang makakapasok."" - lumapit s'ya sa akin at sinabing - ""o labas."" isang maikling katahimikan at nagtinginan kaming dalawa, doon ay napa-ngiti ito at ang sabi: ""de, joke lang. so ayun, tapos na 'yung shift ko, kaya naman mauuna na ako. basta doon ka lang sa office at mag-relax hanggang alas sais ng umaga. doon darating na 'yung kahalili mo."" at doon nga ay umalis na s'ya. umupo ako sa upuan sa may office. akala ko siguro naman walang hindi magandang mangyayari. may papel sa harap ko at habang tinitignan ko ito ay doon ko lang napagtanto na ito ay listahan ng mga rules na specifically naka-asign sa akin. ito ang sabi: sa bagong gwardiya. welcome to the company. sa baba ay ang listahan ng mga rules para sa iyong trabaho: 1. ang una mong dapat gawin ay ang mag-conduct ng full sweep sa buong area para siguraduhin na walang kakaibang mga nangyayari liban sa ordinary (pati sa crypt). important note: kung may katawan man na naka-labas sa chambers sa loob ng crypt, itulak mo lamang ito pabalik. dapat manatili silang nasa-loob sa lahat ng pagkakataon. 2. matapos ang buong sweep, maari ka nang manatili sa loob ng office hanggang matapos ang shift mo. may iba pang mga rules na naka-lista sa baba, pero nag-desisyon akong libutin muna ang buong lugar. medyo may kaliitan ang morge, may isang malaking medical room na halos mapuno ng medical supplies ang loob. pero may sapat na espasyo para sa 2-3 lamesa na puwedeng pag-lagyan ng mga labi. sa loob ng crypt ay may palikuran. nag-desisyon akong unahin na ang pinaka-ayaw kong lugar - 'yung crypt. umalis na ako sa office at binuksan ang solid at napaka-bigat na pinto ng crypt, agad-agad ay sinalubong ako ng napaka-lamig na hangin. sa loob, may dalawang katawan sa gitna ng kwarto at mga chambers sa pader. lahat naman sila ay sarado kaya naman mabilis akong lumabas ng kwarto. habang pabalik ako mula sa bathroom, may nakita akong lalaki na naka lab coat na naka-tayo sa gitna ng medical room. parang may kinakalikot gamit ang mga medical tools malapit sa isang body bag. ""tang... tinakot mo naman ako boss."" - sabi ko. tinignan n'ya ako na parang wala lang at bumalik sa ginagawa nito. ""akala ko umuwi na ang lahat. ako nga pala si michael, bagong gwardiya."" - sabi ko, gaya ng nauna, hindi n'ya ako pinansin. kumaway na ako at umalis pabalik ng office. babasahin ko na sana ulit ang mga rules ng biglang may matinis na tunog akong narinig na para bang may bakal na kumi-kiskis sa isa pang bakal na nag-eecho sa buong building. medyo mahina na ito at parang nang-gagaling sa mga tubo. tumagal din iyon ng ilang segundo at huminto sa kaparehas na segundo. hindi ko na lang pinansin at i-idlip na lang, check ng cell phone. pero medyo tumatagal na ang tunog at habang mas kinikilabutan ako ay unti-unti nang nagbabago ang kanina'y parang bakal na kumi-kiskis sa isa't-isa ay naging... ungol. lumabas ako ng office at tatanungin ko sana 'yung kaninang naka lab coat pero mukhang naka-uwi na s'ya sa mga oras na 'yun. hindi ako sigurado kung saan mismo nang-gagaling ang tunog, pero parang sa may crypt, kaya naman pinuntahan ko ito. 'yung oras na binuksan ko ang pinto ay ang buong building ay nanahimik. huminga ako ng malalim at napansin ko na 'yung isang chambers ay naka-bukas na ng bahagya. tinulak ko ito pabalik at agad-agad na bumalik sa office. nawala na ng tuluyan ang matinis na na para bang ungol na iyon. nagpatuloy ako sa pagbabasa: 3. maari kang matulog sa office, pero dapat handa ka sa mga mangyayari. sleep at your own risk, ika nga nila. matapos nun ay isang napaka-lakas na tunog ang halos mag-patalon sa buong pagkatao ko. ""tulong! palabasin n'yo ako dito!"" - ang boses ay tila nang-gagaling sa mga tubo. tumayo ako habang sobra ang kalabog ng dibdib ko. ""palabasin n'yo ako, hindi ako maka-hinga!"" - paulit-ulit na pagmama-kaawa ng boses na ngayon ay may kasama ng kalabog. binuksan ko ang pintuan ng office at sa hindi malaman na dahilan sa crypt nang-gagaling ang boses. nanginginig, pero binuksan ko ang pinto. ""buhay pa ako, isa itong pagkakamali! tulong!"" - mas lalong lumakas ang boses nung oras na buksan ko ang napaka-bigat at solidong pinto. ""asan ka?!"" - nanginginig akong tumingin sa paligid, habang ang walang humpay na tumatawag ang boses na may kasamang malalakas na kalabog. lumapit ako at unti-unting inilapit ang tenga para maka-siguro na ang bubuksan ko ay ang tamang chamber. ""buhay pa ako! utang na loob! ple----"" ang boses at ang mga kalabog ay daglian na lamang nawala nang biglaan kong binuksan ang isa sa mga chambers at sinalubong ako ng malamig na bangkay ng isang middle-aged na lalaki. tumayo lang ako doon, nakatitig sa bangkay, halos tumigil sa pagtakbo ang isip ko sa kung ano ang mga nangyayari. malinaw na malinaw kong narinig at naramdaman ko ang bawat kalabog nung oras na hinawakan ko ang hawakan ng chamber at para bang may kung sino man na bigla-bigla na lang nagpatigil nito. pinaglalaruan lang ba ako ng aking isipan? tinulak ko ang chamber pabalik at mabilis na umalis doon, nilock ang pinto ng office. iniisip ko na ang pag-aaply sa trabahong 'to ay maaring isang malaking pagkakamali. pakiramdam ko na nababaliw na ako, pero agad ko ring kinumbinse ang sarili ko na nasa ulo ko lang lahat ng 'to. nagpatuloy ako sa pagbabasa ng mg rules: 4. puwede kang mag-patugtog para maibsan ang katahimikan basta't hindi ito makaka-kuha ng atensyon sa labas. 5. kung may marinig kang hindi mo maipaliwanag na ingay galing sa may crypt, 'wag mo na lamang ito pansinin. 6. kung ang mga ingay na 'yun ay naging sigaw ng pagpapanic, gawin ang mga sumusunod: • kung ang mga sigaw ay mula sa babae, 'wag mo pansinin hanggang sa tumigil ito. 'wag na 'wag kang papasok sa loob ng crypt sa mga oras na nangyayari ito sa kahit anong dahilan. • kung ang mga ingay ay mula sa lalaki, hanapin ang pinag-mumulan ng ingay at hatakin ang chamber. dapat huminto na ang ingay pagkatapos mong mabuksan ang chamber. doon na nagtatapos ang page. nilapag ko na ang papel at dahan-dahang inilapat ang likod ko sa upuan. ala una na noon at nag-sisimula na akong antukin. maya-maya pa ay nagsisimula ng pumikit ang aking mga mata ng kusa. nagsisimula na akong mahulog sa panaginip nang biglang may mahigpit akong hawak na naramdaman sa likod ng aking balikat. sa sobrang gulat ko ay agad-agad akong napatayo at sinipa ang upuan. walang tao o kahit ano noong mga oras na iyon. hindi na ako inaantok nung mga oras na 'yun. tahimik na ang buong kapaligiran noon at nagpunta ako sa palikuran. pagbalik ko ay alas tres na at halos handa na akong tapusin ang shift ko dito. napagisip-isip ko na hindi na rin masama para sa isang libo, hanggang tinalikod ko ang papel na may mga rules at napansin kong may naka-sulat pa sa likod: 7. lahat ng staff ay lalabas o dapat nasa labas na ng building bago mag alas diyes ng gabi, kaya kung may makita kang lalaki na naka lab coat during your shift, 'wag na 'wag sa kahit ano mang sitwasyon na subukan mong makipag-usap sa kanya. paulit-ulit-ulit kong binasa ang rule ng limang beses, pero wala pa ring nagbabago sa naka-sulat. may mahinang katok sa pinto ng office. tinignan ko ito at sa likod ng salamin ay nakita ko ang lalaking naka lab coat naka-ngiti sa akin. alas kwatro 'y media na at patuloy pa rin s'ya sa pagkatok. sa mga magta-tanong, hindi ko na ho alam kung saan ko ito nakuha dahil 2018 ko pa po ito tinagalog. nakita ko lang na naka-save pa rin sa note ng selpon ko. salamat and ang init. tangina.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/t8j464/tagalized_morgue/,7 03 2022
Naturopathic Medicine in Philippines,"so. we have this client na “doctor” ng naturopathic medicine. she’s old na like mga nasa early 70’s. wayback pre pandemic (february 2020) sinabi niya na etong corona virus is a “scare tactics” daw para kumita yung malalaking medical company. she also added “sa china kasi madaming mahihirap kaya madaming malnourished thence spreading the virus” so naisip ko rin na baka nga vitamins lang katapat. the pandemic and lockdown happened. may meeting kami sa kanya and she gives us this silver colloidal naka boteng maliliit and isang 6 gallon na lalagyan. i dont think na fda approved and registered yon. i also researched na may adverse side effects yon. pinapainom niya sa amin yon and she claimed na wala daw side effects. but we insist. yung 6 gallon na lalagyan, ayun wala pa sa kalahati apat na buwan na. hahahh napaisip talaga ako kung doctor ba talaga siya nung sinabi niya during meeting na “wag kayo magsusuot ng face mask kasi masama yon. naiinhale lang din yung carbon dioxide sa katawan” yup as same as dj loonyo’s comment. how come na “doctor” sya tapos magcocomment sya ng ganon? the news broke out about sa use ng hydrochloroquine on treating covid. and guess what? meron syang bote na maliit (kasing laki ng lalgyanan ng essential oil pang air diffuser) non. i don’t know kung saan niya pinag kukuha yon haha. also di rin nakawala yung ivermectin. i’ve seen her sharing post sa fb good things about it. pinagtatanggol niya talaga ang ivermectin. binigyan nya yung mga ksamahan ko isang banig. ang nakakabahala pa don, sa banig ng gamot na yon, walang ni isang letter na nakasulat. yup as in yung aluminum lang ang makikita mo sa likod. wala rin labels sa mismong tablet. vaccine? of course. wala. hahaha. pero sinabi niya. in a drop-dead-serious face “oy kayo, wag kayong magpapabakuna ah” like sabi ko sa isip ko p*tangina doctor ka ba talaga? i get it naman na she’s into natural medicine. but there are some things na separate sa natural med from modern medicine. i just found out na walang “md” sa titles niya. ibig sabihin it is illegal na mag practice sya ng medicine. (please correct me on this if i’m wrong) p.s. she’s connected sa company na nagbebenta ng products like silver colloidal na nagsisimula sa letter z.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/n0h6jv/naturopathic_medicine_in_philippines/,28 04 2021

""be aware huwag kayong maniwala dyan sa vaccine nayan. automatic na magpa- positive ka sa covid pag tinest kahit walang sakit. yan raw ang pinasa sa congress dito. malapit na nila ilabas ang vaccine ngayon na may microchip. huwag kayong magpapa- vaccine pag lumabas nayan dyan sa pinas, kasi ibang klaseng needles ang ginagamit tulad sa europe na my microchip. ipakalat at ipaalam nyo sa lahat ng mga kaanak nyo... hindi yan biro, itong virus ang way nila para ma implement ang microchip... yan ang makikita pag mag oopen ng website, ng us. nakakatakot yan pag napasa na. ... pwede na silang basta pumasok sa loob ng bahay mo, pag nag mandatory nayan... tiyak, magkakaroon ng war dito sa us. dahil maraming against sa mandatory. sa canada, sapilitang pumupunta sa bahay para pilitin ang mga tao na ma test ng covid. pag mangyari yan, lahat na bansa susunod na. may nag test na niyan dito gamit ang papaya fruit at nagka positive ang papaya sa covid. ito ang sinasabi na bawasan ang bilyon bilyong tao sa mundo. mga kampon sila ng diablo, lahat ng testing kits galing sa us, kaya ang mga tao di na naniwala sa numbers of covid. yung dr. fuchi na nagsabi na my vaccine na para sa covid, kasabwat siya ni bill gates. si bill gates ang punot dulo ng lahat ng virus nayan. pastor kasi siya sa illuminati, isang devil church. siya ang gumawa ng covid virus at dinala sa china at pag kumalat na sa buong mundo, siya na din ang maglalabas ng vaccine, panlaban sa virus. plano na nila yan lahat dahil ito ang nakasulat sa revelation. mostly, lahat na nga ng tao dito, may baril kaya pag mag mamandatory nayan dito sa us, war talaga ang mangyaryari. yung mga doctors mismo ang nagsabi na di maganda ang vaccine sa katawan dahil puro chemicals ang ingredients at my biochip. may mga videos na dinidelete na sa youtube, para hindi na mapanood ng mga tao. basahin nyo agad ito, bago nila burahin... dahil lahat ng information about sa gamot ng china virus, o sa plano ng ""who"" at ""doh"" ,at ng mga gobyerno... pinabubura agad nla."" pls forward...",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/nmlku1/sample_ng_fake_news_na_nakalat_sa_fb_messenger/,28 05 2021

madalas ko ngang kinukurot at sinasampal ang mukha ko para masiguradong hindi ako nananaginip. &#x200b; apat na taon na kami ng aking mahal na nobya. noong niligawan ko siya, lahat ng mga kaibigan at kapitbahay ko sinabihan ako na huwag ko na raw ituloy dahil bad news daw siya at mapapariwara lamang ako kapag naging kami. na may ""something"" daw ang pamilya nila sa probinsya. bagong lipat lang ako sa lugar na iyon at mag-a-anim na buwan pa lamang doon nang makilala ko ang nobya ko. hindi ako nakinig sa mga sinasabi nila, mga tsismoso at mga tsimosa, at itinuloy ang panliligaw. hindi nagtagal, sinagot din niya ako at talagang sobrang ligaya ko simula noon. lahat ng mga nagsabing mapapariwara raw ako, hindi ko na sila mga kaibigan ngayon. &#x200b; last year lang, nagsimula na kaming mag-live in. kumuha kami ng condo sa taguig at talagang sobrang saya namin. halos wala kaming problema, wala kaming anumang away. at siyempre, dahil iyon sa sinusunod ko ang mga special rules. &#x200b; well, wala naman talaga siyang special rules para sa akin. kung ano ang gusto at ayaw ng mga pangkaraniwang babae sa kanilang nobyo, ganoon din naman siya. sa totoo lang, mas maluwag pa siya sa ibang mga naging girlfriend ko dati. understanding siya, hindi demanding. kaya mahal na mahal ko siya! &#x200b; ang tinutukoy kong mga ""rules"" ay mga simpleng observations ko lamang sa kanya. mga bagay na hindi naman niya ipinagbabawal o dine-demand pero mas maganda kung alam mo. ito ang susi ng aming napakasaya at very smooth na relationship. hindi ba't may kasabihan tayo na, ""ang nagsasama nang matapat at sumusunod sa mga rules ng girlfriend niya, nagsasama nang maluwat."" &#x200b; heto ang mga simpleng rules kaya't perfect ang relationship namin ng aking perfect girlfriend. konti lang naman sila: &#x200b; rule #1. ayaw na ayaw ng girlfriend ko ang mga simbahan. hindi kasi siya religious at ang sabi niya, na-trauma raw siya dahil pinalaki siya ng kanyang lola na super relihiyosa. isa yatang panatiko ang lola niya na miyembro ng isang religious group sa probinsya nila na masasabing parang kulto na nga. kaya't kapag nakakakita siya ng mga churches (kahit anong religion), parang sumasama ang pakiramdam niya. isang beses nga, dumaan ako sa isang kalsada na hindi pamilyar sa akin. ang sabi kasi ng ka-opisina ko, shortcut daw iyon. kaya hindi ko alam na mayroon palang simbahang dadaanan. pagdaan na pagdaan ng kotse ko sa tapat ng simbahan, biglang nagtitili ang girlfriend ko. nagpupumiglas siya, parang nasasaktan ang buong katawan. grabeng trauma siguro ang sinapit niya sa kamay ng lola niya kaya ganoon ang reaksyon niya. kaya binilisan ko ang pagpapatakbo ng kotse ko hanggang sa makalayo kami roon. saka lamang siya huminahon. umiiyak siya, humihingi ng sorry. naiintindihan ko naman siya, wala siyang kasalanan. biktima lamang siya. hinaplos ko ang kanyang buhok at pinunasan ang kanyang mga luha. doon ko lang napansin na namumula ang kanyang noo at mga pisngi. pati mga braso niya ay namumula rin. nang pansinin ko ito, ang sabi niya ay baka nauntog siya o naihampas ang mga braso sa dashboard o sa bintana noong nagpupumiglas siya. niyaya ko siyang dalhin sa ospital pero tumanggi siya. sasabihin ko sanang imposibleng nauntog siya dahil hindi naman mukhang mga pasa ang nasa kanyang mukha at mga braso kundi mukha itong parang nasunog ngunit bigla siyang ngumiti, ang kanyang perpektong mga ngiti, kaya't nakumbisi na rin ako na okay na siya. pagkauwi namin, wala nang anumang bakas sa kanyang mukha na nauntog siya. &#x200b; kaya't kapag bumabiyahe kami, kailangang planuhin ang rutang dadaanan namin at siguraduhing hindi kami malalapit sa anumang simbahan. &#x200b; rule #2. hindi kumakain ng gulay ang girlfriend ko. siguro naman, marami sa inyo ganito ang mga girlfriend. mahilig sa meat pero ayaw kumain ng gulay. nakakatuwa, hindi ba? ako rin naman hindi masyadong mahilig sa gulay. kaya't kung kakain kami o lalabas, laging meat ang kinakain namin. hilig nga niya 'yung mga unli na barbecue. lalo na 'yung mayroong mga lamanloob. paboritong-paborito niya ang atay, intestines, puso, utak, at kung anu-ano pa. mahilig din siya sa dinuguan. minsan nga, isinama niya ako sa isang exclusive restaurant. mga members lang daw ang pwedeng kumain doon at miyembro siya at ang kanyang mga parents. nasa isang subdivision ito na puro mayayaman lamang ang nakatira. sa labas, mukha lang itong malaking mansyon pero pagpasok mo, isa pala itong restaurant. grabe, mayayaman talaga ang mga kumakain doon. may nakita pa nga akong mga artista at mga pulitiko. &#x200b; ang specialty ng restaurant na iyon ay mga lamanloob. tuwang-tuwa ang girlfriend ko nang orderin niya ang soup number 5. pinakain niya sa akin iyon at pinaubos dahil aphrodisiac daw iyon. masaya ko namang sinunod ito kahit na first time ko kumain noon. excited din ako dahil siguradong mapapalaban ako sa mangyayaring bakbakan pagkauwi namin. medyo natigilan lang ako noong una kong makita. ang alam ko kasi, ang main ingredient ng soup number 5 ay ari at bayag ng isang kalabaw. pero, noong pagsandok ko, parang iba ang nakita ko. parang iba ang hugis, parang malapit sa tao. pero siyempre, hindi ko na 'yun pinansin at siguradong imahinasyon ko lamang iyon. &#x200b; rule #3. hindi mahilig magpa-picture at mag-selfie ang aking girlfriend. ayaw na ayaw niya na kuhanan siya ng litrato, lalo na kung stolen. kaya nga kapag lumalabas kami, lagi siyang naka-cap at naka-long sleeves na jacket na may hoodie (ayaw niya rin kasi ang naaarawan). noong bago pa lamang kami, sinubukan ko siyang kuhanan ng picture nang palihim. pagtingin ko, nagtaka ako dahil parang deformed ang hitsura niya sa larawan. ni-restart ko ang phone ko at inulit pero ganoon pa rin. kaya tumabi ako sa kanya at mabilis na kumuha ng selfie. grabe ang galit niya sa akin! pinagsusuntok niya ako pero tinanggap ko ang lahat hanggang sa mawala ang galit niya. mga six months din bago ko nakita 'yung picture sa phone ko. inabot din kasi ng six months bago natanggal ang cast sa mga braso at binti ko. &#x200b; pagtingin ko sa picture na kinuha ko (kinuha ng girlfriend ko 'yung cellphone ko at itinago pero nakita ko rin naman sa closet niya noong makalabas ako sa ospital), naguluhan ako sa nakita ko. sa larawan, nakatingin ako sa camera at nakangiti. sa tabi ko, may isang matandang babae ang nakaupo. kulubot na ang kanyang mga mukha at kulay abo na ang mga buhok. suot-suot niya ang favorite t-shirt ng nobya ko. &#x200b; napailing na lang ako sa nakita ko. bilib na bilib pa naman ako sa camera ng iphone pero mukhang nagma-malfunction din pala ito. kaya ngayon, samsung na ang telepono ko. hindi ko na rin kinuhanan pa ng litrato ang girlfriend ko. &#x200b; rule #4. huwag magpapakita ng kabaitan sa ibang mga babae. ops! baka isipin niyo na selosa at mahigpit ang girlfriend ko. naku, diyan po kayo nagkakamali. sa katunayan, ayos lang sa kanya na makipagkaibigan ako sa mga babae. hindi siya nagagalit o nagtatampo. naalala ko nga noon, mayroon akong naging kaibigang babae sa trabaho, si carla. siyempre, tayong mga lalaki, natural na friendly tayo sa mga kababaihan. accomodating tayo at mahilig magbiro at mag-joke. madalas tuloy ay pinaghihinalaan tayo ng ating mga girlfriends. pero, iba ang girlfriend ko. ayos lang sa kanya ang ganoon. kahit nakikita niyang magkasama kami ni carla at nagtatawanan kapag bumibisita siya sa office, hindi siya nagagalit. nakakalungkot nga lang na hindi na natin kapiling si carla ngayon. natagpuan na lang siya isang umaga sa kuwarto niya, patay na. noong bumisita ako sa burol niya, nasabi sa akin ng kapatid niya na na-overdose daw sa gamot si carla. pagpasok daw nila sa kuwarto niya, nakita nila si carla na nakahiga sa kama, bumubula ang bibig. sa tabi niya, maraming nagkalat na gamot. puro tusok din ng karayom ang buong katawan niya. marahil daw, dahil sa depresyon o anumang mental illness, tinusok-tusok ni carla ang sarili niya ng karayom at pagkatapos ay uminom ng maraming gamot. ang nakapagtataka lamang daw, wala silang nakitang anumang karayom sa kuwarto ni carla. &#x200b; gaya nga ng sabi ko, hindi selosa ang girlfriend ko. marami akong mga naging kaibigang babae. nandyan si cherry na dating classmate ko noong college. marahil ay nakita mo siya sa balita. isang gabi kasi, habang papauwi galing trabaho, may tumulak daw sa kanya kaya nasagasaan siya ng isang bus. naging close ko rin si june at si barbie. kaso lang, maaga silang kinuha ni lord. bigla na lang silang na-comatose at hindi na nagising. over-fatigued daw sabi ng mga doktor. &#x200b; inaasar nga ako ng mga kaibigan ko ngayon na under daw ako ng girlfriend ko kaya hindi ako nakikipagkaibigan sa mga babae. pero ayos lang naman sa akin. mas masaya akong tawaging under kaysa naman magkaroon ng mga babaeng kaibigan pagkatapos... &#x200b; rule #5. kapag nagising ka sa madaling araw at nakita si girlfriend na naghahanap ng pagkain at mukhang gutom na gutom, magtago sa closet o kaya'y tumalon sa bintana. nakakatawa itong experience na ito. bakit ba ang mga babae, laging gutom? tapos, kapag pinakain mo masaya na kaagad sila? &#x200b; nagising ako isang beses mga alas-tres 'yata iyon. may narinig kasi akong mga kalampag kaya bumangon ako. wala rin kasi si girlfriend sa tabi ko. sa kusina ko siya nakita, hinahalughog ang ref namin. kaso, hindi pa kami nakakapag-grocery dahil wala pang sahod. &#x200b; tiningnan niya ako, nakakunot ang noo niya. ""gutom na ako,"" sabi niya. kahit gutom, sobrang ganda pa rin niya. kaya hindi ko napansin na tumutulo na pala ang laway niya. &#x200b; siyempre, ayokong nagugutom ang girlfriend ko kaya agad akong tumawag para magpa-deliver. pero, hindi na nakapagpigil pa ang girlfriend ko. sobrang gutom na siya, eh. kaya, ayun! &#x200b; pagkatapos niyang kumain, sobrang saya na niya. &#x200b; anyways, naging maayos naman ang lahat. ngayon, alam ko na ang gagawin kapag nakita siyang ganoon kaya wala naman na kaming naging problema pa. at saka, pwede namang mabuhay na isa lang ang kidney mo, hindi ba? basta't sisiguraduhin ko lang na hindi na ito mauulit pa. nag-iisa na lang ang natitira, eh. &#x200b; oh, napakadali lamang namang tandaan, 'di ba? 'yung ibang girlfriend diyan, napaka-demanding, ang dami-daming gusto, ang dami-daming ayaw. pero girlfriend ko, simple lang. simple pero perfect. kaya napakasaya ko sa kanya, eh. hindi ko na siya papakawalan. at siguradong-sigurado ako na hinding-hindi na niya ako papakawalan. &#x200b; edit: sa mga nagco-comment po at concerned sa akin, huwag po kayong mag-alala. ayos lang po ako. masaya, rewarding, at healthy ang relationship naming dalawa. oo, aaminin ko na medyo underweight ako ngayon nang kaunti (malnourished daw sabi ng doktor pero ano ba namang alam ng doktor? gusto lang akong pagka-perahan 'nun, eh!). medyo napapadalas din akong atakihin ng anemia (although hindi naman ako anemic dati, weird). pero, overall, perfect and happy kaming dalawa. &#x200b; tunay na love ko ang girlfriend ko!!! &#x200b; please subscribe to my pinoy horror animation channel!!! yt: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnaflx-rcdu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnaflx-rcdu)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/oiwuig/perpekto_ang_girlfriend_ko_basta_susundin_mo_lang/,12 07 2021

Beware of PNEUMONIA,"as a father of 3...akala ko expert na ko sa lahat ng sakit ng bata. hindi namin dinadala sa hospital kasi mababa lang naman lagnat at pawala wala pa. hindi sya nag tatae so hindi din dehydrated. we ruled out dengue and amoeba as well. little did we know, our little one is having rsv na pala. common ubo't sipon (na usong uso ngayon) pero sa lungs ang atake and pneumonia agad. he's only 3yrs old, pandemic baby so hindi sanay sa tao.. imagine leaving him alone sa icu surrounded by nurses and doctors he doesn't know.. it's heartbreaking. symtoms ang things to look out/do for so you can avoid our mistakes: - nose flaring - tignan ang tyan kung may struggle sa pag hinga - if you have o2 finger reader mas okay - a simple online consultation with your doctor sana would suffice, antibiotics lang sana sapat na - we are self employed so walang hmo, get some one time er use card or something.. or apply for your own hmo kahit sa mga bata lang - mag pa flu shot na buong pamilya pag flu season just today, i found out about a colleague who passed away due to rsv pneumonia as well 😢 he was younger than me.",https://i.redd.it/iz1b02gq3m4c1.jpg,6 12 2023
My proposal is penalized individuals na lumabas na meron symptoms as a priority vs unvaccinated,"nanoticed ko na our government is now starting to punish individuals who are unvaccinated pero hindi ba ang unvaccinated ang dehado? they have the biggest risk right now if they go out, giving them more chances to get severe case of covid. pero tayong vaccinated, less chances of severe type of covid. not zero chance of covid. and everyone is still a potential carrier of the disease. pero i can see a lot of people working right now sa labas na may sipon at ubo. eto ung nakakaspread ng sakit pero no one is telling them sa bahay po muna kayo magquarantine kasi baka covid yan at nakakahawa. hindi ba mas dapat ipriority ito vs unvaccinated. or do a proper marketing sa pinas, if may sipon or ubo or trankaso, ok lang na di muna pumasok or wag ka na lumabas muna. ang sipon at ubo at pedeng makahawa ng iba, blah blah. alam ko turo ng mga magulang or prof natin dati, ubo sipon lang yan, kung sila nga mamatay na kayod parin para lang mabuhay or pumasok sa school etc. pero it's not the mentality na you are weak for not working or going to school but because you can be a carrier that can infect more people. edit: best explanation why we are encouraging vaccination to the unvax: https://www.reddit.com/r/philippines/comments/s3lvv3/my_proposal_is_penalized_individuals_na_lumabas/hslons9/ why providing sick leave is important and the current situation sa country natin why di mabigyan basta basta: https://www.reddit.com/r/philippines/comments/s3lvv3/my_proposal_is_penalized_individuals_na_lumabas/hsloul0/ also i want to clarify that i didn't post this to discourage people from getting vaccinated. get vaccinated if hindi ka pa vaccinated. this will prevent you from getting too sick or die from covid. magastos magkasakit. but the increase in numbers in covid right now isn't caused by the unvaccinated people but people who go out with symptoms (whether vaccinated or not vaccinated sila). we started to become too lenient and confident na basta bakunado ok na. it takes everyone to be considerate to not go out or not go to work physically if you are sick or has symptoms to prevent possible transmission of any type of viruses (whether if it's the regular flu or covid). yun ang gusto ko ipoint out dito.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/s3lvv3/my_proposal_is_penalized_individuals_na_lumabas/,14 01 2022

My two cents on the rising Covid cases here in PH and why we shouldn't be complacent.,"first of all, this not a fear mongering post. pretty sure actual cases never really significantly decreased these past months to last year. it's just that most cases weren't recorded for they're either asymptomatic or with just very mild symptoms not needing to get tested simply because of the vaccines working and the common variants are getting weaker. but we shouldn't ignore the recent increasing cases here in ph. there's a reason why the number of recorded cases is increasing again and it's because more people are getting tested. why are these people getting tested? coz their symptoms are more likely beyond just mild. kapag simpleng sipon naman hindi ka na magpapatest diba? again, i'm not trying to scare anyone. i'm not forcing anyone to mask up. i myself don't wear mask everytime anymore. let us not panic, but at the same time don't be complacent. (honestly not sure if tama gamit ko ng ""complacent"" hahaha pasok mga grammar nazi) keep an aye out. unless the government is faking the increasing recorded cases? well sana. all i can say now is... ""it's not over anywhere until it's over everywhere."" edit: coz iba iba tayo ng exp w/ covid. i lost my father because of covid. my eldest brother passed away early this year and i’m pretty sure it’s related to covid long term effects. i myself is suffering from heart palpitations months after catching the virus back in 2021. so you can’t blame me if i’m still keeping an eye out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/139w6qz/my_two_cents_on_the_rising_covid_cases_here_in_ph/,6 05 2023

Story time: Uninformed News Edition,"a friend showed me a tiktok video of a supposed influencer sharing his thoughts on covid. the video (with embedded texts) went like this: ""storytime: covid 19 edition and then dinala sa hospital, dead on arrival. then sabi nung doctor sa mga kamag anak. kung papayag yung family na ang ilagay sa death cert nung namatay ay covid instead of heart attack 😱😱. so yun lang, idk what to do with that information kaya skl."" let me answer you, what you should do with that information is ask someone who is knowledgeable on the topic or at least someone who knows more than you do, cause you definitely don't know a lot. what you should not do though is post a video putting the hospital and medical professionals in a malicious light. for those of you who wants to be educated on the topic: anyone who is symptomatic, we can't mix with those who do not have the symptoms. ubo, sipon, lagnat, hirap sa paghinga, pananakit ng kasukasuan, pagsusuka, pagtatae or pagkawala ng pang-amoy at panlasa. you might be wondering, eh ang daming sakit with the same symptoms. yes, kaya nga po puno ang emergency rooms and covid floors. unless proven na negative ka sa covid (with rt-pcr), it is prudent that we don't place you with those without the symptoms. hospital protocols also dictates that anyone who arrives dead will be tagged as covid suspect (relating to the tiktok vid, paano nasabing heart attack? may ckmb ka? may trop i ka? may ecg ka ba???). covid also complicates underlying conditions like heart, brain problems which might have led to the demise of the patient. did the patient die of a heart problem? possible. did the patient die of covid? possible. hindi sya exclusive, and unless we do post-mortem swab, we will not know. the government ideally should fund more research centers and laboratories, to make testing more available kahit sa maralita. sayang yung mga inutang. hindi lahat ng tao afford ang 2-5k na rt-pcr swab na may 7 days validity lang. pag may rt-pcr ka na timely ang collection, you need not be tagged as suspect and can be treated sa covid negative area, therefore decongesting the covid suspect area, therefore freeing some resources that can be used for those in critical conditions. i am all for freedom of expression, but i also believe in responsible posting. supposed ~influencers~ should help us eradicate misinformation, use their platform for greater good. you also address your audience well. isang taon na tayong lockdown, ang dami nang dinagdag na letra sa cq. baka naman po? if you have any questions, if in any way i can explain things in simpler terms. i also urge people in the medical field to answer people the simplest way possible, to be ""patola"" na. our job extends way outside the corners of the hospital. di na lang covid ang kalaban, bad governance, ignorance and misinformation too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/mgihgq/story_time_uninformed_news_edition/,30 03 2021

Allowing minors to go outside amidst Covid-19,"hi. gusto ko lang maglabas ng sama ng loob. nanggigigil ako. bakit open sila sa suggestion na payagan na ang mga bata na lumabas, especially pumasyal? where the h did that came from? wala na bang covid? ubo't sipon lang ba yung covid? kung ganito rin lang pala, bakit di na lang buksan ang mga schools para sa face-to-face classes? i'm sure mas masusunod ang protocols doon kesa sa mga malls, parks etc. masasayang yung ilang buwan na inilagi natin sa bahay. masasayang yung ilang buwan na pakikipaglaban ng mga health professionals. bakit kailangan pang pag-usapan? dapat automatic 'no' na yan. yung sa work, okay lang eh. pero yung para mamasyal? sobra naman! tapos cases will surge after holiday season, sino na namang kawawa? yung mga health professionals. bakit ba hindi sila pinapakinggan? hirap na hirap na sila. tapos puro sarap at luho lang ang iniisip ng iba. ang dahilan nila, naiinip na daw ang mga bata? sa dami ng pwedeng gawin ng mga bata sa bahay, maiinip sila? sana naman hindi puro sarili ang iniisip nila. wag din sanang idahilan ang pasko o dahil ang pasko ay para sa mga bata. we can always make the most out of christmas kahit nasa bahay lang. i'm sure mas gusto ng mga bata na kasama ang magulang nila, mga kapatid kesa gumala. at matalino ang mga bata ngayon, alam nila kung anong nangyayari sa paligid. now, pag sinabi natin na pwede ng lumabas, what would they think? okay na? wala ng covid? i'm so frustrated. what about you guys?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/k4x3kj/allowing_minors_to_go_outside_amidst_covid19/,1 12 2020
My proposal is penalized individuals na lumabas na meron symptoms as a priority vs unvaccinated,"nanoticed ko na our government is now starting to punish individuals who are unvaccinated pero hindi ba ang unvaccinated ang dehado? they have the biggest risk right now if they go out, giving them more chances to get severe case of covid. pero tayong vaccinated, less chances of severe type of covid. not zero chance of covid. and everyone is still a potential carrier of the disease. pero i can see a lot of people working right now sa labas na may sipon at ubo. eto ung nakakaspread ng sakit pero no one is telling them sa bahay po muna kayo magquarantine kasi baka covid yan at nakakahawa. hindi ba mas dapat ipriority ito vs unvaccinated. or do a proper marketing sa pinas, if may sipon or ubo or trankaso, ok lang na di muna pumasok or wag ka na lumabas muna. ang sipon at ubo at pedeng makahawa ng iba, blah blah. alam ko turo ng mga magulang or prof natin dati, ubo sipon lang yan, kung sila nga mamatay na kayod parin para lang mabuhay or pumasok sa school etc. pero it's not the mentality na you are weak for not working or going to school but because you can be a carrier that can infect more people. edit: best explanation why we are encouraging vaccination to the unvax: https://www.reddit.com/r/philippines/comments/s3lvv3/my_proposal_is_penalized_individuals_na_lumabas/hslons9/ why providing sick leave is important and the current situation sa country natin why di mabigyan basta basta: https://www.reddit.com/r/philippines/comments/s3lvv3/my_proposal_is_penalized_individuals_na_lumabas/hsloul0/ also i want to clarify that i didn't post this to discourage people from getting vaccinated. get vaccinated if hindi ka pa vaccinated. this will prevent you from getting too sick or die from covid. magastos magkasakit. but the increase in numbers in covid right now isn't caused by the unvaccinated people but people who go out with symptoms (whether vaccinated or not vaccinated sila). we started to become too lenient and confident na basta bakunado ok na. it takes everyone to be considerate to not go out or not go to work physically if you are sick or has symptoms to prevent possible transmission of any type of viruses (whether if it's the regular flu or covid). yun ang gusto ko ipoint out dito.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/s3lvv3/my_proposal_is_penalized_individuals_na_lumabas/,14 01 2022

&#x200b; ang tinutukoy kong mga ""rules"" ay mga simpleng observations ko lamang sa kanya. mga bagay na hindi naman niya ipinagbabawal o dine-demand pero mas maganda kung alam mo. ito ang susi ng aming napakasaya at very smooth na relationship. hindi ba't may kasabihan tayo na, ""ang nagsasama nang matapat at sumusunod sa mga rules ng girlfriend niya, nagsasama nang maluwat."" &#x200b; heto ang mga simpleng rules kaya't perfect ang relationship namin ng aking perfect girlfriend. konti lang naman sila: &#x200b; rule #1. ayaw na ayaw ng girlfriend ko ang mga simbahan. hindi kasi siya religious at ang sabi niya, na-trauma raw siya dahil pinalaki siya ng kanyang lola na super relihiyosa. isa yatang panatiko ang lola niya na miyembro ng isang religious group sa probinsya nila na masasabing parang kulto na nga. kaya't kapag nakakakita siya ng mga churches (kahit anong religion), parang sumasama ang pakiramdam niya. isang beses nga, dumaan ako sa isang kalsada na hindi pamilyar sa akin. ang sabi kasi ng ka-opisina ko, shortcut daw iyon. kaya hindi ko alam na mayroon palang simbahang dadaanan. pagdaan na pagdaan ng kotse ko sa tapat ng simbahan, biglang nagtitili ang girlfriend ko. nagpupumiglas siya, parang nasasaktan ang buong katawan. grabeng trauma siguro ang sinapit niya sa kamay ng lola niya kaya ganoon ang reaksyon niya. kaya binilisan ko ang pagpapatakbo ng kotse ko hanggang sa makalayo kami roon. saka lamang siya huminahon. umiiyak siya, humihingi ng sorry. naiintindihan ko naman siya, wala siyang kasalanan. biktima lamang siya. hinaplos ko ang kanyang buhok at pinunasan ang kanyang mga luha. doon ko lang napansin na namumula ang kanyang noo at mga pisngi. pati mga braso niya ay namumula rin. nang pansinin ko ito, ang sabi niya ay baka nauntog siya o naihampas ang mga braso sa dashboard o sa bintana noong nagpupumiglas siya. niyaya ko siyang dalhin sa ospital pero tumanggi siya. sasabihin ko sanang imposibleng nauntog siya dahil hindi naman mukhang mga pasa ang nasa kanyang mukha at mga braso kundi mukha itong parang nasunog ngunit bigla siyang ngumiti, ang kanyang perpektong mga ngiti, kaya't nakumbisi na rin ako na okay na siya. pagkauwi namin, wala nang anumang bakas sa kanyang mukha na nauntog siya. &#x200b; kaya't kapag bumabiyahe kami, kailangang planuhin ang rutang dadaanan namin at siguraduhing hindi kami malalapit sa anumang simbahan. &#x200b; rule #2. hindi kumakain ng gulay ang girlfriend ko. siguro naman, marami sa inyo ganito ang mga girlfriend. mahilig sa meat pero ayaw kumain ng gulay. nakakatuwa, hindi ba? ako rin naman hindi masyadong mahilig sa gulay. kaya't kung kakain kami o lalabas, laging meat ang kinakain namin. hilig nga niya 'yung mga unli na barbecue. lalo na 'yung mayroong mga lamanloob. paboritong-paborito niya ang atay, intestines, puso, utak, at kung anu-ano pa. mahilig din siya sa dinuguan. minsan nga, isinama niya ako sa isang exclusive restaurant. mga members lang daw ang pwedeng kumain doon at miyembro siya at ang kanyang mga parents. nasa isang subdivision ito na puro mayayaman lamang ang nakatira. sa labas, mukha lang itong malaking mansyon pero pagpasok mo, isa pala itong restaurant. grabe, mayayaman talaga ang mga kumakain doon. may nakita pa nga akong mga artista at mga pulitiko. &#x200b; ang specialty ng restaurant na iyon ay mga lamanloob. tuwang-tuwa ang girlfriend ko nang orderin niya ang soup number 5. pinakain niya sa akin iyon at pinaubos dahil aphrodisiac daw iyon. masaya ko namang sinunod ito kahit na first time ko kumain noon. excited din ako dahil siguradong mapapalaban ako sa mangyayaring bakbakan pagkauwi namin. medyo natigilan lang ako noong una kong makita. ang alam ko kasi, ang main ingredient ng soup number 5 ay ari at bayag ng isang kalabaw. pero, noong pagsandok ko, parang iba ang nakita ko. parang iba ang hugis, parang malapit sa tao. pero siyempre, hindi ko na 'yun pinansin at siguradong imahinasyon ko lamang iyon. &#x200b; rule #3. hindi mahilig magpa-picture at mag-selfie ang aking girlfriend. ayaw na ayaw niya na kuhanan siya ng litrato, lalo na kung stolen. kaya nga kapag lumalabas kami, lagi siyang naka-cap at naka-long sleeves na jacket na may hoodie (ayaw niya rin kasi ang naaarawan). noong bago pa lamang kami, sinubukan ko siyang kuhanan ng picture nang palihim. pagtingin ko, nagtaka ako dahil parang deformed ang hitsura niya sa larawan. ni-restart ko ang phone ko at inulit pero ganoon pa rin. kaya tumabi ako sa kanya at mabilis na kumuha ng selfie. grabe ang galit niya sa akin! pinagsusuntok niya ako pero tinanggap ko ang lahat hanggang sa mawala ang galit niya. mga six months din bago ko nakita 'yung picture sa phone ko. inabot din kasi ng six months bago natanggal ang cast sa mga braso at binti ko. &#x200b; pagtingin ko sa picture na kinuha ko (kinuha ng girlfriend ko 'yung cellphone ko at itinago pero nakita ko rin naman sa closet niya noong makalabas ako sa ospital), naguluhan ako sa nakita ko. sa larawan, nakatingin ako sa camera at nakangiti. sa tabi ko, may isang matandang babae ang nakaupo. kulubot na ang kanyang mga mukha at kulay abo na ang mga buhok. suot-suot niya ang favorite t-shirt ng nobya ko. &#x200b; napailing na lang ako sa nakita ko. bilib na bilib pa naman ako sa camera ng iphone pero mukhang nagma-malfunction din pala ito. kaya ngayon, samsung na ang telepono ko. hindi ko na rin kinuhanan pa ng litrato ang girlfriend ko. &#x200b; rule #4. huwag magpapakita ng kabaitan sa ibang mga babae. ops! baka isipin niyo na selosa at mahigpit ang girlfriend ko. naku, diyan po kayo nagkakamali. sa katunayan, ayos lang sa kanya na makipagkaibigan ako sa mga babae. hindi siya nagagalit o nagtatampo. naalala ko nga noon, mayroon akong naging kaibigang babae sa trabaho, si carla. siyempre, tayong mga lalaki, natural na friendly tayo sa mga kababaihan. accomodating tayo at mahilig magbiro at mag-joke. madalas tuloy ay pinaghihinalaan tayo ng ating mga girlfriends. pero, iba ang girlfriend ko. ayos lang sa kanya ang ganoon. kahit nakikita niyang magkasama kami ni carla at nagtatawanan kapag bumibisita siya sa office, hindi siya nagagalit. nakakalungkot nga lang na hindi na natin kapiling si carla ngayon. natagpuan na lang siya isang umaga sa kuwarto niya, patay na. noong bumisita ako sa burol niya, nasabi sa akin ng kapatid niya na na-overdose daw sa gamot si carla. pagpasok daw nila sa kuwarto niya, nakita nila si carla na nakahiga sa kama, bumubula ang bibig. sa tabi niya, maraming nagkalat na gamot. puro tusok din ng karayom ang buong katawan niya. marahil daw, dahil sa depresyon o anumang mental illness, tinusok-tusok ni carla ang sarili niya ng karayom at pagkatapos ay uminom ng maraming gamot. ang nakapagtataka lamang daw, wala silang nakitang anumang karayom sa kuwarto ni carla. &#x200b; gaya nga ng sabi ko, hindi selosa ang girlfriend ko. marami akong mga naging kaibigang babae. nandyan si cherry na dating classmate ko noong college. marahil ay nakita mo siya sa balita. isang gabi kasi, habang papauwi galing trabaho, may tumulak daw sa kanya kaya nasagasaan siya ng isang bus. naging close ko rin si june at si barbie. kaso lang, maaga silang kinuha ni lord. bigla na lang silang na-comatose at hindi na nagising. over-fatigued daw sabi ng mga doktor. &#x200b; inaasar nga ako ng mga kaibigan ko ngayon na under daw ako ng girlfriend ko kaya hindi ako nakikipagkaibigan sa mga babae. pero ayos lang naman sa akin. mas masaya akong tawaging under kaysa naman magkaroon ng mga babaeng kaibigan pagkatapos... &#x200b; rule #5. kapag nagising ka sa madaling araw at nakita si girlfriend na naghahanap ng pagkain at mukhang gutom na gutom, magtago sa closet o kaya'y tumalon sa bintana. nakakatawa itong experience na ito. bakit ba ang mga babae, laging gutom? tapos, kapag pinakain mo masaya na kaagad sila? &#x200b; nagising ako isang beses mga alas-tres 'yata iyon. may narinig kasi akong mga kalampag kaya bumangon ako. wala rin kasi si girlfriend sa tabi ko. sa kusina ko siya nakita, hinahalughog ang ref namin. kaso, hindi pa kami nakakapag-grocery dahil wala pang sahod. &#x200b; tiningnan niya ako, nakakunot ang noo niya. ""gutom na ako,"" sabi niya. kahit gutom, sobrang ganda pa rin niya. kaya hindi ko napansin na tumutulo na pala ang laway niya. &#x200b; siyempre, ayokong nagugutom ang girlfriend ko kaya agad akong tumawag para magpa-deliver. pero, hindi na nakapagpigil pa ang girlfriend ko. sobrang gutom na siya, eh. kaya, ayun! &#x200b; pagkatapos niyang kumain, sobrang saya na niya. &#x200b; anyways, naging maayos naman ang lahat. ngayon, alam ko na ang gagawin kapag nakita siyang ganoon kaya wala naman na kaming naging problema pa. at saka, pwede namang mabuhay na isa lang ang kidney mo, hindi ba? basta't sisiguraduhin ko lang na hindi na ito mauulit pa. nag-iisa na lang ang natitira, eh. &#x200b; oh, napakadali lamang namang tandaan, 'di ba? 'yung ibang girlfriend diyan, napaka-demanding, ang dami-daming gusto, ang dami-daming ayaw. pero girlfriend ko, simple lang. simple pero perfect. kaya napakasaya ko sa kanya, eh. hindi ko na siya papakawalan. at siguradong-sigurado ako na hinding-hindi na niya ako papakawalan. &#x200b; edit: sa mga nagco-comment po at concerned sa akin, huwag po kayong mag-alala. ayos lang po ako. masaya, rewarding, at healthy ang relationship naming dalawa. oo, aaminin ko na medyo underweight ako ngayon nang kaunti (malnourished daw sabi ng doktor pero ano ba namang alam ng doktor? gusto lang akong pagka-perahan 'nun, eh!). medyo napapadalas din akong atakihin ng anemia (although hindi naman ako anemic dati, weird). pero, overall, perfect and happy kaming dalawa. &#x200b; tunay na love ko ang girlfriend ko!!! &#x200b; please subscribe to my pinoy horror animation channel!!! yt: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnaflx-rcdu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnaflx-rcdu)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/oiwuig/perpekto_ang_girlfriend_ko_basta_susundin_mo_lang/,12 07 2021
All of my loved ones are sick,"both parents are sick. relatives are sick. my girlfriend's also sick. wtf is happening? is this covid or it's just flu season? fortunately, ako lang walang sakit samin. siguro asymptomatic ako if positive nga kami. like i'm 100% fine even though i'm exposed to them kasi ayaw nila mag isolate, we even eat lunch and dinner together every day 🤡. nakakainis lang kasi, i told them to get tested pero they keep disregarding that they may have covid. like putangina we have the privilege to get tested for free (company benefits ni papa). habang yung ibang tao eh nag hihirap kasi they can't afford to be tested. they keep insisting that it's just flu plus the dust they inhaled from cleaning. if ever we're positive nga, this would be the second time. ganito rin sila nung una kaming nag ka covid, sipon lang daw. ayun, kung hindi ko pa pinilit mag pa test hindi sila maniniwala. kainis lang kasi walang sense of urgency.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/rznixz/all_of_my_loved_ones_are_sick/,9 01 2022
Pwede ba magpa-vaccine kahit may sinat?,"yung dad ko may runny nose at sipon since friday, at ngayon may sinat na (37.8). though may history naman talaga sya na sipunin, at lately kasi natutuyuan ng pawis dahil sa sobrang init at lagi hindj naka tshirt/sando. kung may sinat pa rin sya bukas (hopefully wala na), papayagan ba sya magpa-vaccine jab? bukas na kasi yung schedule nila ng 2nd dose ng astra.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/o468hv/pwede_ba_magpavaccine_kahit_may_sinat/,20 06 2021
I need advice regarding covid,"uncle ni wife died last saturday and most likely postive siya( waiting pa kami na e swab ). now before pa namatay si uncle my wife got a fever, konting ubo, sipon at irritation sa throat kaya nag self quarantine siya. from aug. 20 to 23. also never nawalan ng panlasa both si uncle and wife. ok na pakiramdam niya nang 24 kaya bumalik na siya sa amin (though di pa din siya lumalapit at tumatabi sa anak namin. if ever lumalapit siya nag mamask siya) &#x200b; question is: now that her uncle died and he is most probably positive should i put her back under quarantine? may direct contact kasi siya sa uncle ko and i am worried na baka talagang nahawa siya ng covid kaya siya nilagnat nung aug 20. both me and my wife are fully vaccinated but our son is not (5years old). currently wala kaming nararamdaman kahit anak namin.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/pdysbx/i_need_advice_regarding_covid/,29 08 2021
Middle class ang talo sa Pilipinas,"tuwing sakuna, pag mayaman ka, may pera ka kahit di ka aasa sa gobyerno. pag mahirap ka, bibigyan ka ng pera ng gobyerno. pero pag middle class ka, gagatasan kalang ng pera pero kung kailangan mo ng tulong, wala kang makukuha kasi ""may kaya ka naman."" i just saw my working parent's tax at sobrang laki parang di na ata makatarungan lalo na at ni pisong ayuda wala kami makuha nung bagyo, lockdown, at kung ano anong sakuna. nakakapanlumo maging lower middle class dito sa pinas at kitang kita ito during covid-19 lockdown. di naman sa pagiging elitista pero seryoso na usapan, bakit yung mga anak ng anak dito todo sinusuportahan ng gobyerno imbes na i educate about contraceptives? yung mga literal na palamunin (sugalero at may bisyo) pa ang binibigyan ayuda habang yung mga taong nagtatrabaho at nag contribute sa tax ay di manlang ma bigyan. ansakit lang sa dibdib makita na after covid-19 lockdown punong puno ang bentahan ng phone, salon, at kung ano ano pa nung nabigyan sila ng 6k na ayuda para dapat i imbak nila ng pagkain. isama nyo nadin nung bagyong odette, nasiraan din kami pero ni piso wala din binigay kasi nga diba ""may kaya"" daw. at yung mas nakakapanlumo is, yung mga mayayaman na loansharks, pineprendahan ng mga 4ps member ng atm card nila. what's worse? ang mga anak ng 4ps member nato ay di parin bayad ang bills sa school at most of them di padin marunong bumasa at magsulat. so how is this effective kung sabihin natin sa 10 na binibigyan, isa lang ang success story? no, this needs to be reevaluated! lastly, sa scholarships. palagi di makakaavail ang middle class kasi isa sa requirements ay maging ""poor,"" do we need to be below the poverty line before the government will even care about us? i have to be a working student to make ends meet and yung ibang naka avail nga nung scholarship daw ay either successful, not even good in school, or just close sa kay political person. nakakainip na talaga to sobra. walang pag asa kung middle class ka sa pinas. thanks for reading. i meant no hate. just pouring my heart out about the issues i see everyday here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/vvd0gr/middle_class_ang_talo_sa_pilipinas/,9 07 2022

My thanksgiving dinner experience with a BBM family.,"so eto nga guys, nag-punta kami (me (f), my wife (f) my sister and her bf) reluctantly sa invitation ng ilocano-bbm tita na kapit-bahay namin. may pinag-samahan naman yung family kahit papano, before elections super ganda ng communication namin sa kanila kasi kapitbahay namin dito sa canada. saktong usapan lang, nag-dasal kami bago kumain. to be honest, ang ganda nung prayer. as an agnostic, na-appreciate ko naman siya. pero gagi, yung kapatid ko brining-up yung pag-unfriend ko sa tito ko na misogynistic bbm supporter din tapos sabi sakin bigla nung bbm na tita: ""kayo kasi maka-leni kayong lahat diba? dapat di na kayo nagpapa-niwala sa kwento kwento lang. dapat sa totoong news sources lang."" mind you, binigyan ko lang siya nuon ng heads-up na fake yung website source niya (halatang fake kasi no actual sources from credible organizations, news sites, people, also the ones she sent me usually walang https:// (unsecure-doesnt mean all with https:// are legit as well) tapos yung design nung buong site, parang cult na may agila, illuminati sht - web designer and dev ako) tapos kinimkim pala niya yun. di ko nalang tinuloy yung pag-rebut ko kasi yung wife ko natatakot na magalit ako. i was very polite about it kasi mas matanda siya sakin and i was just looking out for her. then na-bring up nanaman ng kapatid ko about yung recently nangyari kay leila de lima. gagi nagulat ako sabi ng panganay niyang babae, ""dapat pinatay na nila yun. tinuluyan na dapat sinaksak."" sabay silang pamilyang tumawa (aside sa bunso na awkward sa situation) i felt chills. paanong nakakapag-dasal ng ganun kaganda tapos without any hesitations, would wish harm on other people just like that. ps. sinabihan din nung bbm tita yung mom ko directly bakit ako nag-cocomment and nag-popost na kumakalaban sa views niya. tas sabi ni bbm tita ""isang post mo nalang eh sasampalin na kita."" sabay tawa. eto din isang kinagalit ko sila yung traditional toxis filipino family. lakas nilang i-body shame yung asawa ko sa harap ko? muntik na talaga nag-liparan ang mga lumpia. anyways, officially cut ties with them na. may bbm supporter akong mga kakilala pero not that extreme (madalas dahil lang kasi ilocano. &nbsp; &nbsp; (edit) just to answer some questions. &nbsp; > quote q1. why was politics bough up nung dinner? i did not want to talk about politics because i knew it was going to be a mess, pero my sister thought our casual arguments sa fb nuon nung tita is civil and casual. she thought wrong. she had no idea the tita was extremely pro-marcos. she tried to change the topic but we decided na umalis bago magka-gulo (because i get really unpleasant pag nasimulan ko nang magalit and isa yun sa puna ng wife ko sakin kaya ayaw ko siya lalo ma-stress) anywho, lesson learned sa kapatid ko lol &nbsp; >quote q2. di bako sumagot or stoop up for what i believe in? i tried. di sa pag-tanggol sa pagkatalo or sa binoto ko, pero sa misinformation na nagbblur sa totoo at hindi. ang sagot sakin ""naniniwala ka kasi sa fake news. dun ka sa totoong balita lang. wag sa kwento kwento sa facebook at tiktok."" can't argue with people who always things they're right. siya nag-banggit na kay leni kami nag-vote last election and my side of the family all nodded (said ""yes. syempre tita."") then she proceeded to complain about the philippines being poor right now and then overcompensating sa pag-puri kay bbm after niya magreklamo. lol also i don't ever want to stoop low para makipag-sampalan at murahan sa harap nung bunso nila (na awkwardly listening to her mom talk about marcos. i guess she's the ""odd"" one in the family.) &nbsp; >quote q3. but they body-shamed your wife? di ka pumatol? as mentioned i can become harsh pag galit ako. my wife doesn't like me when i'm at that point of anger kaya we just looked at each other and signaled na umalis na. although i told them my wife is building strength kasi nag-ddeadlift siya. di nila alam ata kung ano yun. tbh nung tumahimik ako, napansin nung bf ng sister ko and akala daw nila may gagawin ako. i'm honestly surprised i held it in like that. i'm quite proud of myself. charot &nbsp; >quote q4. important ba sila sa inyo? nung bago-bago palang kami sa canada isa yung tita na nagshashare ng food niya samin sa work, nag-lolook out for us and genuinely concerned if we were okay. kaya masakit din na this happened. &nbsp; >quote q5. anong nangyari sa fresh lumpia? binigyan kami ng pa-take home pero wala na gusto kumain. binalik ko yung plate nila kahapon pero di ko na kinausap. iniwan ko nalang sa pinto nila. &nbsp; &nbsp; >quote edit: clarified that not all websites with ""https://"" are legit din.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/y1fwdi/my_thanksgiving_dinner_experience_with_a_bbm/,11 10 2022

(hindi nakakatulong ang punong ospital dito) 2. walang tulong pinansyal para sa mga negosyo. marami ng ngsara. pero siguro naman kung mag lolockdown tayo ng pangalawang beses may pondo na sila para dito. 3. kailangan ng isa pang sap. kailangan umikot ang pera. nung nalift ang ecq, back to normal ang sales ko. and sa tingin ko dahil ito sa sap. may pang gastos pa ang mga tao. iba na ang sitwasyon sa nakaraang 2ng linggo. 4. hindi pwedeng ang 50% economy 50% health approach. kung lockdown, lockdown talaga. kung economy pinili mo buksan mo lahat. dapat magfocus muna tayo sa isang problema dahil palpak ang approach na pag resolba ng covid at economiya ng sabay",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/i1rpny/why_will_a_second_lockdown_kill_the_economy/,1 08 2020
The 6th Stage: Defiance,"so, ayun na nga. ibang mundo na ang ating gigisingan. the dragon has fully reared its head. duterte coming into power in 2016 was but a tendril of smoke heralding the return of a marcos-with an all new cast of cronies! super. ngayon, sabay sabay natin matututunan ang totoong ibig sabihin ng pagtindig laban sa karimarimarim na dilim. tulad ng paglaban ng mga lolo’t lola, nanay, at tatay natin nung 1972. training wheels are off. totoo nga na papunta na tayo sa exciting part. nakakatakot. nakakapangilabot na yung dating mga binabasa mo lang, napapanuod mo lang sa dokyumentaryo, baka makita mo na sa mundong ginagalawan mo. nung una, i did not know how to cope, so lahat ng brand ng copium tinikman ko. hagulgol. galit. ang bobobo, ang tatanga! nangangako ng aalis na. alexa, show me afams in my area. but curiously, as the most turbulent of the emotions eased, something remained. tahimik lang siya habang inuubos ng kaluluwa ko ang kalungkutan. ngayon na humihina na, mas naririnig ko siya, unflinching and steadfast. i feel defiant, *in a way that i have never felt like in my life*. baka ang tadhana ni vp leni ay hindi ang manalo noong may 9, kundi sindihan ang totoong kilusan. marami satin, siguro parang namatayan ngayon. pero may nabuhay rin. it’s new, tentative. pero it is a force that cannot be denied. rivulets of water that will eventually cleave apart solid stone. yung grit ng mga tao na nanatili hanggang 6:30am para lang makaboto. this anger? this movement? it is ours. it is *us*. there is no taking it away. sabi nga ni vp leni, ang mulat, hindi na muli mapipikit. pretty words if heard a week ago. ngayon, habang hindi makatulog at makapigil sa pagluha ang marami satin, siguro mas naiintindihan natin ang bigat ng ibig niyang sabihin. it is painful because you know. i believe it is that pain and grief that will keep us moving. masakit maging mulat. masakit hindi bumitaw. madalas ko isipin kung paano ba ako magsusurvive sa rehimen na ganito. hindi ko alam ang lahat ng sagot, pero may apat ako na suggestion na pwede pagsimulan: first: alagaan ang sarili. mahaba pa ang gabi. kailangan maganda't gwapo tayo hanggang mag-umaga. eat well, exercise, hydrate, meditate, stay centered, cry if you need to, know when you need to step away. you will need all of yourself during the coming years. second: mag-ingat online. alam naman natin na kasama sa technique ang red-tagging and troll farms. ingatan ang sensitive and personal information. don’t give them anything to work with. third: digital budd(ies) system. kung ang social media ay tool na ginamit para ilubog tayo, that means we can also use it to work in our favor. gamitin para bumunot ng lakas sa isa’t isa. now is not the time to isolate yourself. if you’re not already doing so, follow inspirational folks like chel diokno and walden bello. kahit hindi lang para sa balita, kahit paalala lang na hindi ka nag-iisa. fourth: do not forget who is really at fault. may magandang video si atty luke espiritu sa page niya sa fb (bawal maglink, pero madaling mahanap) explaining why it is not the masses who are to blame. we gain *nothing* from alienating and attacking each other, while evil counts on us staying divided. yung mga nagsasabi na stop helping para mapressure yung gobyerno, i do not think that will work. this is a government that will not care. we will be punishing the wrong people, and their oppressors will twist the truth to turn us even harder against each other. kung vp leni supporter ka, tulad ng marami satin dito, you would be betraying the principles she stands for. kahit yung mga nakain ng fake news and misinformation, biktima lahat yan. hindi natin alam ilang taon unti-unting binabago ng propaganda ang perception nila ng katotohan. the machinery has been hard at work for years. palagay ko, ngayon palang natin totoong sisimulan ang pagrehabilitate. the real evil are the people who willfully and deliberately voted because they had power to gain. the real evil are the structures and elites who produced marcos jr. yakap. mahal kita at ipaglalaban kita, sa kung paano ko man kakayanin. stay safe, stay defiant, folks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/unpff9/the_6th_stage_defiance/,12 05 2022

[M]Y EXPERIENCE IN TUGUEGARAO CITY FLOODING. (Long post),"hello everyone! i'm from linao (east), tuguegarao city, yung sobrang lubog sa baha na barangay na trending sa buong social media. first and foremost, we[together with my fam & relatives] are safe from the flood(thanks god!). we are here at zone 2 of the barangay and yung totally flooded (lagpas bahay) is nasa zone 6 or 7, not quite sure. humuhupa na po ang baha at sana magtuloy-tuloy na. looking back at 11pm of nov. 13, 3 steps nalang po ng hagdan bago maabot ang 2nd floor ng bahay to think na elevated pa itong bahay so how much more na sa mga mabababang bahay, totally submerged na sila sa tubig baha. hindi makapasok ang mga rescuers dahil hindi kasya ang mga motorized rubber boats sa mga eskinita ng mga natrap na tao. idagdag mo ring zero visibility kasi napaka dilim dahil brownout sa buong lugar. iniisip na naming lumikas pero ang aking nanay at mga(3) tita ay kalmado lamang, nakahigang nasa likod ng ulo ang mga kamay at sabing ""sanay kami maligo sa dagat. huwag niyo kaming alalahanin, hindi kami aalis dito sa bahay"". sobrang nakakatakot sa labas kasi napakalakas ng agos ng baha, isang maling tapak at na-outbalance ka, siguradong buhay mo kaagad ang kapalit. we stayed in our house. i prayed nalang talaga na bumaba ang baha at pagsapit ng 2:37am ng nov.14, chineck ko yung pencil marks na ginawa ko ng 11pm sa dingding namin, bumaba pero almost 1 inch lang. (sobrang saya ko na dito kasi king ina at least bumaba na). tumuntong ako sa bubong ng sala namin na nasa bukana lang ng aming bintana, huminga ng malalim at napatulala sa mga bituin. sobrang dilim at tahimik ng paligid, ang tanging naririnig ko lamang ay mga tunog ng palaka. maya-maya, parang may mga naririnig akong mga boses ng tao at finocus ko ang pandinig sa mga iyon disregarding ang mga palaka, and wtf, ang naririnig ko na sinasabi ng mga tao ay ""rescue"" at ""tulong"" echoing all over our barangay in all directions. sobrang hina lamang ng naririnig ko dahil sa kalayuan ng mga taong sumisigaw. (kung napakinggan niyo yung 17sec clip ng mga tao sa social media na sumisigaw ng ""rescue"", yes that's all true. pero imagine hearing it personally from 3am to 4:30am, wala na talaga akong magagawa kundi ipagdasal na sana maabot na ng rescuers ang aking mga ka-barangay.) ako'y napraning at chineck ulit ang tubig ng 4:30am, bumaba pa ito ng 1 inch. i was so happy na sa span ng 5 hrs, bumaba ang tubig ng 2 inches. yes. 2. freaking. inches. my goodness! as of now, patuloy nang humuhupa ang baha. mababaw na ang tubig, hanggang dibdib na lamang sa labas ng bahay. i mean, may kalaliman parin pero kumpara nung peak ng baha, lagpas pa siguro kahit iangat ko ang aking kamay. approx 6-7ft (i'm 5'7 btw, alam ko to kasi bumili ako ng pagkain namin para dito sa bahay, hanggang leeg tas naka tip-toe ako sa tubig). note na sa zone 2 lamang po ito, sa ibang zones baka umabot ng 15-20ft. i'm writing this at 9pm of november 14, 2020(will probably post it late bc of signal issues), naghihintay ng mga ipamimigay na tubig-inumin dahil trapped parin po kami sa baha. gustuhin ko mang maging bridge of all donations for us here sa flooded area pero trapped parin po kami sa baha at kami rin po mismo ay nangangailangan ng tulong. i excluded all political aspects, didn't dig deep sa mga issues like ""nasaan si mayor"" issue, ""okay lang ang cagayan"" issue by governor, and kilala niyo na kung sinong tinutukoy kong gustong lumangoy. vp leni, u da real mvp being the 1st one to respond to our calls from the national politicians. (alam kong may kanya kanya tayong manok pero sana hindi tayo magbulag-bulagan) #2022 sobrang nakakatakot ang rumaragasang tubig ng baha, sana lagi po tayong mag-iingat. nakalimutan na po ng mga tao ang social distancing dahil hand in hand po kaming nakikipag-sapalaran at nakikipag-laban para sa buhay laban sa bahang ito. ito ang aking mga karanasan sa baha, pasensya kung may mali man kayong makita at mabasa. please pray for us. kapit lang. babangon ulit tayo. maraming salamat sa lahat ng tumulong, tumutulong at tutulong pa lalo na sa mga rescuers natin. this is the worst flood i've ever had. please be safe! #cagayanvalleyneedshelp #bangoncagayanvalley",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ju3w8l/my_experience_in_tuguegarao_city_flooding_long/,14 11 2020

Bakit nga ba galit ang tao sa (unofficial) pagkapanalo ni Marcos?,"simple: si marcos ay hindi basta kandidato lang. si marcos ay galing sa pamilyang nagnakaw sa, at gumahasa ng, bansa natin. opo, nakasulat 'yan sa kasaysayan at alam ng buong mundo. konting google lang at makikita ninyo lahat ng kawalanghiyaan ng pamilyang 'yan. ni hindi ko nga rin mawari kung papaano tayo umabot sa punto na kinekwestyon pa ang katotohanan ng martial law. makinig tayo sa mga documentaries at mga testimonyo ng mismong mga biktima ng martial law. magbasa tayo ng mga ebidensya na nagpapakita ng paglugmok ng ekonomiya ng pilipinas at kung gaano sila yumaman sa loob ng 21 years na nasa kapangyarihan sila (maaaring basahin: republic v. sandiganbayan. july 15, 2003). kung si ping, isko, leody, o kung sino man sa mga kandidato ang nanalo, wala namang problema. iintindihin naman ang pasya ng taong bayan. ang kaso, ang nakataya sa eleksyon na ito ay isang parte ng kasaysayan natin na maaaring mabura at makalimutan nang hindi pa nabibigyan ng hustisya. hindi naman natin maikakaila na ang lahat ng masamang patungkol sa martial law ay mababalewala sa pag-upo ni marcos. pano mo nga ba naman sisingilin ang pangulo sa lahat ng ill-gotten wealth at tax liabilities? pano mo nga ba naman aalalahanin ang edsa holiday kung ang pangulo mo ay isang marcos na ang pamilya ay pinatalsik mismo sa araw na yan? paano mo nga ba naman ituturo ang katotohanan sa panahon ng martial law sa loob ng classroom kung ang pangulo mo ay isang marcos? isang sagot: hindi na. nanggaling na rin sakanya yan. ""i have to protect my family"". at bago niyo sabihin na magmove-on nalang, andaming mga biktima ng martial law na hindi pa nabibigyan ng reparations. ni hindi pa nga tayo nakakarinig ng sorry man lang mula sa pamilya nila. ni hindi pa nga natin nababayaran lahat ng utang natin mula sa panahon ng ama niya habang sila, ang yaman yaman na. at masakit isipin na basta nalang makakalimutan ang kauna-unahang beses sa kasaysayan natin na ang nagpahirap ng sobra sa bansa natin ay isang pilipino. sige, pwede naman natin tanggapin ang pagkapanalo ni marcos. madali naman 'yun, mapagpatawad naman ang pilipino. pero sa bawat araw na hinahayaan nating bumalik sa kapangyarihan ang pamilyang 'to, unti-unti naring mababaon sa limot ang hinaing ng mga biktima. unti-unti naring mawawala ang pag-asa na maibalik ang ninakaw ng pamilya nila. unti-unti naring mawawala ang hustisya. at kung mangyari man na hihingi ng tawad at mabibigyan ng hustisya ni bbm ang mga biktima ng kanyang ama, at i-angat niya ang pilipinas, edi sige, handa akong ibigay ang respeto ko sakanya. patunayan niya na hindi talaga kasalanan ng anak ang kasalanan ng ama. alam kong nakakainis at nakakapikon na hindi nalang hinahayaan ang resulta ng eleksyon, pero sana alam natin na ang pasakit na ito ay bunga ng malasakit para sa bayan. p.s. pasensya na, just had to let this out of my chest kasi andaming annoying na tao. lol",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/uoh21a/bakit_nga_ba_galit_ang_tao_sa_unofficial/,13 05 2022

"alex, tanghaling tapat ng sabado, 2021","(any review for this is very-very much appreciated. i'm an aspiring writer po and i just launched a passion project anthology, isa po ito sa mga kwento) &#x200b; **chairman** ngayon ko lang naranasan ‘to sa tagal ko nang nanunungkulan sa barangay. isama mo na sa mga karanasang ‘yon ang lahat ng away mag-asawa, suntukan ng mga lasing, at mga batang ginagahasa sa bukiran. pero eto… ngayon ko lang napansin na buong araw ko na palang hinihimas ang rosaryong nakasabit sa leeg ko. maya’t-maya ko pa hinahalikan at binubulungan na sana’y wag mangyari sa pamilya ko ang nakita ko kanina. naririnig ko pa rin ang sigaw ni cecil, kumare’t-kapitbahay namin, tanghaling tapat ng sabado, kung saan ang tanghalian sa buong kalsada nami’y naantala dahil sa kanyang nakakakilabot na sigaw. sa ilalim ng nagbabagang init ay nagsitakbuhan kami upang sumaklolo. kinailangan ko pang iwanan ang tinola ni misis at ang isang basong softdrinks na nilalanguyan pa dalawang yelo nang ako’y tumakbo papunta sa bahay ni cecil. ngayo’y hindi pa rin ako kumakain. sa totoo nga’y hindi pa ako nakakaranas ng gutom. hindi ko pa ata kaya. sa bahay ni cecil ay dinatnan namin ang katawan ng panganay ni cecil na si joe na nakaratay sa braso ng kanyang bunsong kapatid na si alex, sa sahig ng kanilang sala. sa leeg ni joe ay nakabaon ang basag na bote na ginamit ni alex na balot na balot sa dugo ng kanyang kapatid. agad ang kapit at halik ko sa aking rosaryo nang makita ko ang imahe; na parang sinaunang obra na naglalahad ng malagim na kwento. pero ano ang kwento neto? hanggang ngayon ay wala pa rin kaming ideya kung bakit. magmula sa pagsigaw ni cecil ng, “anong nangyari?! anak, anong nangyari?!” sa tulalang alex na nakatitig sa dilat na mga mata ni joe, hanggang sa pagpunta namin dito sa aking opisina sa barangay, ay wala pa rin kaming makuhang rason mula sa bakit. sa isang maliit na kwarto sa aking opisina’y pinaupo ko muna si alex. tulala at sinusubukang burahin ang dugo sa kanyang mukha gamit ang duguan ring damit n’ya. hinainan ko ng isang bote ng softdrinks at tatlong pandesal mula pa sa agahan namin kanina si alex, na agad namang n’yang kinain ng walang pag-aalinlangan. dito na nagsimulang gumapang ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod. isang kilabot na hindi ko maipaliwanag, habang pinapanood ko si alex na walang awat sa pagkain, habang ako’y hindi ko pa rin magawang matakam sa masarap na lutong nag-aabang sa’kin sa bahay. “alex,” marahan kong sinabi. “ba’t mo ginawa ‘yun?” tumingin lamang sa’kin si alex, patay na mga mata, bibig na mabagal ang nguya. at sa kanyang paglunok ay walang mga salitang bumalik sa’kin. hindi ko alam kung bakit pero bigla kong naalala si jefferson, isang tricycle driver dito sa’min. dalawang taon na ang nakakalipas nang mapatay n’ya ang isang dayo na nakaaway n’ya sa kalsada. nangyari ‘to nang kamuntikan n’yang makasalpukan ang sasakyan ng dayo, at nang nahinto silang dalawa’y nagkasagutan muna sila bago mapikon si jefferson. hinampas n’ya ng bakal na tubo ang dayo. hindi na raw n’ya napigilan dahil sa mga mapanglait na mga salitang tinawag sa kanya. bobo, unggoy, uling, mababa. labing-isang beses paulit-ulit na hinampas ni jefferson sa ulo ang dayo, at sa sobrang lakas ng bawat hampas ay may parte na ng utak na lumabas dito. sa prisinto’y naalala ko si jefferson, iyak nang iyak at humihingi ng tawad dahil sa nangyari. hindi makakain, hindi rin makatulog. nilamon na s’ya ng konsensya n’ya, at ang konsensya n’ya ang tumulak sa kanya na agawin ang baril ng isa sa mga pulis na nagbabantay, at iputok sa kanyang sariling ulo. nasaktan si jefferson, nagalit, at di nakapagpigil. naintindihan ko ang kwento ‘nun. pero bakit hindi ko maintindihan ‘to? alam kong magkasundo ang magkapatid na ‘to. alam ko kung ga’no sila kalapit sa isa’t-isa. kaya pa’no nangyari ‘to? ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod ay gumagapang paakyat hanggang sa aking dibdib, tila ba kumakapit ng mahigpit. pasikip nang pasikip at medyo nahihirapan akong huminga. ang kakaibang pakiramdam na ‘to’y tumitindi habang nanatiling tahimik at nakatitig lamang sa’kin si alex. biglang iniabot ni alex ang kanyang kamay at dito tumalon na ang puso ko. napaatras ako sa aking kinauupuan, at mabilisan kong hinugot ang aking rosaryo mula sa pagkakatago nito sa aking damit. itinutok ko ito kay alex, na walang ibang kibo kun’di ang kunin ang bote ng softdrinks na nasa harapan n’ya. mas bumilis pa ang pagkatok sa aking dibdib, na para bang kamuntikan na kong mamatay. habang si alex nama’y pinapanood lang ako habang patuloy ang kanyang pag-inom. wala nga ata talagang mangyayari, at nang maramdaman ko kung gaano katahimik ang kwarto’y kumalma na ako. bakit sa dulo ng utak ko’y hinihiling ko na may sapi o di kaya’y isang demonyo talaga ang kaharap ko, at sa presensya ng aking rosaryo’y masasaktan s’ya. kahit anong kakaiba. kahit ano basta magkaroon lang ng eksplenasyon ang nangyari. pero siguro’y kakaiba na rin ang ikinikilos ng bata. at siguro nga’y mas dapat talaga akong matakot sa buhay kaysa sa patay. **cecil** “saan ba ko nagkulang?” tanong ni aling cecil sa mga kumare n’yang nakapalibot sa kanya sa masikip na opisina ni chairmain. napapaligiran din s’ya ng makukulay na mga pamaypay na hindi sabay-sabay ang pagaspas sa harap n’ya; nilulunod si aling cecil sa hangin. ang kanyang mukha nama’y tila ba isang rebulto ng santo kung punas-punasan ng mga panyo. “hindi ko pa rin maintindihan,” dugtong n’ya. “hindi naman ako nagkulang sa aruga. pareho ko namang pinapakita sa kanila na pantay ang pagmamahal ko sa kanila.” tuyo na ang mga mata ni aling cecil, ngunit tila ba hindi pa rin tapos ang kanyang pag-iyak. “hindi sila nag-aaway. hindi ko man lang narinig na nagtalo silang dalawa. o kung may pagtatalo man, malamang sa malamang maliit na bagay lang ‘yun. hindi yung ikakamatay mo!” isang labi ng lumapit sa tenga ni aling cecil, “alam mo tingin ko, baka inggit ‘yan. kasi si joe lang may trabaho sa kanilang dalawa, di ba? tapos si alex, wala pa rin sa kolehiyo. nag-aaral pa rin. sigurado akong ‘yun ang dahilan.” isa pang labi ang lumapit sa kabilang tenga naman ni aling cecil, “baka napikon na. kasi di ba halos s’ya na sa lahat ng gawaing bahay? baka pakiramdam n’ya porke’t mas malaki ambag ng kapatid n’ya , alila na s’ya neto.” isang labi naman na kaharap ni aling cecil ang nagsabing, “baka nagbabait-baitan lang kasi nga si joe ang halos sumasalo sa mga bayarin, pati sa pag-aaral n’ya. pero galit talaga s’ya, kasi baka naman may pagkakataong mas nabibigyang-atensyon si joe kahit hindi n’yo napapansin. kasi halimbawa uuwi s’yang pagod galing sa trabaho, syempre di n’yo maiwasang alagaan, pagsilbihan.” sa gitna ng mga labing ito’y si aling cecil, at ang ideyang unti-unting nabubuo dahil sa mga sinasabi ng mga labi sa kanya. “siguro,” sabi n’ya. “siguro nga.” **abbie** ang pangalan n’ya’y abbie. social worker daw s’ya. pagpasok n’ya’y agad bumungad sa’kin ang asul na bra sa ilalim ng dilaw na blouse nang tapatan ito ng liwanag mula sa bintanang katabi ko. sa kanyang pagtali ng buhok ay nakita kong basang-basa na ang kanyang kili-kili at kumikinang na sa pawis ang kanyang leeg. “alex?” sabi n’ya habang maya’t-mayang tinutulak ng kanyang daliri ang salamin n’yang dumudulas sa kanyang matangos na ilong. “bakit di mo ikwento muna sa’kin ang nangyari bago tayo umalis dito?” pasensya ka na, abbie. hindi ko nagawang sabihin kay chairman, na kilala pa mandin namin. hinding-hindi ko rin masasabi sa’yo. walang ibang maglalahad ng nangyari kun’di ang mga taong nais magbigay kahulugan dito, kasi kung ako tatanungin kung bakit, sa totoo lang, hindi ko rin alam ang isasagot. may nabasag akong bote sa kusina kanina, at sa pagpulot ko nito’y pumasok sa isip ko ang isang udyok. yung tipo ng udyok kapag nasa mataas kang lugar, at bigla mo na lang gustong itulak ang kasama mo. pero alam mong hindi ito dapat gawin, at kakapit ka pa nang mas mahigpit sa kanila para masiguro mong hindi ito mangyayari. ang udyok na ito’y nagsabi sa’kin na isaksak ko kay kuya ang basag na bote. at nalaman ko na lang na totoo na pala ang lahat nang dumapo sa aking balat ang mainit na dugo ni kuya. nahinto lang ako nang maramdaman ko ang buto sa leeg n’ya at nang marinig kong nabibilaukan na s’ya sa kanyang sariling dugo. hindi ko pa rin alam kung bakit. sana, tulad ng iniisip ni chairman, ay nasapian na nga lang ako. pero nakita ko ang lahat, andun ako. hindi ko lang alam na totoo pala ang lahat. namatay si kuya joe sa wala. at hindi ko matanggap na wala. normal lang sana ang sabado namin. tahimik. nanonood lang si kuya ng tv, naglilinis ako sa kusina. si nanay nama’y namamalengke ng pananghalian namin. bicol express daw ang lulutuin n’ya. puta, sinira ko ang araw. gusto kong umiyak dahil hindi na kami babalik sa salo-salo namin. “alex?” muling tawag ni abbie. “gusto kong malaman kung bakit. tayong dalawa lang. kaibigan mo ko dito. hinding-hindi ko ‘to sasabihin sa nanay mo, sa mga kapitbahay n’yo. may mga naririnig ako sa labas na dahil daw sa inggit? totoo ba ‘to? sa inggit nga? magmula nang dinala ako ni chairman dito sa maliit na kwartong ito’y napagpasyahan kong manahimik na lang sa nangyari. sa ngayo’y nilalabanan ko ang mga luha, nilalabanan ko ang panginginig ng aking bibig, at ang mga salitang gustong lumabas mula sa’kin. dapat mukhang hindi ko pinagsisisihan. dapat mukha akong galit. para naman mabigyang halaga, mabigyan ng ibig-sabihin ang pagkamatay ni kuya joe. dapat tinatatak ko sa utak ko na dapat lang! dapat lang sa kanya ang nangyari. dapat hindi ako bibigay. dahil kapag natalo ako, mamatay talaga sa wala si kuya. “sige, kung ayaw mong magkwento, ako muna. kasi naalala ko ‘tong isang batang babae at ang tatay n’yang abusado. tatay n’yang lasinggero. tatay n’yang isang beses s’yang hinipuan sa kanyang sariling kwarto at pinilit. ampon ang batang ‘yon, at tatay-tatayan n’ya lang etong umaabuso sa kanya. takot na takot ang bata dahil pakiramdam n’ya isang gabi’y papatayin na lang s’ya bigla neto. kaya naman isang gabi, nang bigla s’yang pinuntahan ng kanyang tatay upang pagsamantalahan ulit, sinasaksak ito ng bata gamit ang lapis sa mata, sa leeg, at sa dibdib.” kumuha ng panyo si abbie. sa kanyang paggalaw ay muling sumisilip ang kanyang bra sa likod ng blouse na parang mga batang naglalaro sa likod ng kurtina. “masarap sa pakiramdam, pero pumapatay pa rin s’ya ng tao. ilan taon n’yang dinibdib ‘yun. hanggang ngayon nararamdaman pa rin n’ya ang mga kamay ng tatay n’ya sa kanyang ari. sa kanyang dibdib. ilang taon bago n’ya matanggap ang ginawa n’ya. ngayon, medyo mahirap pa ring ikwento, pero kahit papaano’y kaya ko na. nangyari na kasi.” para bang may sumuntok sa aking dibdib nang marinig ko ‘to. bigla kong tinanggal ang aking paningin sa kanyang bra, at sa paggalaw ng aking mga mata’y bigla kong naramdaman ang pamumuo ng mga luha. “ayos lang, alex. pero andito lang ako. aalagaan ka muna namin. tapos pag handa ka na, makikinig ako. kahit pakonte-konte pa, ayos lang. aantayin kong mabuo ang kwento mo.” bumibilis bigla ang tibok ng puso ko. lalong nanginginig ang aking labi. at biglang pumasok si kuya sa isip ko, tumatakbo papalayo sa akin. mga bata pa kami, at hinahabol ko s’ya. “alex?” kuya wag kang lumayo! “alex?” kuya dito ka lang! kailangan kita dito! “sige, ayusin na natin pag-alis mo.” at parang isang batang nadapa sa semento, dito na walang awat na tumulo ang luha sa aking mga mata. “alex?” “hindi ko rin alam… hindi… ko rin alam. sorry, kuya! sorry! hindi ko rin alam kung bakit! patayin n’yo na lang ako! hindi ko alam anong nangyari! hindi ko na kaya!” lumalabo na ang aking paningin, pero kahit ga’no kalabo ang aking mga mata’y kitang-kita ko ang gulat at takot sa mukha ni abbie. pasensya ka na, kuya.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/nlygsa/alex_tanghaling_tapat_ng_sabado_2021/,27 05 2021

Sabi sa akin ng Ante ko ay hindi ako tunay na Engineer dahil walang board exam yung couse ko.,"(***aita for arguing with my boomer aunt over the fact that she claimed i wasn't a true engineer and devalued my nearly three years of work experience in the logistics and supply chain industry by indicating it wasn't profitable****)*. &#x200b; minsan na rin ba kayong binansagang '**bastos**' ng mga nakakatanda na sarado ang isipan sa mga bagay-bagay dahil nagbibigay ka ng mga punto patungkol sa mga karanasan na **mas** alam mo dahil hindi nila naranasan? ako kasi, oo. si ante (**auntie**) ay kilala naming relihiyoso, palasimba at masasabi mo na kapag gumuho ang mundo ay talagang malabo na mapunta sa impyerno dahil halos tatlong beses sa isang araw kung magrosaryo. isa siyang dh sa hong kong at isa namang assistant sa isang simbahang katoliko kada rest day niya. mataas ang respeto ko kay ante dahil sa hirap ng buhay ay nagawa nila ni tatay (nakababatang kapatid ni ante) noon na makapunta sa abroad para magtrabaho. marami na ring naipundar at nakapagpagawa ng bahay. ako naman ay isang simpleng tao lang, nagtapos ako ng kursong **industrial engineer** sa isang kilalang unibersidad sa luzon. bata pa lang kasi ako noon, sobrang naeengganyo ako magbyahe-byahe at maghahatid ng pagkain ng tatay at kuya ko kapag sila ay nasa bukid - masasabi ko na isa ito sa konsepto kung bakit ko pinili manatili at magtrabaho sa industriya ng logistics at supply chain. at noong nagtapos ako sa kolehiyo, ang una kong trabaho ay qc (quality control) engineer sa isang manufacturing company sa valenzuela. ngunit sa sobrang boring ng trabaho ay napilitan ako magresign at pinilit maghanap ng logistics o supply chain company at sa awa ng diyos ay nakahanap naman. dito, masasabi kong masakit sa ulo kasi madami kang kakausaping tao, dapat marunong ka magmando ng operations, magbigay ng tamang update kada oras at magbigay ng assurance sa mga business partners para mapanatili ang maayos na samahan. **maliit ang sahod?** oo. **masaya ba ako?** sobra. nagumpisa ang pangyayari sa pagtawag ko sa ante ko dahil gusto ko siya kumustahin. labis-labis ang pagkamiss ko sa kanya dahil mula ng 2020 ay hindi na siya nakauwi pa ng pilipinas dulot ng covid-19. bandang alas-siyete ng gabi noong october 30 ay napatawag ako. pagkasagot ng tawag, iniisip ko na bubungad sa akin yung linya niya lagi na ""hello, how are you?"" pero hindi, sermon kaagad. mga limang minuto ng paguusap namin ay patungkol sa pinsan ko na nakapag-abroad na at nagtapos bilang nurse at sa isang kakilala namin na masasabi kong marami ng work experience bilang mechanical engineer at 'board passer'. pagkwento niya ay hindi ko maiwasan na hindi maging komportable lalo na't palaging binabanggit na walang board exam ang ie o di kaya maliit lang daw ang sahod ng mga ie. ang tawag pa nga niya sa akin minsan ay **rider** o **delivery boy** kasi ang madalas kong sabihin ay nagtatrabaho ako sa industriya ng logistics at supply chain - at dahil hindi niya alam ang sinasabi ko, ginamit ko ang katagang '*nagpapadedeliver ng mga produkto sa mga mall, tindahan o warehouse*' para madali niya maintindihan yung konspeto ng trabaho ko. nabanggit pa nga na walang pera sa trabaho ko kahit pa pausbong pa lang ako sa sa professional career (almost 3 years work experience) ko at hindi ko nagustuhan ang mga sinabi - na hindi ako tunay na engineer dahil wala akong board exam. pinupunto ko sa kanya na kahit wala kang board exam ay pwede ka pa ring maging engineer. dito pa lang ay nagtataasan na kami ng boses. pinipilit pa rin na pumunta lang daw ako sa ie na course dahil takot ako sa board exam. nabanggit pa niya na hindi siya gaanong proud kasi hindi kilala yung course at hindi ganon katunog. binigyan ko ulit ng isa pang punto na sobrang importante ng mge ie sa mga kumpanya dahil kami ang nagaayos ng mga proseso. makaraang sinabi ko ito, binansagang na akong 'bastos', 'palasumbat' ni ante sabay binabaan ng tawag. sa tawag din ay kinukumpara niya ako dun sa kakilala namin na marami ng nabiling lupa, sasakyan. take note, almost 25 years na nagtatrabaho iyon compare sa akin na magtatatlong taon pa lang. ang iniisip ko ngayon, ako nga ba talaga itong bastos o palasumbat dahil pinili ko magreason-out regarding sa course ko at maging sa trabaho ko?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/yjcckq/sabi_sa_akin_ng_ante_ko_ay_hindi_ako_tunay_na/,1 11 2022
Sino ang mas kawawa? Magulang o Anak?,"i agree: 1. both biktima ng sistema ng lipunan o ng kultura ng kahirapan 2. both pwedeng magkamali sa desisyon sa buhay 3. both biktima ng pagpapasa ng kultura 4. both merong utak at puso na pwedeng magkamali. i cannot put it into words dahil sobrang personal sa akin neto pero tanong ko lang sa magulang dito o magbabalak mag anak sino ba ang mas kawawa ang magulang or anak? kapag nag desisyon na bumuhay ng bata ang isang couple, automatically magulang na sila, whether they are capable or not, they decided to have a child. pero sa lipunan nating ito, laging talo ang anak. wala namang kamuwang muwang ang bata at higit sa lahat hindi namilit na buhayin sa mundong ito, magulang ang nag desisyon na mag anak pero bakit sila pa din ang kawawa? kawawa sila palagi lalo na sa media portrayal kaya lahat tayo na condition na ganon, laging superior ang magulang sa lahat ng bagay, lagi silang kawawa, lagi silang dapat intindihin, lagi sila dapat bigyan ng pagmamahal, hindi ko maintindihan. nakaka awa lang na hanggang ngayon hindi pa rin mabago yan, example na lang sa mini miss u, may mga bata na naaawa sa magulang nila dahil napapagod magtrabaho, gusto na nilang magtrabaho para makatulong sa magulang nila, hindi ba nakaka gago yun na ipinapakita nila sa anak nila na napapagod sila dahil sa anak nila??? na iniisip ng bata na pabigat sila sa magulang nila??? eh hindi naman ang bata ang nag desisyon na mabuhay siya sa mundong ito kundi ang magulang niya? oo na sige na, sistema na may problema pero maaayos ba agad yan? wala bang mga utak o puso ang mga magulang na ito para maisip nila na desisyon nila mag anak pero pinaparamdam o pinapakita nila sa anak nila na mahirap mabuhay dahil sa anak nila? ang anak laging masama ang edit kapag ka humiwalay, nag decide magpamilya , inuna ang sarili, laging susumbatan ng magulang na pinakain, pinalaki sila neto , pinag aral — eh aba dapat lang kasi responsibilidad mo yun bilang magulang? bakit ganyan yung ibang magulang parang nag anak lang para pagkakitaan o para may mag alaga sa kanila sa pag tanda. hindi ba may buhay din yang mga anak? bakit laging kawawa ang mga magulang??? in the first place naman sila nag decide na bumuhay ng bata, kung nahihirapan sila consequence na yun ng desisyon nila? para sa akin, tama na yang paawa edit, kasalanan mo yan kasi nag anak ka?? hindi ko magets yung edit sa media, na parang utang na loob pa ng bata na nabuhay siya, na parang pinilit niya yung magulang na ipanganak siya?? nag anak lang ba ang mga magulang kasi wala silang pangarap sa buhay? nag anak lang ba sila para may mag alaga sa kanila? nag anak lang ba sila dahil sa pressure ng lipunan? pero isa pa rin yang desisyon? at kung ano mang consequence niyan e own up to it?? hindi yung papaawa ka sa ibang tao, sa tv shows, sa radio shows at maski sa harap ng anak mo para magkaroon ng utang na loob sayo at maawa sayo? hindi ko siya maput into words dahil nga personal kong na experience to e , yung pag mamanipula ng magulang, yung pagpaparamdam sa akin na kasalanan ko kung bakit nahihirapan sila, kasalanan ko kung bakit wala kaming makaen, pisikal at verbal abuse ang naranasan ko masakit man o hindi abuso yun para sa akin , at naranasan ko lahat ito mula bata hanggang sa paglaki, nakwento ko na din to sa mga close friends ko pero para sa kanila normal lang daw yun kaya naisantabi ko yung feelings ko. normal na pala na matawag na palamunin kahit bata ka palang. kaya nung nagkatrabaho ako, sobrang saya ko na makatulong pero nung may nabasa ako somewhere dun ako nagising sa katotohanan na, hindi ko dapat naranasan yun kasi bata lang ako that time. umiiyak ako habang tinatype to, si oa pala to eh haha. tumigil sa pagtatrabaho yung tatay ko nung nagkatrabaho na ako, edi malamang ako na naging breadwinner malamang sa malamang di lang ako nakakaranas neto, kaya nung nagising ako dun na bumalik lahat ng alaala ko nung bata ako, na akala ko normal lang yun pala hindi. hindi dapat. tumutulong ako kasi walang choice, kung hindi ako tutulong walang tutulong sa kanila kasi hindi na bila kaya tulungan sarili nila. o diba kawawa na naman sila. pero kelan magiging kawawa ang mga anak na nagsantabi ng pangarap sa buhay, ng oras, ng pamumuhay magisa, ng pagkakaroon ng karanasan katulad ng mga taong may matitinong magulang, kelannn??? hindi lang ako nakaranas neto dahil sigurado ako marami ding naging forced na maging breadwinner sila pero lagi pa ding kawawa edit ang mga magulang sa media portrayal, maski sa lipunan natin, kelan magkakaroon ng narrative na ""ayan anak pa more, alam mong hindi mo kaya nag anak ka pa, ngayon papa awa kang nahihirapan"" like.... hindi pa ba abuso na bubuo ka ng anak knowing na hindi mo kaya?... sa lipunang ito, sa ekonomiyang ito? nakakasawa na at lubos na nakakalungkot makarinig sa mga bata sa tv na kaya sila sumasali sa contest para makatulong sa magulang. hindi ba nahiya tong mga magulang na pinapakita nila sa mga bata yung paghihirap nila? fcking fake it. maawa ka sa bata, ipinaparamdam mo na mahirap ang buhay dahil sa kanya, at kelangan ka bigyan ng award dahil sa paghihirap mo, eh kung pwede namang hindi ka mahirapan kung hindi ka nag decide mag anak. gets ko na may problema sa sistema, pero maaayos banagad yan? hindi talaga pwede sisihin yung magulang sa desisyon nila? nakakainis yung ibang pa woke sa twitter na sasabihin na problema sa sistema yan kaya ganyan ang mga magulang? like so okay lang mang abuso kasi kasalanan ng sistema, hindi talaga sila pwede sisihin sa katangahang desisyon na ginawa nila???? ewan ko, mapa media, mapa woke. laging kawawa ang magulang , laging kelangan may bigger understanding ang mga anak sa magulang ""hindi mo maiintindihan kasi hindi ka pa nagiging magulang"" like bitch may utak ako and i'm in the right mind not to have a child knowing na im not financially capable para buhayin sila i can only speak for myself, for what i experienced, kung ano nakikita ko sa tv at kung ano response ng kaibigan ko sa karanasan ko, and by all of that, it only means na normal lang to pero hindi talaga dapat siya normal. tl;dr media portrayal affects the thinking of filipinos na nakaka awa ang magulang and it is love to be abusive towards children na forced sila to be a breadwinner and maging caregiver sa magulang dahil sa reponsibilities ng magulang masked as sacrifices. this normalizes the abusive culture at dynamics ng magulang at ng anak. hindi nakaka awa ang mga magulang, desisyon nilang mag anak kaya kung mahirapan man sila dapat di sila mag pa awa. mas nakaka awa ang mga anak na hindi naman nila desisyong mabuhay pero mag susuffer sila sa lipunang ito dahil sa desisyon ng magulang nila. knowing this, sino ang mas nakaka awa? magulang o anak?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/15rkqrq/sino_ang_mas_kawawa_magulang_o_anak/,15 08 2023

Deeply hurt and disappointed,"long rant ahead. sorry, just had to get this off my chest. i've never been invested in politics until this election season. isa ako sa mga walang pake dati. this was until nagannounce si vp na tatakbo siya. di ko alam bakit pero ilang beses ako naiyak while watching her speech. mas naiyak pa ko lalo nung nakita ko yung overwhelming support that poured online that day. nagulat ako kasi i'm aware of how much she's been vilified for the past years. so it was a pleasant surprise to see suddenly almost everyone i know expressing support. tapos nagtuloy tuloy na. dumami ng dumami yung mga tumitindig. padami ng padami yung mga sumasali sa rallies. yung mga kilala kong apolitical din started to make a stand. sobrang saya ko nun kasi akala ko finally, natauhan na tayo lahat. ayaw na natin sa nakasanayan natin na hirap, gusto na natin ng tunay na pagbabago. i trust the science of the surveys pero naniniwala ako na may milagro pa na pwede mangyari to make vp win. after all, ngayon lang natin nakita ung ganitong level of engagement from the common filipino. kumilos ang mga tao on a scale na hindi pa natin nakita before. nagsipag din naman ang team nila vp. ginawa nila lahat ng pwede. so for me, napakaunfair ng mundo naman if at the end of it all, all the hard work, passion and dedication, those efforts won't be rewarded, especially if it's for the good of everyone. pero sadly, that's not how the world works. ang sakit. nakakatakot. nakakabahala. it's very selfish to say but i feel i've been betrayed by my fellow countrymen. ako at lahat ng tumindig para sa bansa at para din naman sa kanila. basta masakit hahaha anyway, as vp (but to me, the president) said during her mda speech, ""ang minsan nang namulat, hinding-hindi na ulit mapipikit "", this election has changed me forever. and for that, i'm very grateful. i'm sure i'm not the only one. sana lahat tayo handa pa rin ipaglaban ang mga dapat ipaglaban sa mga susunod na taon.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ulsk0e/deeply_hurt_and_disappointed/,9 05 2022
Kwentong Covid ni Lanie Magdurulan,"“ako po si lani magdurulan. may apat akong anak. dalawa na lang ang natira. masakit sa akin iyon, lalo na ngayong pandemic, wala na yung isa kong anak na babae. noong october 4, dinala ko siya sa ospital pero nag-aagaw-buhay na siya. ayaw siyang tanggapin sa ospital kasi raw may covid. matagal kami sa labas ng ospital. kasama niya yung asawa niya noon. ayaw siyang tanggapin. eh, wala naming covid yung anak ko kasi nga, nabinat ata yon o lumaki yung puso. pero wala yong covid. . . nagtitinda ako ng biscuits dito sa cavite, kasi gusto kong malibang. kasi pag nandito ako sa bahay, lagi na lang akong umiiyak. gusto kong malibang yung sarili ko. kahit nga umuulan, naglalakad ako, nagpapayong ako, nagdedeliver ako. andami ngang naaawa sakin, sabi nila, “wag na po kayong lumabas, kami na po ang pupunta sa bahay niyo, kasi kawawa naman kayo. nababasa na nga kayo ng ulan, puro putik pa.” sagot ko naman sa kanila, “masaya naman ako sa ginagawa ko. kasi nga, dito ako lumiligaya na naglalakad, nalilibang ko ang sarili ko kaysa naman andito ako sa bahay, umiiyak ako. lagi akong umiiyak, luhaan, kasi maiisip ko yung nawala kong anak. dalawang buwan pa lang siyang nawawala. . . ang mga anak ko ang kinikuhanan ko ng lakas ng loob. laging anak. yun ang pampatibay saking loob na maging strong ako. pati mga apo. gusto ko pang mabuhay nang dahil sa kanila. ang sabi ko nga, “sama-sama na lang tayo kasi konti na lang kami. ang gusto ko sa nalalabing araw ng buhay ko, sama-sama na lang kami.” ayaw ko ng hiwa-hiwalay dahil ang lungkot ng buhay. malungkot mag-isa. masakit. wala ka man lang makaramay, matanungan, o masabihan pag may problema ka. wala. kaya pinapauwi ko na siya para sama-sama na kami, kaya nakiusap ako sa manager na lipat nalang siya sa manila para mas malapit. para sama-sama kami. . . mahirap ang buhay. mahirap kumilos kasi mahirap lumabas dahil sa covid. mahirap magtrabaho. mahirap maghanapbuhay. kaya sa lahat, sumunod sa patakaran ng gobyerno. magsuot ng mask para iwas sa covid. at unang una rin, magpray lagi kay god. lahat ng tao ay may pag-asa talaga. pero sa gaya naming mahihirap, kailangang magsumikap para mabuhay sa mundo para may pambili ng pangangailangan, lalong lalo na ng pagkain. lumaban lang tayo sa buhay.” ""ikaw, ano'ng kwentong covid mo?"" #kwentongcovid",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/jti3kx/kwentong_covid_ni_lanie_magdurulan/,13 11 2020

Valentines Break Up,"yung iba siguro excited mag valentines, lalo na mga may jowa. samantalang ako, i'm waiting for valentines for the official break up of me and my boyfriend. sa totoo lang ang tagal ko na nakikipagbreak sa boyfriend ko kaso hindi siya pumapayag. this time, ayoko na talaga, ang dami ko na nasasabi na masakit na salita, nagrequest lang siya na paabutin ko man lang sa birthday nya which is february 13. syempre alam ko curious kayo bakit? ano bang nangyari? actually, kaya rin ako nagpopost dito para humingi ng opinion. bago pa kami magkakilala ng boyfriend ko, kilala na siya sa pagiging loko-loko, lalo na sa pagweweed. literal na bad boy na aayawan ng typical na magulang (pero hindi naman mukhang adik, he's good looking lol). so ayon cut ko na lang yung kadramahan sa first few months ng relationship namin. nagbago naman siya, or that's what i thought. lagi kami nag-aaway dahil may nababasa ako sa messenger nya about marijuana, keso sa kumukuha si ganyan sa kanya, nagtatanong ganto. umamin na rin siya sakin na he smoked weed twice while we are in a relationship. una pa lang naman sinabi ko sa kanya na malaman ko lang isang beses na bumalik siya sa pag gaganon, hihiwalayan ko siya. pero ayon marupok si ate mo girl, umabot pa ng pangalawa or baka lima hindi lang nya sinasabi. bukod sa marijuana, pinag-aawayan talaga namin pagiging sinungaling nya, as in huli mo na nga, may ebidensya na, itatanggi pa at iibahin ang istorya. tangina naman ganyan ba kayong mga lalaki lols. last year, december hindi na rin kami okay dahil nanaman sa mga nababasa ko sa messenger nya, alam nyo yung nawalan na ako ng tiwala sa kanya to the point na wala na akong amor sa kanya. sabi ko nga sa kanya plano ko bago sana mag 2021, magbreak na kami kasi tangina paulit-ulit na lang hanggang sa ayan ayaw nya iyak iyak magbabago nanaman. lumipas ilang bwan okay nanaman kami, hanggang sa netong feb, may nabasa nanaman ako na nagtatanong siya kung may available na weed. may nagpapatanong lang daw sa kanya na kaibigan. ang pangit pa kasi dun, nagdedelete siya tapos chinat nya ung kausap nya na magchat ulit sila ganyan, para bang gumawa sila ng bagong convo ulit para mapakita na nagtatanong siya para sa kaibigan nya. eh alam ko na iba na un kasi di naman yun yung nabasa ko nung una. nakakagigil diba ginagawa pa akong tanga. pinipilit nya na ano ba masama sa marijuana, importante raw hindi na siya gumagamit, tinutulungan nya lang mga kaibigan nya pag naghahanap. sige may point siguro na tangina herbal yan, natural pero ang sakin naman kasi, illegal yon! pwede siya mapahamak at ako, kung hindi nya kaya i-adjust yon at tuluyan alisin sa buhay nya, edi sana humanap siya ng iba na kaya mag-adjust para sa kanya kasi di ko naman pinagsisiksikan sarili ko sa kanya. are my reasons petty? or i should have broke up with him the first time he broke my trust? yun lang di ko sure kung may magbabasa neto pero post ko na lang din kasi wala naman ako napag-oopenan ng tungkol sa relationship ko.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/lavdeu/valentines_break_up/,2 02 2021

Anybody who had anal fissure/hemorrhoids?,"i have anal fissure for over a year now. una medyo nakakatakot lang kasi nagulat nalang ako na may dugo sa dumi ko, but it was painless. so it just kept happening, theres a bit of blood outside especially over the tail end of the poop but since it was painless hinayaan ko nalang. (napapa kris aquino ako kasi nanlalambot ako pag naiisip ko to hihi). pero isang beses nung nagtubol talaga ako grabe ang sakit, simula noon lahat na ng pagtae ko ang hirap, talagang pagpapawisan at paghahandaan mo ang pagpunta sa cr para makapagipon ng lakas kasi sobrang sakit talaga. the pain would never end there because after i pooped i can never sit straight for hours because of how sore my a-hole was. the only thing i could to relax do was lie down straight. after weeks or months there were periods na nagheal and i think it was back to normal relax pooping and i was relieved, but dumating nanaman ung significant na tubol tapos nag recur nanaman yung blood, and i knew from myself that tomorrow is going to be the start of pain. indeed it was. i have not visited any doctor yet, but the first time i saw blood i didnt tell my parents first pero nung naging concerning na sa akin sinabi ko na, kahit alam kong grabe takot nila. i only searched google for everything about my situation. di ko nga sure kung fissure or hemorrhoids eh. (shocked tlaga sila, kasi may history ng colon cancer line ni papa, si lola namatay due to that) so yon, aside from the pain, there is also the problem of rectal discharge na para bang sinisipon yung pwet (lalo na kapag masakit after pooping magdidischarge talaga. so its been weeks now since i have last encountered blood on my poop. nitong mga recent aftermath ng handaan, wala ring blood (yay) but the pain doesnt end yet. for some reason if i soap my anal area, it stings. i dont know why because i cant see down there pero internal ang fissure dba? so sinearch ko, tumungkol naman sa hemorrhoid wag daw sabunin kasi ma iirritate. ibig sabihin hemorrhoid naman problema ko ngayon, or did i really had both all along? this really changed the game of going to the toilet for me. i can never experience the ""comfort"" in comfort room ever again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/krb2hz/anybody_who_had_anal_fissurehemorrhoids/,5 01 2021

""tama ka. nagta-trabaho ka sa isang outsourcing security company at sa alam ko, malaki sila mag-bayad. malay mo, mas maging mataas pa ang posisyon mo sa hinaharap."" - sabay kindat. ""ok. ano naman ang mga trabaho ko dito..."" pagsisimula ko. ""ahh, 'yun. wala naman gaano, siguraduhin mo lang na walang makakapasok."" - lumapit s'ya sa akin at sinabing - ""o labas."" isang maikling katahimikan at nagtinginan kaming dalawa, doon ay napa-ngiti ito at ang sabi: ""de, joke lang. so ayun, tapos na 'yung shift ko, kaya naman mauuna na ako. basta doon ka lang sa office at mag-relax hanggang alas sais ng umaga. doon darating na 'yung kahalili mo."" at doon nga ay umalis na s'ya. umupo ako sa upuan sa may office. akala ko siguro naman walang hindi magandang mangyayari. may papel sa harap ko at habang tinitignan ko ito ay doon ko lang napagtanto na ito ay listahan ng mga rules na specifically naka-asign sa akin. ito ang sabi: sa bagong gwardiya. welcome to the company. sa baba ay ang listahan ng mga rules para sa iyong trabaho: 1. ang una mong dapat gawin ay ang mag-conduct ng full sweep sa buong area para siguraduhin na walang kakaibang mga nangyayari liban sa ordinary (pati sa crypt). important note: kung may katawan man na naka-labas sa chambers sa loob ng crypt, itulak mo lamang ito pabalik. dapat manatili silang nasa-loob sa lahat ng pagkakataon. 2. matapos ang buong sweep, maari ka nang manatili sa loob ng office hanggang matapos ang shift mo. may iba pang mga rules na naka-lista sa baba, pero nag-desisyon akong libutin muna ang buong lugar. medyo may kaliitan ang morge, may isang malaking medical room na halos mapuno ng medical supplies ang loob. pero may sapat na espasyo para sa 2-3 lamesa na puwedeng pag-lagyan ng mga labi. sa loob ng crypt ay may palikuran. nag-desisyon akong unahin na ang pinaka-ayaw kong lugar - 'yung crypt. umalis na ako sa office at binuksan ang solid at napaka-bigat na pinto ng crypt, agad-agad ay sinalubong ako ng napaka-lamig na hangin. sa loob, may dalawang katawan sa gitna ng kwarto at mga chambers sa pader. lahat naman sila ay sarado kaya naman mabilis akong lumabas ng kwarto. habang pabalik ako mula sa bathroom, may nakita akong lalaki na naka lab coat na naka-tayo sa gitna ng medical room. parang may kinakalikot gamit ang mga medical tools malapit sa isang body bag. ""tang... tinakot mo naman ako boss."" - sabi ko. tinignan n'ya ako na parang wala lang at bumalik sa ginagawa nito. ""akala ko umuwi na ang lahat. ako nga pala si michael, bagong gwardiya."" - sabi ko, gaya ng nauna, hindi n'ya ako pinansin. kumaway na ako at umalis pabalik ng office. babasahin ko na sana ulit ang mga rules ng biglang may matinis na tunog akong narinig na para bang may bakal na kumi-kiskis sa isa pang bakal na nag-eecho sa buong building. medyo mahina na ito at parang nang-gagaling sa mga tubo. tumagal din iyon ng ilang segundo at huminto sa kaparehas na segundo. hindi ko na lang pinansin at i-idlip na lang, check ng cell phone. pero medyo tumatagal na ang tunog at habang mas kinikilabutan ako ay unti-unti nang nagbabago ang kanina'y parang bakal na kumi-kiskis sa isa't-isa ay naging... ungol. lumabas ako ng office at tatanungin ko sana 'yung kaninang naka lab coat pero mukhang naka-uwi na s'ya sa mga oras na 'yun. hindi ako sigurado kung saan mismo nang-gagaling ang tunog, pero parang sa may crypt, kaya naman pinuntahan ko ito. 'yung oras na binuksan ko ang pinto ay ang buong building ay nanahimik. huminga ako ng malalim at napansin ko na 'yung isang chambers ay naka-bukas na ng bahagya. tinulak ko ito pabalik at agad-agad na bumalik sa office. nawala na ng tuluyan ang matinis na na para bang ungol na iyon. nagpatuloy ako sa pagbabasa: 3. maari kang matulog sa office, pero dapat handa ka sa mga mangyayari. sleep at your own risk, ika nga nila. matapos nun ay isang napaka-lakas na tunog ang halos mag-patalon sa buong pagkatao ko. ""tulong! palabasin n'yo ako dito!"" - ang boses ay tila nang-gagaling sa mga tubo. tumayo ako habang sobra ang kalabog ng dibdib ko. ""palabasin n'yo ako, hindi ako maka-hinga!"" - paulit-ulit na pagmama-kaawa ng boses na ngayon ay may kasama ng kalabog. binuksan ko ang pintuan ng office at sa hindi malaman na dahilan sa crypt nang-gagaling ang boses. nanginginig, pero binuksan ko ang pinto. ""buhay pa ako, isa itong pagkakamali! tulong!"" - mas lalong lumakas ang boses nung oras na buksan ko ang napaka-bigat at solidong pinto. ""asan ka?!"" - nanginginig akong tumingin sa paligid, habang ang walang humpay na tumatawag ang boses na may kasamang malalakas na kalabog. lumapit ako at unti-unting inilapit ang tenga para maka-siguro na ang bubuksan ko ay ang tamang chamber. ""buhay pa ako! utang na loob! ple----"" ang boses at ang mga kalabog ay daglian na lamang nawala nang biglaan kong binuksan ang isa sa mga chambers at sinalubong ako ng malamig na bangkay ng isang middle-aged na lalaki. tumayo lang ako doon, nakatitig sa bangkay, halos tumigil sa pagtakbo ang isip ko sa kung ano ang mga nangyayari. malinaw na malinaw kong narinig at naramdaman ko ang bawat kalabog nung oras na hinawakan ko ang hawakan ng chamber at para bang may kung sino man na bigla-bigla na lang nagpatigil nito. pinaglalaruan lang ba ako ng aking isipan? tinulak ko ang chamber pabalik at mabilis na umalis doon, nilock ang pinto ng office. iniisip ko na ang pag-aaply sa trabahong 'to ay maaring isang malaking pagkakamali. pakiramdam ko na nababaliw na ako, pero agad ko ring kinumbinse ang sarili ko na nasa ulo ko lang lahat ng 'to. nagpatuloy ako sa pagbabasa ng mg rules: 4. puwede kang mag-patugtog para maibsan ang katahimikan basta't hindi ito makaka-kuha ng atensyon sa labas. 5. kung may marinig kang hindi mo maipaliwanag na ingay galing sa may crypt, 'wag mo na lamang ito pansinin. 6. kung ang mga ingay na 'yun ay naging sigaw ng pagpapanic, gawin ang mga sumusunod: • kung ang mga sigaw ay mula sa babae, 'wag mo pansinin hanggang sa tumigil ito. 'wag na 'wag kang papasok sa loob ng crypt sa mga oras na nangyayari ito sa kahit anong dahilan. • kung ang mga ingay ay mula sa lalaki, hanapin ang pinag-mumulan ng ingay at hatakin ang chamber. dapat huminto na ang ingay pagkatapos mong mabuksan ang chamber. doon na nagtatapos ang page. nilapag ko na ang papel at dahan-dahang inilapat ang likod ko sa upuan. ala una na noon at nag-sisimula na akong antukin. maya-maya pa ay nagsisimula ng pumikit ang aking mga mata ng kusa. nagsisimula na akong mahulog sa panaginip nang biglang may mahigpit akong hawak na naramdaman sa likod ng aking balikat. sa sobrang gulat ko ay agad-agad akong napatayo at sinipa ang upuan. walang tao o kahit ano noong mga oras na iyon. hindi na ako inaantok nung mga oras na 'yun. tahimik na ang buong kapaligiran noon at nagpunta ako sa palikuran. pagbalik ko ay alas tres na at halos handa na akong tapusin ang shift ko dito. napagisip-isip ko na hindi na rin masama para sa isang libo, hanggang tinalikod ko ang papel na may mga rules at napansin kong may naka-sulat pa sa likod: 7. lahat ng staff ay lalabas o dapat nasa labas na ng building bago mag alas diyes ng gabi, kaya kung may makita kang lalaki na naka lab coat during your shift, 'wag na 'wag sa kahit ano mang sitwasyon na subukan mong makipag-usap sa kanya. paulit-ulit-ulit kong binasa ang rule ng limang beses, pero wala pa ring nagbabago sa naka-sulat. may mahinang katok sa pinto ng office. tinignan ko ito at sa likod ng salamin ay nakita ko ang lalaking naka lab coat naka-ngiti sa akin. alas kwatro 'y media na at patuloy pa rin s'ya sa pagkatok. sa mga magta-tanong, hindi ko na ho alam kung saan ko ito nakuha dahil 2018 ko pa po ito tinagalog. nakita ko lang na naka-save pa rin sa note ng selpon ko. salamat and ang init. tangina.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/t8j464/tagalized_morgue/,7 03 2022
A hard pill to swallow pero need talaga ma-phaseout ang Jeepney for our country to move forward,"bago ako kuyugin ng mga tao dito at sabihang “elitista”, “anti-poor”, o “dutertards/alamano”, uunahan ko na kayo at sasabihin isa lang din akong kapwa mananakay at average worker, walang kotse o motor. with that in mind, can we please hear out the other side of this issue without turning it down? without dismissing it just because “kawawa” naman yung mga jeepnery drivers etc.? tayo ba at kapwa mananakay hindi kawawa, sila lang? don’t we deserve better? puro awa na lang ba? the romanticization of the jeepney phaseout issue is becoming worst day by day. hindi naman sya surprise, yet people are only resisting just now, bakit hindi kayo nagprotesta nung bill pa lang sya? anong nangyari sa loob ng 10+ years na pagsulong ng proyekto na ito, bakit walang ginawang counterproposal itong mga operators at jeepney drivers sa mga taong yun? bakit hindi sila nag-effort? now for better understanding and for those who claims na “agad-agad” daw yung project, well it’s not. it’s actually over a decade of urong-sulong because of the woke resistance: **january 4, 2016** – piston protested at the head office of the then-dotc. it wanted to make sure that the ltfrb and lto would accept the applications for registration of old jeepneys. former ltfrb chairperson winston ginez said a mandatory phaseout would begin in 2017. **(this was one of the earliest reports of cnn philippines about the matter. in 2012, the noynoy aquino administration pushed to introduce e-jeepneys. then-dotc secretary mar roxas said the age limits of puvs over time would be reduced. media reports said the phaseout plan has been issued by the dotc since 2002 but it was not seriously implemented.)** **september 21, 2016** – jeepney operators and drivers warned that they plan to hold a nationwide transport holiday if congress passed a bill that would approve the newly named department of transportation’s (dotr) plan to carry out the puv phaseout program, among other projects. the bill also pushed to give emergency powers to former president rodrigo duterte to solve the transport crisis. **february 6, 2017** – the stop and go coalition called for a nationwide transport strike, the first of many. it affected thousands of passengers and forced the cities of manila and malabon to suspend work and classes. it ended after the ltfrb called for a dialogue. the transport groups were reportedly unsatisfied with its results. **february 27, 2017** – the leaders of transport groups piston, stop and go coalition, and no to jeepney phase out coalition (njpoc) staged another nationwide strike, as a response to the government’s inaction to their appeal to amend the modernization program. some local government units in luzon and the visayas suspended classes, with malacañang also announcing a class suspension for metro manila on the eve of the strike. **june 19, 2017** – the ltfrb announced that the puv modernization program would start after a month under its order called omnibus franchising guidelines. aside from the phaseout, the program would stop giving franchises to single-unit operators. it was also reported that the government-affiliated land bank of the philippines had put up a ₱1-billion credit facility to cover the replacement of some 650 jeepneys, which would cost from around ₱1.4 million to ₱1.6 million per unit. days later, the department of trade and industry released possible designs for a prototype of the modern jeepney. after a few months, transport officials said that by 2020, all puvs would be modernized. **october 16-17, 2017** – jeepney drivers and operators led by piston staged another nationwide strike. the ltfrb claimed it received reports that it was part of a destabilization plot but the group denied the allegation. the ltfrb warned that it would cancel the franchises of operators who participated in the strike. traffic enforcers took photos of drivers who joined the protest, it added. during an event in camarines sur, duterte had some harsh words for members of piston and other protesters, warning them about serious consequences if they didn’t join the program. **december 5, 2017** – george san mateo, piston’s national president at that time, posted bail after he was arrested on dec. 1 for violating the commonwealth act no. 146, or the public service law. the case stemmed from the february piston-led strike. **december 11, 2017** – the senate committee on public service, led by sen. grace poe, conducted a hearing on the puv modernization program. poe said the ₱80,000 subsidy would not be enough to assist jeepney drivers as modern jeepneys cost ₱1.6 million each. but according to her own computation, each unit would actually cost ₱2.1 million at a 6% interest rate per annum if the payment period was seven years. groups led by piston planned to stage a week-long transport strike but called it off because of the hearing. they mounted transport caravans instead. **january 2, 2018** – the dotr said old jeepneys must meet government requirements as determined by a motor vehicle inspection system (mvis), or a roadworthiness test, before they could resume plying their routes until 2020. the agency also said jeepney units must be replaced with euro-4 compliant engines. **january 8, 2018** – transport officials started its tanggal bulok, tanggal usok campaign, where they issued warnings to smoke-belching vehicles and temporary operator’s permits for vehicles with defective parts and accessories. a month later, they cracked down on jeepneys at the university of the philippines diliman and issued citations to 95 drivers. the surprise operation affected students, teachers and employees. the dotr deployed only 10 solar-powered jeepneys to the campus. **march 19, 2018** – the ltfrb released a memorandum circular telling individual operators to join a cooperative or corporation that would operate more than 15 units, or group themselves to form a single juridical entity, by march 2019. this started the industry consolidation component of the puv modernization program. **october 8, 2018** – in a senate hearing, the ltfrb said it will postpone the implementation of the total puv phaseout originally set for march 2019, following opposition from senators and transport groups. but days later, then-transportation secretary arturo tugade said they would continue with the modernization program. **july 15, 2019** – alliance of concerned transport organizations (acto) and piston staged a protest, warning of another nationwide strike if their calls were ignored. efren de luna, acto’s president at that time, said in an earlier forum that they were not against the program but the phaseout had to be gradual. **september 30, 2019** – ltfrb’s then-chief martin delgra said around 18,000 puv units nationwide, including 5,642 jeepneys, had complied with the modernization program. the government is looking to modernize around 170,000 units. he also said the transition phase of the program would end by june 2020. transport groups claimed a successful nationwide strike on the same day. acto’s de luna said nine out of 10 jeepneys in major cities participated in the protest action. delgra reportedly vowed they would proceed with the program. **march 2020** – the enhanced community quarantine (ecq) or a total lockdown was implemented in luzon because of the covid-19 pandemic, crippling the transport sector. **june 2020** – transport group federation of jeepney operators and drivers association of the philippines (fejodap) expressed concern the government would use the covid-19 pandemic as an excuse to phase out jeepneys, after modern jeepneys were prioritized over traditional jeepneys and uv express units to resume operations. in july, provisional authorities of puv operators were extended until dec. 31, 2020. **december 18, 2020** – the ltfrb extended the franchise consolidation deadline to march 31, 2021. **march 29, 2021** – the ltfrb extended the franchise consolidation deadline until the lifting of the ecq. in april, the board gave provisional authority to drivers and operators valid for a year. in december, it opened the application for operators plying routes that have yet to consolidate until march 2022. **march 25, 2022** – in a memorandum circular, the ltfrb said the provisional authorities for traditional jeepneys will be valid until march 2023, to give them time for franchise validation. in september, the board also extended the deadline for operators plying routes that have yet to consolidate. **february 21, 2023** – the ltfrb extended the deadline for the franchise consolidation until june 30, as ltfrb chief teofilo guadiz iii revealed only about 60% of traditional jeepneys had been modernized. **february 27, 2023** – manibela chairperson mar valbuena said around 100,000 drivers and operators would stage a week-long, nationwide strike on march 6 to pressure the ltfrb into suspending the mandatory consolidation. he reiterated calls that the program must be humane and reasonable, and for the vehicles to be locally made. **march 1, 2023** – president ferdinand marcos jr. urged drivers to cancel the strike but he stressed the need to implement the modernization program in a “different way.” it was the first time he shared his sentiments on the matter after winning the elections. during his campaign, marcos said the dotr should modernize puvs by inspecting the vehicles’ condition and not simply basing it on age. in the afternoon, the ltfrb announced the extension of the franchise consolidation deadline, now set until dec. 31, to give the transport sector “more time to consolidate.” but manibela’s valbuena said the strike would still push through. **march 2, 2023** – in a hearing, senators urged transport regulators to indefinitely postpone the deadline of the franchise consolidation. sen. poe noted that the national government itself is not yet ready to implement the puv modernization program. **march 6, 2023** – in anticipation of the possible effects of the transport strike, various cities and schools, mostly in metro manila, announced the shift to online and asynchronous classes. libreng sakay trips were also prepared. however, malacañang said many of the country's transport groups were not participating. **december 31, 2023** – this is the last day for drivers and operators to consolidate. **2024** – the second component of the puv modernization program will start. so sinong nagkulang? hindi totoong lahat ay pabor sa modernization, kagaya nung sinasabi nila. maraming jeepney drivers at operators ang ayaw talaga nito dahil hindi na nila magagawa yung mga kabalastugan na ginagawa nila noon. marami sa kanila ang may “pwede na yan, tumatakbo pa naman” mindset at ayaw mamuhunan dahil “nakasanayan” na. marami ding pasahero ayaw ng pagbabago dahil ayaw din nila gumastos o dahil kesyo kultura daw. adapt or die. we are in a capitalistic society whether we like or not, and jeepney like everything else is a transport business, “not a charity”. hindi kasalanan ng iba na humingi ng convenience, same way na hindi kasalanan ng mga tao kung bakit itong mga jeepney drivers na ito ay mawawalan ng trabaho kung sakaling matuloy man ang phase out. nilulugar dapat ang empathy at rules and regulation. hindi maaaring puro, pwede na lang. sa daan patunong progresong lipunan, masakit mang tanggapin, pero meron talagng collateral at masasagasaan. that’s how it is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/11komzv/a_hard_pill_to_swallow_pero_need_talaga/,7 03 2023
Tagalized Story.,"may story ako. ako lang ang nag-iisang babae sa pinag-tatrabahuhan kong kumpanya at alam ko na kung bakit. isa akong fresh graduate sa kolehiyo at gusto ko na talagang makapag-simula ng career agad-agad na walang kinalaman sa pagse-serve ng pagkain, pagpupunas ng mga gamit, o pag-dadala o timpla ng kape sa isang matandang negosyante. sa naka-sanayan nag-aapply ako sa trabaho na may anim na araw na trabaho at marami-rami na rin akong interview na napagdaanan. alam ko na ang tinapos kong hrm na kurso ay hindi gaanong makaka-kuha ng magandang oportunidad, pero naniniwala pa rin ako na may mas maganda pang trabaho na naghihintay sa akin. kaya naman nanatili akong positibo, matyaga, at nag-aapply lang sa mga office jobs na may magandang benipisyo. kahit halos wala na akong mapag-kunan ng makakain dahil sa magastos na mga interview, at least mapapag-tibay naman nito ang kakaunting pride na natitira sa akin. halos tatlong linggo na rin ang nakalipas, may isa akong phone interview sa isang internet security company. ang kumpanyang iyon ay maraming offices sa amin at naghahanap sila ng bagong customer support specialist para sa kanilang international department. ang mga requirements ay maganda o mahinahon na boses, good spoken and written grammar, kakaunting tech-knowledge, at may kakayahang mag-trabaho sa umaga at gabi. ang office ay dalawang sakay lang sa mula sa amin, at mayroon silang magandang offer sa health insurance. nag-aapply ako kahit lmitado lang din ang alam ko sa computer science. naging maayos naman ang phone interview at matapos ang dalawang meetings sa hr at sa management, binigyan nila ako ng isang napaka-gandang offer (kahit na wala pa talaga akong experience sa kahit anong trabaho). sa loob ng unang linggo ko, kailangan kong magtrabaho nang regular shift na 9-5 (am) para maging online ako kasabay ng manager ko, na nag-trabaho sa ibang branch ng kumpanya. pagkatapos noon ay kailangan kong magtrabaho para sa regular na schedule ko bilang support - ang schedule ko ay 6 na araw na pasok (09:00 am -05:00 pm (am) at may isang araw na night shift 09:00 pm - 05:00 am respectively). sa unang araw ko, ang suot ko ay isang loose na sweater at mahabang skirt. bilang sa kaalaman ko ay sa ganitong uri ng trabaho ay karamihan mga lalaki ang empleyado, ayaw ko naman mag-cause ng unnecessary attention dahil sa provocatively o inappropriately pag-susuot ng hindi naayon na attire. ang lalaki sa front desk ay mukha namang maayos na tao. pinakilala n'ya ang sarili n'ya bilang si andrew bago n'ya ako tulungang mag-fill out ng mga paperwork at sinamahan n'ya na ako sa aking mesa at sa isang open space na workspace. nakatitig lang ako sa tila walang katapusang mga desks habang naglalakad kami, napansin ko na halos hindi mo makikita ang mga mukha ng bawat taong nagta-trabaho na naka-upo sa bawat desks. wala man lang akong nakita o napansin na babae habang nag-lalakad kami sa tila baga'y walang katapusang workspace na iyon, na talaga namang hindi normal at nakaka-bahala. kahit ang kalmadong presensya ni andrew ay hindi kayang maiwaglit ang wari kakaibang pakiramdam na naka-tuon sa akin. halos maubusan ako ng hininga ng maramdaman ko ang mga presensya ng bagong kong co-workers na tila nagsasabi na ""hindi ka nababagay dito"". nagulat ako ng biglang huminto si andrew sa isang desk na napuno ng mga printed memes, floral stickers, at isang lumang keychain na naka-patong sa harap ng monitor. bukod pa doon ay natatakpan na rin ng makapal na alikabok ang keyboard, monitor at ang natitirang ispasyo ng desk. ""ahhh... anong nangyari..."" sabi ni andrew sa medyo upset na boses. ""pasensya ka na."" sabi nito habang nakatingin sa aking mga papeles. ""ah... aya. dapat matagal na 'tong nalinis. kailangan kong maka-usap ang custodian"". ""ok lang 'yun"", sagot ko. ""puwede ko namang punasan na lang 'yan, wala namang problema"". medyo asiwa na noon si andrew, pero habang ginagala ko ang aking paningin ay malinaw na wala ng ibang bakanteng desk maliban doon. mabilis na natapos ang araw na iyon. natutunan ko na ang mga dapat kung gawin na sumagot sa support related phone calls at gumawa ng bagong ticket para sa system. kailangan ko ring i-monitor ang lahat ng pumapasok na chats at written tickets at isaayos ito base sa level ng urgency at type nito. hindi naman ako required mag-bigay ng technical advice, pero dapat maging pamilyar ako sa aming product software. bilang wala pa namang mga tawag ay pinaki-alaman ko muna ang manual. halos wala akong maintindihan sa mga naroon kaya naman ginogle ko na lang ang karamihan na nasa manual. kinumusta ako noon ng manager ko at mukhang hindi s'ya masaya sa mga lapses ko sa mga materials. dahil pakiramdam ko wala akong matinong nagawa at gagawin sa mga oras na iyon ay panandalian akong nag-break para linisin ang mesa ko. tumayo ako para tanungin si andrew kung saan makaka-kuha ng basahan para sa mesa ko. agad-agad kong pinagsisihan ang desisyon kong iyon. ang bawat mata sa kwarto ay tila napako sa pagtayo ko sa aking kinauupuan. hindi ako sigurado pero maraming mga bulungan akong narinig habang papalayo ako sa aking mesa. ang kaninang maingay na mga keyboard ay pahina nang pahina na halos kainin na ako ng lupa sa sobrang hindi ko pagiging kumportable at self-conscious na rin at the same time. napansin ko na lang na halos halikan ko na ang dibdib ko sa pagyuko para lang hindi ako mapansin. bago ako maka-rating sa isang palikong daan patungo sa front desk ay buong-lakas kong tinignan ang isang tila walang hiyang lalaki na nakatitig sa akin. hindi ko alam kung ano ang inaasahan ko, pero 'yung overall appearance ng lalaking naka-hooding pang-asar na 'yun ay nagbigay ng matinding kilabot sa buong katawan ko. siguro mga ka-edad ko s'ya pero hindi man lang s'ya nahiya o natinag sa pagkaka-titig n'ya sa akin sa kabila ng pagtitig ko sa kanya na may halong pagka-bwisit at inis. isang kakila-kilabot na ngiti ang sumilaw sa mga labi nito habang naka-titig sa parteng bukong-bukong ng aking mga paa at dahan-dahan itong bumalik sa kanyang monitor. inisip ko kung anong magiging reaksyon n'ya kapag tinitigan ko rin ng kaparehong paraan ng pagtitig n'ya sa akin ang tinitigyawat n'yang leeg. parehong reaksyon pa rin ang nakuha ko habang naglalakad ako pabalik sa aking mesa kasama ang box ng computer wipes sa mga kamay ko. may maganda ring nangyari sa araw na iyon. habang nililinis ko ang mga drawer ng mesa ko ay may nakita akong half-used notebook mula sa nakaraang nagta-trabaho sa mesa ko. hindi n'ya nilagay ang first name n'ya, kundi initial lang at last name: j. espiritu. pero, base sa dekorasyon ng notebook, sigurado ako na babae rin s'ya kagaya ko. ang mga naiwan n'yang gamit ay nagbigay ng kapanatagan sa akin, pero 'yung notebook ang talagang pumukaw ng atensyon ko. doon ay sinabi nito ang pina-ikli at simpleng manual gamit ang easy-to-undertand terms at mga explenasyon sa nakaka-litong terminolohiya at komplikadong panuto sa manual. sa tulong n'ya ay nasurpresa ko ang aking manager sa aking product knowledge pagkatapos ng shift ko. matapos ang isang magandang araw ay buong tapang akong gumala sa office at nag-explore sa pantry. binenta ni andrew sa akin ang top-notch coffee machine at snacks sa nasabing pantry, tutal nagugutom na rin naman ako matapos ang isang emotionally, intellectually and productive na araw na 'yun. (ansabe). tsaka, medyo butas na rin 'yung bulsa at namumula na ang mga credit cards ko, kaya naman ayos na ako sa ilang pirasong masasarap na cookies. habang papalapit ako ay may narinig akong malakas na usapan at tawanan sa pantry. sa katangahan ko ay inisip ko na baka naman mas mainit, friendly o kahit maka-tao na sila sa akin. subalit ang maliit na pantry ay napuno ng katahimikan the moment na pumasok ako sa pantry. may limang lalaki doon na mag-kakaiba ang edad at lalaki na naka-upo sa palibot ng isang maliit na lamesa, at lahat sila ay naka-titig na direkta sa akin. ""panget na araw?"" - tugon ng isang pang-asar na boses. agad kong itinaas ang ulo ko mula sa pagkaka-titig sa sahig para hanapin ang pinag-mulan ng boses. hindi naging mahirap sa aking hanapin at malaman na mula iyon sa naka-hoodie na walang-hiyang tumitig sa akin nung nakaraan lang. ""siguro marami ka ng experience?"" - sambit pa nito sa nakaka-asar na tono at may-unting pag-taas ng kilay. ""para makakuha ng komportableng trabaho. siguro sikat ka?"". ""ano 'to, high-school?"" - sagot ko sa malakas na boses. hindi ko hilig kumompronta ng tao, pero sobra na 'to. hostility is one thing, social awkwardness is another, pero pakiramdam ko isa 'tong 80's na high-school drama na mga trenta anyos ang mga bida bilang mga teenagers. ""nandito lang ako para kumuha kape at kung may problema ka sa trabaho ko, puwede mong dalhin sa hr kung ano man ang issue mo"". nagpatuloy ako habang ine-enjoy ang namumutla at pahiyang mukha ng mga taong 'yun. mabuti naman, gusto kong maramdaman nila ang katiting na discomfort na buong araw kung kinakaharap. pinili kong lumayo sa aking mga co-workers, naglakad ako ng taas noo pabalik sa mesa ko na may hawak-hawak na tasa ng kape. bago pa ako maka-upo at enjoyin ang masarap na kape, napansin kong may isang mensahe galing sa hindi kilalang number: ""you have quite an attitude, don't you?"" nanigas ako habang hawak ang cell phone sa isa kong kamay at kape sa kabila. habang prino-proseso ko ang tila breach sa personal security ko, naka-tanggap ulit ako ng dalawa pang mensahe. isa ay ang hubo't-hubad kong katawan na sinend ko sa una kong serious college boyfriend. ang pangalawa: ""bakit hindi mo ngayon ibigay 'yang picture sa hr?"" sa totoo lang, sobrang naapektuhan ako sa invasion ng privacy ko. pumasok ang kahihiyan sa akin at sobrang naiinis ako for drawing so much unwanted attention sa sarili ko. kasalanan ko lahat 'to. pumasok ako sa isang office na puno ng ethical hackers na may pare-parehong pangalan ng aso bilang password. walang duda na ang litratong iyon ay umiikot na sa buong office at lahat ng iyon ay salamat sa walang hiyang ka-trabaho ko, at isa na akong kakatuwang tao sa loob ng office. hindi ko na ginalaw ang kape ko at umuwi na lang, habang pinipigilan ko ang bawat emosyon na bumuhos hanggang makarating ako sa safety ng bahay. halos hindi ako matigil sa kaiiyak nung gabing 'yun, iniisip ko na ang mga mukha ng mga ka-trabaho ko habang tigang na tigang na nakatitig sa hubad kong katawan. mga alas tres na ng madaling araw, doon ko lang na-realize na wala ng kwenta para pa magpaka-lunod ako sa kahihiyan. kailangan kong gumawa ng plano para maka-survive sa ganitong uri ng workplace. quitting is not an option kasi masyadong malaki ang pasweldo nila para tumigil ako. tsaka, halos tinapay na lang ang kaya kong bilhin sa araw-araw. ang pangalawa kong option ay pumunta sa hr, but there's no way i was going to open that can of worms. hindi ko mapapatunayan kong sino talaga ang nag-send ng mga mensahe na iyon. last option? stick with it, keep my head down, gawin ang trabaho na pinasukan ko at 'wag pansinin ang iba pang mga harassment na gagawin nila. 'yun nga ang ginawa ko. sa kabuuan ng isang linggong training ko ay pumapasok ako on time, hindi ako umaalis sa desk ko liban na lang kung pupunta sa palikuran. iniwasan ko rin ang kahit anong contact kanino man at pinanatili ko lang ang aking mga mata sa mga inanimate objects. salamat kay j. espiritu, palagi akong on top ng training ko. sa bawat bagong task na galing sa manager ko, laging may katumbas na entry sa kanyang notebook. wala ng nakaka-gagong texts at face-to-face na kumprontasyon, pero mayroong kakatuwang pakiramdam na panibagong sisira sa kalagayan ko. sa darating na biyernes na ang huling training ko, na nagdala sa akin sa huling entry sa notebook. night shift survival guide: - matulog sa buong umaga bago ang shift at 'wag na 'wag kang matutulog. - walang sino man ang dapat maka-pasok. - panatilihing may pepper spray na dala. (sa kahit anong sitwasyon). - i-check ang bawat aisle, meeting rooms. huwag kalimutang i-check ang ilalim ng lamesa, balkonahe, kitchen tables at kahit likod ng cooler. - laging mag-open ng skype na naka-ready sa emergency in case na hindi gumana ang mobile services. - panatilihing updated sa kaibigan/pamilya/lover kada oras. ang nasabing listahan ay medyo may kahulugan. una, sabi ng hr puwede naman akong matulog sa pagitan ng 2-5 am, basta malapit palagi sa akin ang office smartphone. mayroon nga silang pull out couch sa isang conference room para lang talaga sa ganitong sitwasyon. pangalawa, ang buong shift ay phone calls, kaya palaging may paraan para maka-tawag mula sa office phone, tama? lastly, ang mga naka-outlined sa ""guide"" ay parang o.a at paranoid. siguro 'yung listahan ay satirical? (ewan ko). siguro si espiritu parehas kami ng pakiramdam tungkol sa mga tila patay gutom na mga asong cold-blooded na co-workers? pero 'yung isip ko nag-tatrabaho ng sobra-sobra para makita ang logic sa likod ng mga pag-iingat na ito. may kakatuwa akong pakiramdam na may importanteng impormasyon akong hindi nalalaman. lahat 'yun iniisip ko habang paalis ako ng bahay nung biyernes na 'yun, last day ng training ko. ""andrew"", - dahan-dahan akong lumapit sa kanya. ""puwede ba mag-tanong?"" ""sure thing"", - sagot n'ya na may maaliwalas na ngiti sa kanyang mga labi. ""nagtataka lang ako, bakit wala akong nakikitang ibang support agents. i mean, 'di ba dapat merong at least lima pang tao para ma-cover 'yung six-day rotation cycle?"" ""kailangan mong tanungin ang manager mo tungkol d'yan. most likely naka-kalat sila sa iba pang branch sa syudad. normal lang naman 'yun sa ganoong kaso"", - sagot n'ya. pakiramdam ko tapos na kami sa diskusyon na 'yun matapos s'yang bumalik sa final tasks n'ya para sa linggong iyon. ""meron bang ibang agent na nag-trabaho dito liban sa akin?"" - pagpapatuloy ko, dahil ganun na lamang ang kagustuhan kong malaman ang iba pang detalye sa babaeng nag-fill out ng notebook na s'ya namang ginagamit ko sa buong linggong iyon. ""oo, may isang babae na humawak sa posisyon mo ng panandalian"", - ani ni andrew, habang naka-titig pa rin sa screen ng kanyang screen. pero napansin kong tumigil na s'ya sa pag-tatype o pag-galaw ng mouse. wari ko ay naka-titig lang s'ya sa iisang spot sa monitor n'ya. ""andrew"", - nag-salubong ang mga kilay ko. ""sino 'yung nag-trabaho malapit sa main working space na talagang nakaka-inis? maputla, medyo payat, maitim at kulot na buhok?"" - tanong ko, habang nagpapaikot ng daliri sa bandang ulunan ko para i-describe ang pagkaka-kulot ng nasabing lalake. ""ah... si michael"", - sagot nito, napansin nito ang pagiging iritable ng boses ko. ""may problema ba? ginugulo ka ba n'ya?"" ""hindi"" - sagot ko, pero sa isip-isip ko ay nagtatalo na ang emosyon at sarili ko. ""have a good weekend, andrew"" ""ikaw din"", - sagot nito, halata na may pagtataka sa boses nito habang papaalis ako. sa buong weekend na 'yun ay binabalik-balikan ko ang mga nangyari sa akin sa unang linggo ko. pakiramdam ko may hindi sinasabi si andrew sa akin na importante. wala namang rason para maging iretable s'ya nung nabanggit ko 'yung babaeng nag-trabaho bago ako. may nag-reklamo na kaya kay michael dati? pu-puwede kayang si j. espiritu? si michael ba ang dahilan ng survival guide sa notebook? bakit s'ya umalis? napaka-daming teorya ang bumagabag sa buong weekend ko. bago ko pa nalaman, oras na para bumalik sa trabaho. ito ang araw na talagang sobrang daming trabaho. kahapon ay lunes, ang unang regular day shift. mabilis lang dumaan ang nasabing araw, habang aligaga ako sa pag-sagot ng tawag, recording, sorting at assigning ng dose-dosenang customer complaints sa system namin. hindi sapat ang salitang nasanay na ako at pagkatapos ng araw na 'yun ay sobrang pagod at ubos na ako. saktong maglo-logout na ako, naka-tanggap na naman ako ng mensahe mula sa hindi kilalang number. ""ang sipag mo naman. hindi na ako makapag-hintay na mag night shift ka"" seryoso?! ito ang kauna-unahang mensahe na bumalot sa buong pagkatao ko ng takot. agad-agad kong ginala ang paningin ko kung nasa paligid ba si michael para kumprontahin ko s'ya sa pagse-send ng mensahe, pero kanina pa pala s'ya umalis. matapos kong pakalmahin ang sarili ko, umuwi na ako at sinusubukan kong hanapin si j. espiritu online. ang pinaka best bet ko noon ay sa linkedin, at doon nga ay sinusubukan kong galugarin ang buong listahan ng mga babae na may kinalaman sa proficient technologies na naka-lagay sa profile nila (halos kakaunti lang talaga sila). nung wala akong makita ay pumunta ako kay andrew at doon nga sa friend list n'ya ay sa wakas nakita ko na ang hinahanap ko. may babae na pangalan ay jennah espiritu at unemployed ang status. nag-send ako ng friend request na may mensahe na nag-papakilala at tinanong ko s'ya kung hinarass ba s'ya ng isa n'yang ka-trabaho. sa wakas, pakiramdam ko may patutunguhan na ako, natulog ako at inihanda ang sarili para sa bukas na event. naisip ko na baka may kakaibang mangyayari dahil sa pagbabago ng schedule nung natulog ako ng miyerkules. nag-check ako ng linkedin halos pagka-gising ko mga ala una. walang kahit anong sign kay jennah, kaya naman natulog ulit ako para makapag-handa sa night shift. medyo kinakabahan ako at excited at the same time kasi puwede ko ng mas malibot ang buong place of work ko intimately. dahil walang day crowd, malaya akong makaka-gala at ma-eenjoy ang cookies, dumura sa baso ni michael, kahit ano! may mga iilan pa ring mga nag-tatrabaho nung dumating ako para sa shift ko, pero hindi ko naman iyon pinansin at dahil sa nag-uumapaw na mga tawag at chats na aasikasuhin. makalipas ang dalawang oras, ang bugso ng mga tawag at chats pati mga tickets ay unti-unting bumagal hanggang tuluyan na nga itong tumigil ng sabay-sabay halos alas onse na ng gabi noon. sumandal ako sa kinauupuan ko at ginala-gala ang mga paningin sa aking workspace. wala ng tao noon sa office at least sa nakikita ko. naka-bukas ang lahat ng ilaw pero nung tinanggal ko ang headphones ko, may narinig akong mahinang jingling melody sa hindi kalayuan. para s'yang christmas carol, pero hirap akong tukuyin kong saan ito nangga-galing. wala namang dahilan para matakot ako sa pangyayari, pero pakiramdam ko ang mga nagtayuang balahibo sa mga kamay ko ay nagsilbing alarm. nang tumayo ako sa aking kinauupuan, nawala 'yung melody. well, naging paranoid na ako dati. minsan ko ng inisip na na may lalaking sumusunod sa akin isang gabi hanggang nilagpasan n'ya ako at nagtungo sa kalapit na tindahan sa 'di kalayuan. kahit mag-isa lang ako, lagi kong dino-double at triple check ang mga lock ng bahay bago matulog. aaminin ko na ang mga takot ko ay wala naman talagang basehan. mayroong naka-iwan ng headphones na konektado pa rin sa computer nito at naka-on ang music. o siguro may office party sa ibang kumpanya sa baba ng building. ang makarinig ng kanta ay nakaka-takot lamang sa mga kakatuwang horror movies, 'di ba? 'di ba?! para maka-siguro, hinalughog ko ang office para maka-siguro na mag-isa na nga lang ako. habang naglalakad sa gitna ng mga magkaka-dikit na desks, naisip ko kung gaano ako ka-swerte na mayroon akong sariling corner spot. hindi ko siguro kakayanin na mapalapit sa kahit sinong mga hindi kaaya-aya kong mga co-workers. matapos ko ma-check ang bawat rows ay dumiretcho ako sa front desk area at nagmamasid sa mga kagamitan ni andrew sa paghahanap ng clues. nung wala akong makitang clues ay bumalik ako sa main room ng pantry. unti-unti ng mas nagiging relaxed ang mga senses ko at tsaka ko lang napag-tanto na napasarap ata ang taste-testing ko sa mga cookies sa halip na mag-hanap ng mga kahina-hinalang mga bagay. kailangan ko ng tumigil sa kaka-kain ng cookies, pero dahil bumalik na naman ang kaninang tunog na naririnig ko, mas malakas s'ya ngayon. at the same time, ang work smartphone ko (na kinakailangan dala-dala namin kung aalis kami sa aming work station) tumunog at may mensahe mula sa hindi na namang kilalang number. so, nag-eenjoy ka ba sa cookies, ha? nanigas ang buong katawan ko habang prino-proseso ng utak ko ang mga pangyayari. siguro hindi talaga umalis ng office si michael at ngayon tinatakot ako. kinalikot ko ang tenga ko noon at nakinig ng maigi. walang kahit sino sa pantry as least sa nakikita at naririnig ko. tsaka, kung si michael ay nasa main workspace, hindi naman ganun kahirap na hulaan o sabihin na kumakain ako ng cookies. habang dahan-dahan akong humihinga, hindi ko muna pinansin ang tunog at nakinig ako ng maigi kung may iba pa akong tunog na maririnig. wala. dahan-dahan, naglakad ako sa may pantry drawers at doon may nakita akong malaking kutsilyo. alam ko bang gumamit ng kutsilyo? hindi. kaya ko kayang paalisin kung sino man ang unarmed na kalaban? syempre. papunta na sana ako pabalik sa aking work station ng biglang may tawag na pumasok mula sa work phone. ipinosisyon ko ang sarili ko ng kumportable sa pader ng pantry, kutsilyo sa kanang kamay, cell phone sa kabila, bago pa ako maka-sagot with the standard customer support greeting. nag static na sa kabilang linya at iba pang ingay sunod ang tuluyang pagka-putol ng linya at katahimikan. nung tinignan ko ang cell phone, nakita kong naka-patay na ito. sinubukan kong buksan ulit ito, pero hindi na ito gumagana. ok, ngayon kailangan ko ng bumalik sa computer ko in case na may pumasok pang mga tawag. naalala ko bigla ang isa sa mga guide na galing kay jennah habang isinusuksok ko ang walang kwentang cell phone sa bulsa ko. - laging mag-open ng skype na naka-ready sa emergency in case na hindi gumana ang mobile services. nangyari rin kaya 'to sa kanya? ang mga instructions sa notebook ay unti-unti ng nagkaroon ng kahulugan, at minumura ko ang sarili ko dahil sa pagiging tanga. sa oras na lumabas ang mga salita sa bibig ko ay may isa na namang mensahe ang dumating sa cell phone. kinuha ko iyon at sinubukang i-unlock, pero 'yung regular home screen ay hindi lumalabas. ang lumabas lang ay isang white screen na may maikling text. putang ina. ang mga babae dapat hindi ginagamit ng ganung mga uri ng salita. matapos kong mabasa 'yun ay nawala na ito sa screen at may panibagong text ang lumabas. bakit hindi ka lumabas at makipag-laro? huwag mo ng isiping bitbitin pa 'yang kutsilyong hawak mo. wala ring magagawa 'yan sa hawak kong baril. tinapon ko ang cell phone ko sa lapag at agad-agad ay nagtungo ako sa aking computer. ang tunog ay mas lalong lumakas habang papalapit ako sa aking lamesa, doon ay nakita kong may isang baboy na stuffed toy. may fabric button ito sa bandang paanan at music note na kasama. dito nagmumula ang tunog at nagpapatunay lamang na hindi ako mag-isa at may kung sino akong kasama. ang malala pa, pinapanood nila ang bawat galaw ko at sinusubukang takutin gamit ang mga laruang pambata. unti-unti ng dumadaloy ang pagpapanic sa aking buong katawan at naghahanda na sa fight or flight scenario. huminga ako ng malalim, sinusubukan kong pakalmahin ang buong katawan ko. so far wala pa naman akong naririnig ng kahit anong palatandaan na may ibang tao sa loob ng office. may mga background noises galing sa syudad sa labas at ang mga ingay mula sa naka-limutang patayin na computer ng isang employee. kung sino man ang gumagawa nito sa akin, kailangan kong malaman ang kanilang eksaktong lokasyon para maplano ko ng maayos ang pag-takas ko. isa pa, kailangan kong maka-kuha ng tulong sa lalong mas madaling panahon. habang iginigilid ko ang laruan ay umupo na ako sa aking upuan at pinull-up ang skype for business application. mabilis akong nag-dial ng 911, habang naka-loudspeaker ang telepono. tumunog na nga ang dial tone at agad-agad ay may live operator na sa kabilang linya. ibibigay ko na sana ang mga hindi kanais-nais na pangyayari sa akin ng mga oras na iyon ng may biglang humawak sa bukong-bukong ko mula sa ilalim ng lamesa. halos maubos ang buong lakas ko sa pagsigaw habang nagpu-pumiglas ang mga paa at mabilis na tumakbo sa abot ng aking makakaya sa bilis na hindi ko akaling kaya ko. may narinig akong kung anong kumusyon sa aking likuran habang tumakbo, kasunod ng isang malakas ng putok, na inisip ko na lamang na galing sa kung ano o sino man ang humahabol sa akin. bago ko pa malaman ay halos nasa ground floor na ako papunta sa pinto lagpas sa gwardiya na halatang nagulat sa mga nangyayari. ang malamig na hangin ay mabilis na pumasok sa manipis kong sweater habang papalapit ako sa isang malapit na pedestrian para humingi ng tulong. tumawag sila ng 911 at ang mga pulis ay agad namang dumating wala pang sampung minuto. habang naghihintay ako kasama ang gwardiya para sa kanilang pag-dating, hindi maalis sa isip ko ang sinulat ni jennah na warning, at kung gaano ako ka-tanga para ipagsa walang bahala ang mga ito. - i-check ang ang bawat aisle, meeting room. huwag kalimutang i-check ang ilalim ng lamesa, balkonahe, kitchen tables at kahit likod ng cooler. agad-agad namang sinulat ng pulis ang mga nangyari sa akin at iniwan ako kasama ang isang pulis officer, umakyat s'ya para i-check ang office. wala namang naka-labas-masok sa building mula nung tumakbo ako palabas, kaya malaki ang posibilidad na naroroon pa rin ang salarin at nagtatago sa loob. sa pag-iisip ay halos bumaliktad ang buong sikmura ko at mas lalo akong lumapit sa may armas kong kasama. maya-maya pa matapos kaming iwanan ng mga pulis, ang kasama kong pulis ay nag-radyo at isa-isa may mga boses na nagpapa-palit-palit sa radyo na humingi ng backup at nga mga codes na hindi ko maintindihan. mabilis na nag-escalate ang mga sumunod na pangyayari. imbis na pauwi ay dinala nila ako sa police station at doon ay nanatili ako sa isang interrogation room ng halos 2 oras bago pa sa wakas may dalawang pulis officer ang kumausap sa akin. pagod na ako noon, miserable ang kalagayan at higit sa lahat litong-lito sa kung papaano naganap ang mga pangyayari. gusto ko ng umuwi pero nanatili pa ako ng ilang oras para i-kuwento ang mga pangyayari sa dalawang pulis officer. 'ahh... meron kang kutsilyong hawak habang tumakbo ka galing sa pantry papunta sa lamesa mo? sigurado ka ba?' tanong ng isang nakaka-tandang officer na nagpakilala bilang senior investigator manlapig. 'ah. ah... oo.' pautal-utal kong sagot sa kanya. 'naniniwala akong meron. nag-papanic na ako noon, kaya mahirap sabihin. tapos may baboy na stuffed toy, ' sabi ko, habang tila baga'y nawawalan ako ng abilidad na mag-isip ng tama. 'at naniniwala ka na ang taong humaharass sa'yo ay si michael villareal?' sabi ng isa pang officer, hindi ko maalala 'yung pangalan n'ya. wala s'yang badge. 'hindi ko alam buong pangalan n'ya, pero wala na akong ibang kilala na iba pang responsable.' 'at sa huling pagkakataon, just for the record, anong nangyari matapos mong mag-dial ng 911?' tanong ni manlapig sa ika-apat na pagkakataon sa gabing 'yun. 'may kung sino ang humawak sa binti ko. bukong-bukong, actually. nangyari 'yun bago pa ako magkaroon ng pagkakataong ipaliwanag ang sitwasyon sa operator. nagsusumigaw at piglas ang mga paa ko tapos tumakbo hanggang may makita akong tao sa labas na pina-tawag ako sa 911 para sa tulong.' sagot ko, habang pagod na pagod sa paulit-ulit at paikot-ikot na pagtatanong. 'si michael villareal ay natagpuang patay sa hindi kalayuan ng iyong lamesa nung pumunta ang officer namin sa pinang-yarihan ng insidente. nakita mo ba ang kanyang katawan nung tumakbo ka palabas ng office?' tanong ng isang officer. halos malaglag ang panga ko sa mga narinig ko at tumitig sa dalawang pulis habang balisa at nanginginig sa takot. 'hi.. hi.. hindi,' pabulong akong nag-salita, 'hindi ko maintindihan,' 'sinaksak s'ya hanggang sa mamatay gamit ang malaking kutsilyo. ang katawan n'ya ay balot ng dalawampu't-tatlong saksak,' paliwanag ni manlapig. 'at nakita namin ang kutsilyo ay nakabaon sa bibig nito, dahilan para dumikit ito sa sahig diretcho sa lalamunan,' 'may rason kami para pagsuspetyahan na ito rin ang sinasabi mong kutsilyo,' dagdag pa ng pangalawang officer. nakatitig ako sa dalawang pulis officer ng tahimik, hirap akong intindihin ang mga pangyayari lalo na't ang utak ko ay halos mawala na sa ulirat. 'ang mga sinabi mo ay nagpapatunay lamang sa mga natagpuaan namin sa cell phone ni michael villareal. nalaman namin na may roon siyang hacking apps,' pagpapatuloy ng senior officer. 'natagpuan din naman ang ilan mo pang mga hubong larawan at ang mga mensahe na iyong nabanggit. mayroon s'yang baril at nakita rin naman ang basyo ng bala nung binaril ka n'ya habang papatakas ka.' 'ang hindi namin maintindihan ay kung papaano s'ya namatay.' dagdag pa ng pangalawang officer, halatang hindi s'ya naniniwala sa aking reaksyon. 'ok lang kung napatay mo s'ya dahil sa self-defense, aya. may balak s'yang masama sa'yo.' 'hindi,' pautal-utal kong sagot. 'pangako, wala akong ideya... oh, oh my god.' naiyak na ako dahil sa mga nangyayari. 'ibig kong sabihin, nung nakaraang buwan lang may nag-report sa kanya galing sa isa n'yang co-worker,' sabi ni manlapig. 'jennah,' bulong ko. 'kilala mo si miss espiritu?' tanong ng pangalawang officer, at ng suspetya sa kanyang mga mats. 'hindi,' ako ang pumalit sa lamesa n'ya at nakuha ko ang notebook n'ya. dapat sinabi ko na 'to kanina pa. anong sabi sa report? doon nga ay nagtitigan ang dalawang pulis at maka-lipas ang ilang sandali ay inilatag at ipinaliwanag ni manlapig ang mga hindi magandang nangyari kay jennah na halos mangyari na sa akin. si jennah espiritu ay dumiretcho sa pinaka-malapit na hospital mula sa kanyang unang night shift tatlong buwan na ang nakakaraan. sobrang bugbog ng katawan n'ya at sugatan, at gustong mag-file ng anonymous rape kit. ang natanong damage n'ya sa kanyang puwerta ay sobrang severe na kinailangan n'yang sumailalim sa operasyon at magpatahi. nag-file s'ya ng police report makalipas ang dalawang buwan matapos s'yang hindi pumasa sa probationary period sa inyong kumpanya, ng nawala s'ya sa trabaho (ang nagiisang paraan para mabayaran ang kanyang utang sa hospital). ang nangyari ay ang kanyang aligasyon kontra kay michael villareal, na gumastos s'ya ng malaki sama mo pa ang hindi mabilang na kanyang mga co-workers na kumontra sa kanya laban sa magalang at kaaya-ayang katangian ni michael. 'pero kahapon lang ay iniurong na n'ya lahat ng mga isinampa n'yang kaso kay michael,' sabi ng walang badge na pulis. 'kasalukuyan naming inaalam ang kinaroroonan ni espiritu para ma-interview namin s'ya. sigurado ako na ngayon malinaw na kung bakit may suspetya kami sa iyo bilang nakikilala mo espiritu.' nagpatuloy ang mga tanong ng dalawang pulis hanggang may isang lalaki na nag-abot sa kanya ng isang sobre. natukoy na ng forensics ang fingerprint na nakita sa kutsilyo at ang blood-spatter patterns. kinailangan ko ring mag-submit ng dna samples para maka-tulong sa imbestigasyon at sa wakas ay pina-uwi na nila ako. sa bahay, dahil sa sobrang pagod, hindi ako maka-tulog. wala akong gamit na naiuwi. bag, cell phone at kahit ang jacket ko ay kinailangan i-submit bilang ebidensya. kaya naman napilitan akong gamitin ang luma kong laptop, umaasa na malibang sa internet. ang browser ko ay naka-login pa rin sa linkedin account ko mula sa nakaraang login, at nirefreshed ko ang page bilang naka-sanayan. isang maliit na red icon ang lumitaw na mayroon akong bagong mensahe. jennah. nagre-reply na s'ya sa akin. don't worry, sis. i took care of it. ❤️",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/t77k69/tagalized_story/,5 03 2022
Moving out/running away from my emotionally abusive father who was away for 10 years,"tl;dr: emotionally abusive ofw father recently came home after 10 years and we had a huge fight which made me too uncomfortable too stay in this house. already planned to move out even before he came home but he might think i'm moving out because of him (tho it's also true). i don't know how to tell him that i'm moving out knowing his tendencies hello, i’m 23 years old and my father was an ofw for 10 years. i won't go into details sa history ng pagiging emotionally abusive/manipulative niya before and during the time na nasa abroad siya since that would be too long considering na mahaba din yung story. anyways, umuwi siya last month and since di sila okay ng mother ko, umalis na yung mother ko sa bahay so natira kami ng kuya ko. nung first two days ang bait niya so naisip ko parang ang judgemental ko na inisip ko mga masasamang bagay sa kanya dati but then i was immediately proved wrong. on the second night pumasok siya sa kwarto ko nang lasing at 1 am and patulog na ako since may work pa the next day. verbatimly sabi niya “lasing tatay mo” and then proceed to ask some questions, catching up ganun and at the same time ilang beses niya inuulit na na tabi daw kami matulog and despite me saying no multiple times, lumapit pa rin siya at tumabi. at first wala akong ginawa since tatabi lang naman but then sumiksik siya nang sumiksik and that’s when i got uncomfortable so tumayo ako at lumabas ng kwarto para sana uminom ng tubig pero sumunod siya sa baba so tumakbo ako pabalik ng kwarto and nilock yung pinto. he kept on knocking and calling for my name pero ang sagot ko lang ay “matulog ka na pa bukas na tayo mag usap pag di ka na lasing” but of course he kept on denying na lasing siya. eventually he said “sisirain ko ‘tong pinto mo” and started banging on the door loudly tapos may ginagawa pa siyang di ko alam sa doorknob so i started shouting saying na ipapabarangay ko siya pag di siya tumigil but he didn’t stop and confidently said “oh sige” until he finally opened the door without a key. that alone was scary plus may expression pa sa mukha niya na di ko maexplain basta nakakatakot so tumakbo ako malapit sa kwarto ng kuya ko just in case na may gawin siya. sumunod siya then he started his manipulative sad boi session saying na 10 years siya nagsakripisyo para samin tapos ganun lang turing ko sa kanya, how he always wanted to go to college dati pero hindi kaya ng parents niya so nag ofw siya para hindi namin maexperience yun. hindi daw siya nanunumbat but kept on saying na hindi ako makakapag aral sa ganitong school kung di dahil sa kanya which is factually wrong since yung nanay ko yung nababaon sa utang para lang makabayad sa tuition namin dahil bihira siya magpadala. sinisigawan niya ko the whole time habang dinuduro duro ako. nakipag sigawan din ako asking questioning his actions that night then i made mention of the other traumatizing things he did and how he never realized that he's wrong but he kept on mentioning the 10 years/gusto niya magcollege. i ended it by saying na hindi ko naman ginusto mabuhay bakit siya nag anak tapos isusumbat niya lang lahat. days after that he started acting nice again cooking my favorite foods, other acts of service, etc but there was no apology, he’s acting like nothing happened and that we’re ok. i mean gets naman na ganun yung karamihan ng parents but the experience was not the same for me. until now i’m still anxious whenever we’re in the same room so i’m trying my best para umiwas magtatanong nga lang kung kumain na ako kumakabog na dibdib ko. di siya kumakatok sa pinto bago pumasok so iniiwan ko nalang na bukas para marinig ko and maready ko sarili ko pag papasok siya. and lastly tuwing iinom siya (around 3 times a week) kailangan ko i-barricade yung pinto sa takot. basta this home is no longer a safe place for me and gusto ko na lumipat plus kami rin naman ng kuya ko yung nagbabayad sa lahat ng gastusin. may nakita na akong lilipatan na malapit dun sa area kung saan nagsstay nanay ko tho dito pa rin sa barangay yung place. pinapalipat na ko next week and i don't know kung pano ako magpapaalam without any drama knowing na may sadboi tendencies nga yung tatay ko. tbh plan ko na talaga lumipat ng bahay by the end of the year bago pa umuwi yung tatay ko, baka kasi isipin niya na lilipat ako ng bahay dahil sa kanya tho it's true, hindi naman yun yung sole reason. i don't know what reactions i will get since the last time na nagpost ako dito about him natawag akong ""entitled brat"" for not appreciating his sacrifice despite showing evidence of him being an asshole but i just wanted to share my experience and maybe get some advice on how to tell him that i'm moving out",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/r6d7on/moving_outrunning_away_from_my_emotionally/,1 12 2021

sincerely from me.* so i'm posting this update para sa mga redditors na nag follow kay nala especially sa mga nag donate. **may 22:** around 2 days after i posted a cry for help sa r/philippines nala isn't getting any better, kumakain pa din may gana pero hindi na ganun kalakas kagaya dati. but thursday night hindi siya kumain which is hindi naman nakakabahala, unfortunately morning to tanghali ayaw niya pa rin kumain so i tried carrying her and kinakausap ko siya but she's not responding. nabahala ako so tinry ko siya itayo para maglakad lakad pero bumabagsak lang siya ulit, nagpanic na ako so i called his original vet if he could help. i know it's a reach kasi ecq pa pero makakapunta daw siya hintayin ko daw siya sa bahay. when he arrived he told me to rush nala sa clinic nila (his original vet clinic) so nalaman ko nagbukas na pala sila around 2nd week of may. sinugod namin si nala sa furry friends sa caloocan and luckily siya lang ang patient non. they told me na grabe na yung damage sa skin niya and saw na baka may maggots yung paws na niya. they also told me that amputation is possible kapag unrepairable na or nabubulok na sugat niya especially sa paws at sa tail. masyado dinb daw manipis balat ni nala and napakadaming flakes na nagfafall off from her body kaya siya nangangati. &#x200b; [at furry friends clinic](https://preview.redd.it/saqrwsbx70251.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9443944503ec0cdd2041bd25de98691f5de3085b) i decided to skin scrape and cbc her. never pa siya na cbc, so ayun ang goal ko kasi hindi ko alam bakit hindi pa siya gumagaling since march. sa skin scrape nakita na meron siyang demodex (hindi ko po alam spelling) pero its an insect that causes itchyness and galis. she's positive for mange. the problem is usually marami na daw yung 1 to 2 na insect sa isang skin scrape pero sa kanya 12 (take note na hindi pa yun sa sugat kumuha) which indicates na sobrang abnormal na ng dami nung parasites. &#x200b; [shivers and cleaning ng sugat niya](https://preview.redd.it/eewwtclz70251.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=47d84285281125ed50cf12986e72905fba1b77b2) they told me this is caused by stress. dapat daw na cocontrol ng immune system niya yung pagdami nun kaso dahil na stress siya most probably because of the grooming kasi dun nagsimula siya mangati, sobrang dumami yung demodex. they even showed me what's on the microscope. nakakalungkot isipin na dahil lang sa simpleng grooming nagkaganyan na yung dating healthy na siya. cbc came out and they saw an abnormality sa mga components. may bacterial infection siya kaya bumababa ata ang hemoglobin niya hindi ko gaanong sure. while we were discussing, nala started to shiver and the doctor said na kinokombulsyon siya kasi 40 degrees yung temperature niya. &#x200b; [sorry nabura na yung cbc na naka attach, i also lost the computation how much it costs but naka php 3200 ako, she has around 6 na iniintake and a spray, plus the three injections.](https://preview.redd.it/z82q4n1380251.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9adfcdb1977fff2d30706a925e9023975745cb67) &#x200b; https://preview.redd.it/50ji08fa80251.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bea67e1d3f2a8d1a55a0fcf680fe2d1c326b73b0 they cleaned her sugat. and injected her three times. yung dalawa anti mange/anti parasite and yung isa for her fever. they told me na this will be a 6 week long na gamutan and babalik kami dun every friday starting 22. i agreed. they also told me to stop seeking for convenia because it'll be too costly and hindi sure na gagana, at least eto daw proven, they told me to make nala sa comfortable as possible to reduce her stress. bumalik na kami last friday and the doctors said na shes getting better albeit she lost .4 kg. pinalitan na din namin diet niya to reflex pero hindi niya gaanong kinakain. she's still weak, barely walking but nakakalakad na at least. the first 3 days din from 22 kamot siya ng kamot as in walang tigil kaya nakaka stress pero since monday she stopped itching na. nagtatanggalan na langib niya din. &#x200b; [her favorite spot on my chair](https://preview.redd.it/evaj95l190251.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=575df5eb0c79a5f0e8595cdfc248329bbbb63014) &#x200b; &#x200b; [latest pic, hindi na reddish skin niya and nagtatanggalan na scabs niya.](https://preview.redd.it/lpfmo7t390251.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4cbf0b6cdff492d9a6045c04268ec1345d1f9533) i**'m here to post this update to thank you guys for the support.** masakit man, pero kelangan ko kayo because some of my family members think na sayang lang ang pera sa kanya at ipamigay na lang daw namin tapos bumili na lang kami ng aso. i had arguments with my family because of this. maraming salamat po, she's recovering slowly pero hindi namin siya titigilan hanggang sa hindi siya gumagaling! **donations are still welcome, sobrang maappreciate namin yung donation because i barely have anything left.** 6 weeks na gamutan pa siya and every week may injection sa kanya. i hope na you guys are still willing to donate to an anonymous stranger and his dog. *if you are willing to donate please drop me a dm. pwede na din po bank kasi nakausap ko na gf ko and she lent me her bank account for donations.* ***please dm me for account # or gcash.*** &#x200b; thank you so much!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/gtqe7f/update_on_nala_my_maltichon/,31 05 2020
[NEED MEDICAL/LEGAL ADVICE] Doctor refused to sign my medical documents,"hi everyone! i don't know where else to ask this. or if this is a valid case to get a lawyer? can someone please enlighten me... 🙏 january 5 kasi, nagpasugod ako sa er ng isang private hospital dahil nag diarrhea ako with blood, and laging masakit tyan and joints ko then na admit ako from january 6-12. i have 3 different doctors. wala po akong pinili sakanila, sila lang ang nirefer ng health card ko sakin. and sa pagkatagal tagal kong nagstay dun, napagdecide nila na for ct scan ako. it happened january 11. yung 2 doctors, after lumabas ng results ng ct scan kinausap ako. (surgeon and rheumatologist) they agreed na bumuti na yung condition ko during my week-long stay. and base sa results ng ct scan, okay naman. no need for surgery, continue the medication nalang. pumayag na sila madischarge ako and mag followup nalang. so nagpa discharge na ko. however, nung kukuha na ko ng mga medical documents and fit to work, yung 1 doctor (gastro specialist) which is my main physician pa, gusto pa ng isang test dahil parang may nakikita daw syang bato sa gallbladder. i should do mrcp/ercp test pa daw. in her own firm words, ""never"" nya kong bibigyan ng fit to work and sign my medical documents. dahil need ko daw po muna gawin yung test na nirerequire nya, and for possible surgery daw po yung case ko. which is nag refuse na ko dahil... (1) inubos na nila laman ng health card ko (2) wala na rin akong cash pang test (3) i'm feeling better now (4) i think i have the ""right"" to decline because its my body? (5) no one even bothered to tell me how ct scan is done. i asked multiple nurses and parang ultrasound lang daw, ""uncomfy"" lang daw. claustrophobic po ako, at sobrang nginig at takot ko nung nandun na ko feeling ko mahihimatay na ko sa kaba. then i asked how is mrcp/ercp done, same as ct scan lang daw. 🙃 (6) i'm ready to die-- in fact, i'd rather die than do the test again. i asked her what are my other options. do the test lang daw. she wouldn't give me a fit to work dahil hindi nya daw po iririsk yung medical license nya giving ftw to someone na hindi naman talaga fit to work 🥴 kahit pumirma pa daw ako ng waiver. im not sure but i think mrsp cost around 20k+, kasi yung ct scan sakin is 25k already. i told her wala po talaga akong pera pang test, her answer is ""its not my problem anymore"". i asked help from my 2 other doctors at baka sila na pwede mag sign, no. si doc gastro daw kasi main physician ko so sakanya daw talaga dapat. help, i respect naman po her decisions pero tama po ba na kahit ayaw na ng patient, kahil alam na ng patient yung risk and ayaw talagang ituloy, need po ba talaga sumunod sa gusto ni doc magpatest and possible surgery? hindi po ako makabalik sa work ko kasi need yung documents. tinry na kausapin ng company doctor namin si gastro specialist, and same lang din sinasabi. i dont know much about medical and legal field. so i'd appreciate any help. asking for legal advice kasi baka this is something na pwede ilaban lol. kung hindi, edi wag. wag na tayo pastress. =========== tldr; kelangan ko ng signed medical documents para makabalik sa work, pero ayaw i-sign ng main doctor ko kasi hindi ko nasunod yung gusto nya na magpa-test pa. 💸 =========== thanks in advance. p.s. sabi ni doc bawal ako mastress at mapagod, pero bakit naman ganito sya mismo nagpapastress at papagod sakin magpabalik balik ng hospital 😵 & andami pa po nila kabalastugan for the whole duration of my stay (ex. they asked me to fast 48hrs for ct scan, yes 48) pero sobrang haba na para ichika ko pa lahat dito. gusto ko lang naman po bumalik na sa work...",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/kzvmoj/need_medicallegal_advice_doctor_refused_to_sign/,18 01 2021

Middle class ang talo sa Pilipinas,"tuwing sakuna, pag mayaman ka, may pera ka kahit di ka aasa sa gobyerno. pag mahirap ka, bibigyan ka ng pera ng gobyerno. pero pag middle class ka, gagatasan kalang ng pera pero kung kailangan mo ng tulong, wala kang makukuha kasi ""may kaya ka naman."" i just saw my working parent's tax at sobrang laki parang di na ata makatarungan lalo na at ni pisong ayuda wala kami makuha nung bagyo, lockdown, at kung ano anong sakuna. nakakapanlumo maging lower middle class dito sa pinas at kitang kita ito during covid-19 lockdown. di naman sa pagiging elitista pero seryoso na usapan, bakit yung mga anak ng anak dito todo sinusuportahan ng gobyerno imbes na i educate about contraceptives? yung mga literal na palamunin (sugalero at may bisyo) pa ang binibigyan ayuda habang yung mga taong nagtatrabaho at nag contribute sa tax ay di manlang ma bigyan. ansakit lang sa dibdib makita na after covid-19 lockdown punong puno ang bentahan ng phone, salon, at kung ano ano pa nung nabigyan sila ng 6k na ayuda para dapat i imbak nila ng pagkain. isama nyo nadin nung bagyong odette, nasiraan din kami pero ni piso wala din binigay kasi nga diba ""may kaya"" daw. at yung mas nakakapanlumo is, yung mga mayayaman na loansharks, pineprendahan ng mga 4ps member ng atm card nila. what's worse? ang mga anak ng 4ps member nato ay di parin bayad ang bills sa school at most of them di padin marunong bumasa at magsulat. so how is this effective kung sabihin natin sa 10 na binibigyan, isa lang ang success story? no, this needs to be reevaluated! lastly, sa scholarships. palagi di makakaavail ang middle class kasi isa sa requirements ay maging ""poor,"" do we need to be below the poverty line before the government will even care about us? i have to be a working student to make ends meet and yung ibang naka avail nga nung scholarship daw ay either successful, not even good in school, or just close sa kay political person. nakakainip na talaga to sobra. walang pag asa kung middle class ka sa pinas. thanks for reading. i meant no hate. just pouring my heart out about the issues i see everyday here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/vvd0gr/middle_class_ang_talo_sa_pilipinas/,9 07 2022

Why I dont like (most) doctors,"i have bad experiences with doctors eversince i was a child. dont get me wrong, i have friends who are doctors, who are sincerely kind and nice, and true to their oath. but most that i have encountered are... rude, unapologetic, and arrogant. i know most of them save lives... but i dont think it gives them the right to act like they are gods. for me, i just treat them as professionals especially when i am paying them. well... i think thats the only way to treat doctors, as such. if i pay them, they shouldnt be rude and aholes. thats why i change doctors when i encounter as such. but when you are in a hospital and theres no choice but to accept whoever comes along, because its a matter of life and death, theres no choice but to accept an ahole doctor at the moment. i remember when my friend got beaten up and raped...and, because her face was swollen like a ballon from the beatings, the doctors at the er joked if she took too much steroids after we told them what happened. i remember when i was a student, and a doctor berated me for having tattoos and smoking. i remember when my mom was hospitalized, the nurse told me the specialist was too busy to answer our questions. i remember... well, a lot of bad experiences concerning doctors. i remember when we were pleading to a surgeon for more discount, na pwede ba 100k na lang ang fee nya dahil walang wala na kami, dahil more than 700k na ang hospital bill. sabi nya magbayad na lang kami ng direkta sa kanya, para 200k na lang ang fee so that wala ng extra 40-50k tax... at kung gusto namin ng resibo para sa anumang dahilan, magbayad kami ng p100 sa hospital (siguro kunwari yung p100 ang fee nya, at under the table and 200k). magpasalamat na lang daw kami na may discount kami sa tax, at siguro para makalabas na kami ng ospital. dyusko, talagang kung kani kanino kami lumapit para makahagilap at mamalimos ng pera, para hindi na madagdagan ang gastos namin sa ward ( kahit libre kasi ang ward, may gastusin pa rin kasi, para sa oxygen etc na umaabot ng 10 to 20k sa isang araw, liban pa sa gamot na kami ang bumibili). i always think ""paano pa kaya ang mas nangangailangan pa kesa sakin, sa mga ward, na naghihintay ng grasya at awa sa dyos .."" i have interviewed old doctors who became successful, they were nice... sabi nga ng isa minsan daw manok at prutas ang nakukuha nila. yung iba, ganun din daw. naisip ko, ang bait nila, at yumaman din sila (nabiyayaan). sabi nila, of course need ng pera, pero pag may naghihikahos sa pera, at buhay ang nakasalalay, mabigat daw sa kunsensya na gagatasan mo pa... yung iba nga, kung magkano lang daw ang kaya. yung iba libre (but im not really expecting this, since ang alam ko, nililibre lang ang doctors fee pag kakilala or vip na may kapalit na favor or maawain at mayaman ang doctor). kahit sa pagsagip ng buhay, di ba, uso pa rin ang connections. tulad ng surgeon na ayaw ng 100k, bahala na raw kami maghanap ng 200k since na-discountan kami sa tax. naisip ko, sana man lang pwede ng five gives o ano ang 200k, under the table naman kasi, di ba. pero kelangan daw diretcho at saktong 200k para makalabas kami ng ospital. kasi di kami ""connected"". maybe... a little compassion and understanding would help alleviate the hardhsips in life. then again, that tax discount is, after all, that little compassion and understanding... i just have to be thankful kesa wala, di ba. nakakalungkut lang. but i guess thats life... esp sa pilipinas na mahirap talaga ang maging mahirap (o kinakapos sa pera). sana naman wag magalit ang mga doctor na makakabasa nito. alam ko naman na lagi kayong puyat at pagod. ang sakin lang siguro, kami na nagbabayad sa inyo, pag naubos ang pera sa fees ninyo, wala kaming pahinga at umiiyak na lang. sa mga espesyalista, kaming maralita e di kayang mag paris o san man. dyan lang kami sa karinderya o tambay sa mall para magpa aircon. lahat naman tayo napapagod...at lahat tayo pag nasugatan, tao lang. wala pong dyos satin sa lupa. kaya sana maging mabait kayo at maging magalang sa pasyente kahit mahirap. again, hindi ko nilalahat... para sakin, karamihan lang e pangit ang asal. and to those who are compassionate, nice, and understanding, i salute you and wish you all the blessings in life. peace to all. [edit] much thanks to those who understood and empathized with my plight, and im sorry na nakaranas din kayo ng bad doctors. again, doctors are good for the community, any community as they save lives. but those who are aholes should just quit to stop giving those few sincere doctors a bad rep.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/14n2jt3/why_i_dont_like_most_doctors/,30 06 2023
[M]Y EXPERIENCE IN TUGUEGARAO CITY FLOODING. (Long post),"hello everyone! i'm from linao (east), tuguegarao city, yung sobrang lubog sa baha na barangay na trending sa buong social media. first and foremost, we[together with my fam & relatives] are safe from the flood(thanks god!). we are here at zone 2 of the barangay and yung totally flooded (lagpas bahay) is nasa zone 6 or 7, not quite sure. humuhupa na po ang baha at sana magtuloy-tuloy na. looking back at 11pm of nov. 13, 3 steps nalang po ng hagdan bago maabot ang 2nd floor ng bahay to think na elevated pa itong bahay so how much more na sa mga mabababang bahay, totally submerged na sila sa tubig baha. hindi makapasok ang mga rescuers dahil hindi kasya ang mga motorized rubber boats sa mga eskinita ng mga natrap na tao. idagdag mo ring zero visibility kasi napaka dilim dahil brownout sa buong lugar. iniisip na naming lumikas pero ang aking nanay at mga(3) tita ay kalmado lamang, nakahigang nasa likod ng ulo ang mga kamay at sabing ""sanay kami maligo sa dagat. huwag niyo kaming alalahanin, hindi kami aalis dito sa bahay"". sobrang nakakatakot sa labas kasi napakalakas ng agos ng baha, isang maling tapak at na-outbalance ka, siguradong buhay mo kaagad ang kapalit. we stayed in our house. i prayed nalang talaga na bumaba ang baha at pagsapit ng 2:37am ng nov.14, chineck ko yung pencil marks na ginawa ko ng 11pm sa dingding namin, bumaba pero almost 1 inch lang. (sobrang saya ko na dito kasi king ina at least bumaba na). tumuntong ako sa bubong ng sala namin na nasa bukana lang ng aming bintana, huminga ng malalim at napatulala sa mga bituin. sobrang dilim at tahimik ng paligid, ang tanging naririnig ko lamang ay mga tunog ng palaka. maya-maya, parang may mga naririnig akong mga boses ng tao at finocus ko ang pandinig sa mga iyon disregarding ang mga palaka, and wtf, ang naririnig ko na sinasabi ng mga tao ay ""rescue"" at ""tulong"" echoing all over our barangay in all directions. sobrang hina lamang ng naririnig ko dahil sa kalayuan ng mga taong sumisigaw. (kung napakinggan niyo yung 17sec clip ng mga tao sa social media na sumisigaw ng ""rescue"", yes that's all true. pero imagine hearing it personally from 3am to 4:30am, wala na talaga akong magagawa kundi ipagdasal na sana maabot na ng rescuers ang aking mga ka-barangay.) ako'y napraning at chineck ulit ang tubig ng 4:30am, bumaba pa ito ng 1 inch. i was so happy na sa span ng 5 hrs, bumaba ang tubig ng 2 inches. yes. 2. freaking. inches. my goodness! as of now, patuloy nang humuhupa ang baha. mababaw na ang tubig, hanggang dibdib na lamang sa labas ng bahay. i mean, may kalaliman parin pero kumpara nung peak ng baha, lagpas pa siguro kahit iangat ko ang aking kamay. approx 6-7ft (i'm 5'7 btw, alam ko to kasi bumili ako ng pagkain namin para dito sa bahay, hanggang leeg tas naka tip-toe ako sa tubig). note na sa zone 2 lamang po ito, sa ibang zones baka umabot ng 15-20ft. i'm writing this at 9pm of november 14, 2020(will probably post it late bc of signal issues), naghihintay ng mga ipamimigay na tubig-inumin dahil trapped parin po kami sa baha. gustuhin ko mang maging bridge of all donations for us here sa flooded area pero trapped parin po kami sa baha at kami rin po mismo ay nangangailangan ng tulong. i excluded all political aspects, didn't dig deep sa mga issues like ""nasaan si mayor"" issue, ""okay lang ang cagayan"" issue by governor, and kilala niyo na kung sinong tinutukoy kong gustong lumangoy. vp leni, u da real mvp being the 1st one to respond to our calls from the national politicians. (alam kong may kanya kanya tayong manok pero sana hindi tayo magbulag-bulagan) #2022 sobrang nakakatakot ang rumaragasang tubig ng baha, sana lagi po tayong mag-iingat. nakalimutan na po ng mga tao ang social distancing dahil hand in hand po kaming nakikipag-sapalaran at nakikipag-laban para sa buhay laban sa bahang ito. ito ang aking mga karanasan sa baha, pasensya kung may mali man kayong makita at mabasa. please pray for us. kapit lang. babangon ulit tayo. maraming salamat sa lahat ng tumulong, tumutulong at tutulong pa lalo na sa mga rescuers natin. this is the worst flood i've ever had. please be safe! #cagayanvalleyneedshelp #bangoncagayanvalley",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ju3w8l/my_experience_in_tuguegarao_city_flooding_long/,14 11 2020
My first encounter with our criminal justice system,"imporant note - i would change some details as to protect the identity of those involved. ngyari to about feb 2020, before yung covid hard lockdown. kakagaling ko lang sa tindahan at pasakay na sa kotse ko. may isang kotseng maliit na naka harang sa drive way. di ako maka alis or yung mga asa harap niya. di ko pinansin at sumakay na sa kotse ko. mamaya maya may mga taong pumunta doon sa kotse para kausapin siya dahil wala nga namang makadaan dahil naka harang siya. tumagal siguro ng 10 minutes yung usapan pero nag mamatigas yung driver nung maliit na kotse. medyo napipikon na din ako so bumaba na din ako sa sasakyan at lumapit. mamaya maya bumaba na yung tao doon sa maliti na kotse at sinuntok yung mga nakikiusap sa kanila. syempre gaganti yung nasuntok, pero naawat naman namin sila ng mga nanonood sa eksena. after a while dumating yung mga tanod and napaalis na yung nakaharang na kotse. umalis na rin ako dahil maliit na bagay lang naman yun. fast forward to about aug 2020. naka tangap ako ng tawag doon sa suki ko (kung saan ako bumili). store owner: c, naalala mo yung away last time nung bumili ka dito? me: oo, store owner: nagkademandahan sila, and tinatanong ako nung isang partido kung willing kang tumistigo. me: store owner, maliit na bagay lang yan hayaan mo na sila. malaking abala lang yan store owner: attempted homicide yung kaso, makukulong yung isang panig and right there, di ako mapakapaniwala na attempted homicide na pala yung nakita ko. natawa na lang din ako sa totoo lang. ewan ko din, pero for some reason. inalis ko yung sd card nung dash cam ko at pinalitan ng blanko. siguro as precaution dahil baka madamay ako. isa din kasi ako sa umawat. pero yun nga, di pa rin ako pumayag na tumestigo sa away nila dahil maliit lang naman yun. about october naka tangap ulit ako ng tawag mula sa store owner. dahil umakyat na daw yung kaso sa korte and pupuntahan niya daw ako para kausapin. kasama yung isang side. di ako pumayag. later that night tumawag sakin yung anak nung isang side umiiyak asking me na pakingan lang sila. so ayun pumayag na din ako. so ayon doon sa isinampang kaso nung humarang sa daan, attempted homicide daw ang ngyari dahil may kutsilyo daw yung kabilang partido at sinubukan siyang saksakin. yung mga evidence niya are: 1. medico legal - at doon sa medicolegal may mga hiwa nga siya ng kutsilyo. sa belly sa collar bone. pero light scratches lang lahat 2. eye witness - 5 sila at sinusuportahan nila yung kwento nung kotseng humarang 3. police report - sinusuportahan din nito yung kwento nung nagdemanda at ng tatlong witness 4. photos and mga hiwa at galos niya so noon nakita ko to, di ako makapaniwala sa totoo lang. dahil ganun lang pala kabilis mag fabricate ng isang krimen. at makukulong yung isang tao dahil may isang taong gagamitin yung batas para makapag higanti. pumayag din ako sa huli na maging witness. tatlo lang kaming witness nung inaakusahan. ako, yung store owner, at isang trike driver (4 kung sasali yung inaakusahan). pero ang pinaka mabigat naming evidence yung dash cam recording ko. ang tagal din nung hearing. and ako mismo 2 times ako sumalang sa korte. nakaka drain sa totoo lang, dahil ang tagal ng ngyari noon tapos paikot ikot yung tanong para bang iniintay ka nilang magkamali. syempre di na rin naman fresh from memory ito by febuary lumabas na yung decision ang yun nga acquited yung pinagbintangan. nag sampa din ng counter charge yung nademanda. perjury at malicious prosecution. again i agree na tumestigo, dahil natakot na din ako na ang bilis lang palang kalikutin ng justice system natin. yung dinedemanda at large pa din hangang ngayon. dahil nung lumabas na yung charges sa kanya nagtago na siya. &#x200b; about doon sa humarang sa daan. 25 years old lang siya. apparently isa doon sa witness is nag aaral ng law, at tinuruan siya kung ano ang gagawin. (wtf sa totoo lang!) yung nagturo sa kanya is wala pang prior experience sa legal system natin. kungbaga text book lang lahat. nag agree yung 4 out of 5 na tumestigo laban sa kaibigan nila in exchange na idrodrop ang charges laban sa kanila. yung 1 pa, hindi na rin mahagilap. so base doon sa kwento nung mga witness is, self inflicted nga yung mga galos niya. wtf sobra. and na buo lang nila tong plano nung nag iinuman sila. birobiroan lang daw sa totoo. ang plano nila sa totoo lang was tatakutin ng demanda yung kabilang panig. and once makipag settle hahatiin nila yung pera. hihingi daw sila ng 5m as settlement at paghahatian. ang hindi nila alam was lalaban din yung dinemanda nila. ang original plan lang pala was hangang prosecutor lang dapat. kaso yun nga umakyat daw yung demanda.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ofc3mn/my_first_encounter_with_our_criminal_justice/,7 07 2021
"alex, tanghaling tapat ng sabado, 2021","(any review for this is very-very much appreciated. i'm an aspiring writer po and i just launched a passion project anthology, isa po ito sa mga kwento) &#x200b; **chairman** ngayon ko lang naranasan ‘to sa tagal ko nang nanunungkulan sa barangay. isama mo na sa mga karanasang ‘yon ang lahat ng away mag-asawa, suntukan ng mga lasing, at mga batang ginagahasa sa bukiran. pero eto… ngayon ko lang napansin na buong araw ko na palang hinihimas ang rosaryong nakasabit sa leeg ko. maya’t-maya ko pa hinahalikan at binubulungan na sana’y wag mangyari sa pamilya ko ang nakita ko kanina. naririnig ko pa rin ang sigaw ni cecil, kumare’t-kapitbahay namin, tanghaling tapat ng sabado, kung saan ang tanghalian sa buong kalsada nami’y naantala dahil sa kanyang nakakakilabot na sigaw. sa ilalim ng nagbabagang init ay nagsitakbuhan kami upang sumaklolo. kinailangan ko pang iwanan ang tinola ni misis at ang isang basong softdrinks na nilalanguyan pa dalawang yelo nang ako’y tumakbo papunta sa bahay ni cecil. ngayo’y hindi pa rin ako kumakain. sa totoo nga’y hindi pa ako nakakaranas ng gutom. hindi ko pa ata kaya. sa bahay ni cecil ay dinatnan namin ang katawan ng panganay ni cecil na si joe na nakaratay sa braso ng kanyang bunsong kapatid na si alex, sa sahig ng kanilang sala. sa leeg ni joe ay nakabaon ang basag na bote na ginamit ni alex na balot na balot sa dugo ng kanyang kapatid. agad ang kapit at halik ko sa aking rosaryo nang makita ko ang imahe; na parang sinaunang obra na naglalahad ng malagim na kwento. pero ano ang kwento neto? hanggang ngayon ay wala pa rin kaming ideya kung bakit. magmula sa pagsigaw ni cecil ng, “anong nangyari?! anak, anong nangyari?!” sa tulalang alex na nakatitig sa dilat na mga mata ni joe, hanggang sa pagpunta namin dito sa aking opisina sa barangay, ay wala pa rin kaming makuhang rason mula sa bakit. sa isang maliit na kwarto sa aking opisina’y pinaupo ko muna si alex. tulala at sinusubukang burahin ang dugo sa kanyang mukha gamit ang duguan ring damit n’ya. hinainan ko ng isang bote ng softdrinks at tatlong pandesal mula pa sa agahan namin kanina si alex, na agad namang n’yang kinain ng walang pag-aalinlangan. dito na nagsimulang gumapang ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod. isang kilabot na hindi ko maipaliwanag, habang pinapanood ko si alex na walang awat sa pagkain, habang ako’y hindi ko pa rin magawang matakam sa masarap na lutong nag-aabang sa’kin sa bahay. “alex,” marahan kong sinabi. “ba’t mo ginawa ‘yun?” tumingin lamang sa’kin si alex, patay na mga mata, bibig na mabagal ang nguya. at sa kanyang paglunok ay walang mga salitang bumalik sa’kin. hindi ko alam kung bakit pero bigla kong naalala si jefferson, isang tricycle driver dito sa’min. dalawang taon na ang nakakalipas nang mapatay n’ya ang isang dayo na nakaaway n’ya sa kalsada. nangyari ‘to nang kamuntikan n’yang makasalpukan ang sasakyan ng dayo, at nang nahinto silang dalawa’y nagkasagutan muna sila bago mapikon si jefferson. hinampas n’ya ng bakal na tubo ang dayo. hindi na raw n’ya napigilan dahil sa mga mapanglait na mga salitang tinawag sa kanya. bobo, unggoy, uling, mababa. labing-isang beses paulit-ulit na hinampas ni jefferson sa ulo ang dayo, at sa sobrang lakas ng bawat hampas ay may parte na ng utak na lumabas dito. sa prisinto’y naalala ko si jefferson, iyak nang iyak at humihingi ng tawad dahil sa nangyari. hindi makakain, hindi rin makatulog. nilamon na s’ya ng konsensya n’ya, at ang konsensya n’ya ang tumulak sa kanya na agawin ang baril ng isa sa mga pulis na nagbabantay, at iputok sa kanyang sariling ulo. nasaktan si jefferson, nagalit, at di nakapagpigil. naintindihan ko ang kwento ‘nun. pero bakit hindi ko maintindihan ‘to? alam kong magkasundo ang magkapatid na ‘to. alam ko kung ga’no sila kalapit sa isa’t-isa. kaya pa’no nangyari ‘to? ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod ay gumagapang paakyat hanggang sa aking dibdib, tila ba kumakapit ng mahigpit. pasikip nang pasikip at medyo nahihirapan akong huminga. ang kakaibang pakiramdam na ‘to’y tumitindi habang nanatiling tahimik at nakatitig lamang sa’kin si alex. biglang iniabot ni alex ang kanyang kamay at dito tumalon na ang puso ko. napaatras ako sa aking kinauupuan, at mabilisan kong hinugot ang aking rosaryo mula sa pagkakatago nito sa aking damit. itinutok ko ito kay alex, na walang ibang kibo kun’di ang kunin ang bote ng softdrinks na nasa harapan n’ya. mas bumilis pa ang pagkatok sa aking dibdib, na para bang kamuntikan na kong mamatay. habang si alex nama’y pinapanood lang ako habang patuloy ang kanyang pag-inom. wala nga ata talagang mangyayari, at nang maramdaman ko kung gaano katahimik ang kwarto’y kumalma na ako. bakit sa dulo ng utak ko’y hinihiling ko na may sapi o di kaya’y isang demonyo talaga ang kaharap ko, at sa presensya ng aking rosaryo’y masasaktan s’ya. kahit anong kakaiba. kahit ano basta magkaroon lang ng eksplenasyon ang nangyari. pero siguro’y kakaiba na rin ang ikinikilos ng bata. at siguro nga’y mas dapat talaga akong matakot sa buhay kaysa sa patay. **cecil** “saan ba ko nagkulang?” tanong ni aling cecil sa mga kumare n’yang nakapalibot sa kanya sa masikip na opisina ni chairmain. napapaligiran din s’ya ng makukulay na mga pamaypay na hindi sabay-sabay ang pagaspas sa harap n’ya; nilulunod si aling cecil sa hangin. ang kanyang mukha nama’y tila ba isang rebulto ng santo kung punas-punasan ng mga panyo. “hindi ko pa rin maintindihan,” dugtong n’ya. “hindi naman ako nagkulang sa aruga. pareho ko namang pinapakita sa kanila na pantay ang pagmamahal ko sa kanila.” tuyo na ang mga mata ni aling cecil, ngunit tila ba hindi pa rin tapos ang kanyang pag-iyak. “hindi sila nag-aaway. hindi ko man lang narinig na nagtalo silang dalawa. o kung may pagtatalo man, malamang sa malamang maliit na bagay lang ‘yun. hindi yung ikakamatay mo!” isang labi ng lumapit sa tenga ni aling cecil, “alam mo tingin ko, baka inggit ‘yan. kasi si joe lang may trabaho sa kanilang dalawa, di ba? tapos si alex, wala pa rin sa kolehiyo. nag-aaral pa rin. sigurado akong ‘yun ang dahilan.” isa pang labi ang lumapit sa kabilang tenga naman ni aling cecil, “baka napikon na. kasi di ba halos s’ya na sa lahat ng gawaing bahay? baka pakiramdam n’ya porke’t mas malaki ambag ng kapatid n’ya , alila na s’ya neto.” isang labi naman na kaharap ni aling cecil ang nagsabing, “baka nagbabait-baitan lang kasi nga si joe ang halos sumasalo sa mga bayarin, pati sa pag-aaral n’ya. pero galit talaga s’ya, kasi baka naman may pagkakataong mas nabibigyang-atensyon si joe kahit hindi n’yo napapansin. kasi halimbawa uuwi s’yang pagod galing sa trabaho, syempre di n’yo maiwasang alagaan, pagsilbihan.” sa gitna ng mga labing ito’y si aling cecil, at ang ideyang unti-unting nabubuo dahil sa mga sinasabi ng mga labi sa kanya. “siguro,” sabi n’ya. “siguro nga.” **abbie** ang pangalan n’ya’y abbie. social worker daw s’ya. pagpasok n’ya’y agad bumungad sa’kin ang asul na bra sa ilalim ng dilaw na blouse nang tapatan ito ng liwanag mula sa bintanang katabi ko. sa kanyang pagtali ng buhok ay nakita kong basang-basa na ang kanyang kili-kili at kumikinang na sa pawis ang kanyang leeg. “alex?” sabi n’ya habang maya’t-mayang tinutulak ng kanyang daliri ang salamin n’yang dumudulas sa kanyang matangos na ilong. “bakit di mo ikwento muna sa’kin ang nangyari bago tayo umalis dito?” pasensya ka na, abbie. hindi ko nagawang sabihin kay chairman, na kilala pa mandin namin. hinding-hindi ko rin masasabi sa’yo. walang ibang maglalahad ng nangyari kun’di ang mga taong nais magbigay kahulugan dito, kasi kung ako tatanungin kung bakit, sa totoo lang, hindi ko rin alam ang isasagot. may nabasag akong bote sa kusina kanina, at sa pagpulot ko nito’y pumasok sa isip ko ang isang udyok. yung tipo ng udyok kapag nasa mataas kang lugar, at bigla mo na lang gustong itulak ang kasama mo. pero alam mong hindi ito dapat gawin, at kakapit ka pa nang mas mahigpit sa kanila para masiguro mong hindi ito mangyayari. ang udyok na ito’y nagsabi sa’kin na isaksak ko kay kuya ang basag na bote. at nalaman ko na lang na totoo na pala ang lahat nang dumapo sa aking balat ang mainit na dugo ni kuya. nahinto lang ako nang maramdaman ko ang buto sa leeg n’ya at nang marinig kong nabibilaukan na s’ya sa kanyang sariling dugo. hindi ko pa rin alam kung bakit. sana, tulad ng iniisip ni chairman, ay nasapian na nga lang ako. pero nakita ko ang lahat, andun ako. hindi ko lang alam na totoo pala ang lahat. namatay si kuya joe sa wala. at hindi ko matanggap na wala. normal lang sana ang sabado namin. tahimik. nanonood lang si kuya ng tv, naglilinis ako sa kusina. si nanay nama’y namamalengke ng pananghalian namin. bicol express daw ang lulutuin n’ya. puta, sinira ko ang araw. gusto kong umiyak dahil hindi na kami babalik sa salo-salo namin. “alex?” muling tawag ni abbie. “gusto kong malaman kung bakit. tayong dalawa lang. kaibigan mo ko dito. hinding-hindi ko ‘to sasabihin sa nanay mo, sa mga kapitbahay n’yo. may mga naririnig ako sa labas na dahil daw sa inggit? totoo ba ‘to? sa inggit nga? magmula nang dinala ako ni chairman dito sa maliit na kwartong ito’y napagpasyahan kong manahimik na lang sa nangyari. sa ngayo’y nilalabanan ko ang mga luha, nilalabanan ko ang panginginig ng aking bibig, at ang mga salitang gustong lumabas mula sa’kin. dapat mukhang hindi ko pinagsisisihan. dapat mukha akong galit. para naman mabigyang halaga, mabigyan ng ibig-sabihin ang pagkamatay ni kuya joe. dapat tinatatak ko sa utak ko na dapat lang! dapat lang sa kanya ang nangyari. dapat hindi ako bibigay. dahil kapag natalo ako, mamatay talaga sa wala si kuya. “sige, kung ayaw mong magkwento, ako muna. kasi naalala ko ‘tong isang batang babae at ang tatay n’yang abusado. tatay n’yang lasinggero. tatay n’yang isang beses s’yang hinipuan sa kanyang sariling kwarto at pinilit. ampon ang batang ‘yon, at tatay-tatayan n’ya lang etong umaabuso sa kanya. takot na takot ang bata dahil pakiramdam n’ya isang gabi’y papatayin na lang s’ya bigla neto. kaya naman isang gabi, nang bigla s’yang pinuntahan ng kanyang tatay upang pagsamantalahan ulit, sinasaksak ito ng bata gamit ang lapis sa mata, sa leeg, at sa dibdib.” kumuha ng panyo si abbie. sa kanyang paggalaw ay muling sumisilip ang kanyang bra sa likod ng blouse na parang mga batang naglalaro sa likod ng kurtina. “masarap sa pakiramdam, pero pumapatay pa rin s’ya ng tao. ilan taon n’yang dinibdib ‘yun. hanggang ngayon nararamdaman pa rin n’ya ang mga kamay ng tatay n’ya sa kanyang ari. sa kanyang dibdib. ilang taon bago n’ya matanggap ang ginawa n’ya. ngayon, medyo mahirap pa ring ikwento, pero kahit papaano’y kaya ko na. nangyari na kasi.” para bang may sumuntok sa aking dibdib nang marinig ko ‘to. bigla kong tinanggal ang aking paningin sa kanyang bra, at sa paggalaw ng aking mga mata’y bigla kong naramdaman ang pamumuo ng mga luha. “ayos lang, alex. pero andito lang ako. aalagaan ka muna namin. tapos pag handa ka na, makikinig ako. kahit pakonte-konte pa, ayos lang. aantayin kong mabuo ang kwento mo.” bumibilis bigla ang tibok ng puso ko. lalong nanginginig ang aking labi. at biglang pumasok si kuya sa isip ko, tumatakbo papalayo sa akin. mga bata pa kami, at hinahabol ko s’ya. “alex?” kuya wag kang lumayo! “alex?” kuya dito ka lang! kailangan kita dito! “sige, ayusin na natin pag-alis mo.” at parang isang batang nadapa sa semento, dito na walang awat na tumulo ang luha sa aking mga mata. “alex?” “hindi ko rin alam… hindi… ko rin alam. sorry, kuya! sorry! hindi ko rin alam kung bakit! patayin n’yo na lang ako! hindi ko alam anong nangyari! hindi ko na kaya!” lumalabo na ang aking paningin, pero kahit ga’no kalabo ang aking mga mata’y kitang-kita ko ang gulat at takot sa mukha ni abbie. pasensya ka na, kuya.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/nlygsa/alex_tanghaling_tapat_ng_sabado_2021/,27 05 2021
Singsing,"mapait akong napangiti nang mapansin ko ang dalawang magkasintahan sa aking harapan. kitang kita ko ang saya sa mga mata ng babae at kung gaano kasincere ang lalaki kung tumingin sa kanya. napatikhim ako at nag-iwas ng tingin ng maramdam kong humapdi ang aking mga mata. dahil ibig ibig ko nang maiyak ng magbalik sa aking ala-ala ang nakaraan. \~ ""mailene!"" saway sa'kin ni ron nang nakawan ko siya ng halik sa kanyang pisngi. masaya kaming nagkakantahan at nagkekwentuhan sa loob ng kanyang sasakyan. binabaybay ang daan patungo sa batangas. ""what? ayaw mo ba na halikan kita?"" nakalabi kong tugon rito at nagcross arms sa kanya. sumilay ang kanyang matatamis na ngiti at kinuha ang aking kaliwang kamay kahit nagmamaneho siya. ""of course not!"" mabilis na sagot nito at saka dinugtong ""gustong gusto kong hinahalikan mo ako, gustong gusto ko yang labi mo kaya dapat kapag hahalikan mo ako yung siguradong nakaharap ako sayo ha?"" idiniin niya ang haplos sa aking palad at hinalikan ang likod nito. namula ako sa kanyang sinabi at tumango. huminto siya saglit sa pagmamaneho at hinatak niya ako palapit sa kanya at masuyong hinalikan ang aking labi. \~ napahugot ako ng malalim na hininga ng maalala ko ang mukha ni ron. napatingin ako sa singsing kong suot at di ko namalayan na basa na pala ang aking mga pisngi dahil sa luha. tumingin ako muli sa magkasintahan sa aking harapan at napangiti sa kanila. sana'y magtagal ang kanilang relasyon. hinatak ko na ang tali ng jeep at agad pumara ng makita ko na nandito na pala ako sa aking bababaan. sinuyod ko ng tingin ang pet shop at tumingin ulit sa aking cellphone upang tingnan ang message na kakatanggap ko lang. ""wait a bit. bumili lang ng ice cream"" napailing ako at napangiti ng malapad ng makita ang isang batang napakaganda sa di kalayuan. ""mom!"" sigaw ni ruine ng makita niya ako dahilan upang mapangiti ako. ""hi baby. how's your day?"" tanong ko at humalik ako sa kanyang pisngi at inayos ang kanyang tali sa buhok. ""super duper good, mom!"" may tumikhim sa'king likuran kaya lumingon ako rito ""ooohhh and tito alex bought me a rabbit"" napabagsak ang tingin ko sa cage na hawak ni alex at nakita ang isang kulay brown na rabbit. ""alex naman."" nakanguso kong tawag dito. he smirked at me at ginulo ang aking buhok. ""ron will be happy, mailene. gusto niya makitang masaya kayo ng anak mo."" sumikip ang dibdib ko sa kanyang sinabi. pinisil niya ang aking pisngi at inabot sakin ang cage upang mabuhat si ruine. alex is ron's bestfriend. siya ang naging father figure ni ruine. siya ang kasama ko noong nanganak ako, siya ang kasama ko ng unang beses magsalita ang anak ko ng ""mama"", siya ang kasama ko noong sinugod ko sa hospital si ruine ng lagnatin ito. si alex ang nagbantay sa amin ni ruine. kahit kailan ay hindi siya umalis sa tabi ko. itinaas ko ang cage na aking hawak at kinausap ang rabbit sa loob nito. ""katulad mo ako, nakakulong ka sa cage at nakakulong ako sa nakaraan."" napakagat labi ako ng marinig ko ang hagikgik ni ruine, napatingin ako sa likuran ni alex at buhat buhat niya ang aking anak. kitang kita ang saya ni ruine sa kanyang tito alex. humalik ito sa pisngi ng kanyang tito at ngumiti muli. sumunod na ako sa sasakyan ni alex, pinaupo niya ako sa passenger seat at inayos niya ang uupuan ni ruine sa likod katabi ang rabbit nito. sumakay na si alex at pinaandar ang sasakyan. nagulat ako ng kunin niya ang aking kamay kaya binawi ko ito sa kanya. ""pasensya na mai"" ngiting malungkot sakin ni alex ngunit di na ako tumugon. tumingin ako sa labas ng bintana habang dinarama ko ang singsing sa aking palasingsingan. \~ ""i promise, ikaw at ikaw lang sa buhay ko mailene."" pangako ni ron sa akin at isinuot sa akin ang singsing na napili niya. ""di pa nga ako nagsasabi ng yes eh!"" maktol ko rito pero nangingiti dahil parang sasabog ang puso ko. ""mahal, di mo man sabihin. alam ko, ramdam ko. pero magtatanong na lang ako ulit ha?"" napakagat ako ng labi ng pumunta siya sa aking likuran. papalubog na ang araw, nakatanaw sa karagatan. nagulat ako ng may naramdaman akong malamig sa aking leeg kasabay ng pagpatak ng luha ko ng may mga lobong paangat at nakasabit rito ang mga salitang... ""will you marry me, mailene?"" ikinabit niya sa leeg ko ang kwintas at iniharap niya ako sa kanya.

Tagalized - Morgue.,"may nakita akong isang ad sa dyaryo, hindi man ako maka-paniwala at kinilabutan pero nakaka-anyaya ang sinasabi. ""gusto mo bang kumita ng 1000 pesos per night bilang security sa morge? apply na!"" medyo matagal na rin akong walang trabaho at makaka-bayad na rin ako ng upa at makapa-mamumuhay ng maginhawa kung magkataon. kaya naman nag-apply ako kahit medyo nag-dalawang-isip, inaasahan ko nang hindi ako makaka-kuha ng kahit anong sagot mula sa kumpanya. pero wala pang dalawang oras ay may natanggap akong email mula sa employer: ""maraming salamat sa ipinasa mong application form para sa posisyong night guard sa morge. masaya kong ibinabalita na ang mga skills na iyong binanggit ay tugma para sa hinahanap namin sa isang guard at gusto kitang offeran ng isang taong kontrata. kung ika'y sumasang-ayon sa mga kasunduan sa ibaba, maari lamang mag-iwan ka ng signature online via e-signature na naka-lista sa baba at pumunta ka sa (redacted) eksakto alas diyes ngayong gabi. makaka-tanggap ka ng 5000 linggo-linggo na direkta sa iyong bangko."" ngayong gabi? hindi ba masaydong mabilis ang mga pangyayari? pero hindi na ako nag-reklamo o tanong pa. hindi ko alam kung anong aasahan o kung sino ang madadatnan ko doon, kaya sinuot ko na 'yung damit at pantalon ko at agad nagtungo sa nasabing address nang mas maaga sa itinakdang oras. nandoon na ako ng mga alas nwebe kwarenta 'y singko ng gabi at may isang middle aged na lalaki na mukhang nag-tatrabaho sa morge ang bumati sa akin. ""hi, michael, tama? ako nga pala si james."" - doon ay nag-kamayan kami at nag-kangitian - ""alam ko na pinapunta ka dito sa kabila ng maikling abiso, pero sadyang nanganga-ilangan ng bagong gwardiya ang kumpanya na nag-hire sa atin dito agad-agad para ngayong gabi.""

""ok. ano naman ang mga trabaho ko dito..."" pagsisimula ko. ""ahh, 'yun. wala naman gaano, siguraduhin mo lang na walang makakapasok."" - lumapit s'ya sa akin at sinabing - ""o labas."" isang maikling katahimikan at nagtinginan kaming dalawa, doon ay napa-ngiti ito at ang sabi: ""de, joke lang. so ayun, tapos na 'yung shift ko, kaya naman mauuna na ako. basta doon ka lang sa office at mag-relax hanggang alas sais ng umaga. doon darating na 'yung kahalili mo."" at doon nga ay umalis na s'ya. umupo ako sa upuan sa may office. akala ko siguro naman walang hindi magandang mangyayari. may papel sa harap ko at habang tinitignan ko ito ay doon ko lang napagtanto na ito ay listahan ng mga rules na specifically naka-asign sa akin. ito ang sabi: sa bagong gwardiya. welcome to the company. sa baba ay ang listahan ng mga rules para sa iyong trabaho: 1. ang una mong dapat gawin ay ang mag-conduct ng full sweep sa buong area para siguraduhin na walang kakaibang mga nangyayari liban sa ordinary (pati sa crypt). important note: kung may katawan man na naka-labas sa chambers sa loob ng crypt, itulak mo lamang ito pabalik. dapat manatili silang nasa-loob sa lahat ng pagkakataon. 2. matapos ang buong sweep, maari ka nang manatili sa loob ng office hanggang matapos ang shift mo. may iba pang mga rules na naka-lista sa baba, pero nag-desisyon akong libutin muna ang buong lugar. medyo may kaliitan ang morge, may isang malaking medical room na halos mapuno ng medical supplies ang loob. pero may sapat na espasyo para sa 2-3 lamesa na puwedeng pag-lagyan ng mga labi. sa loob ng crypt ay may palikuran. nag-desisyon akong unahin na ang pinaka-ayaw kong lugar - 'yung crypt. umalis na ako sa office at binuksan ang solid at napaka-bigat na pinto ng crypt, agad-agad ay sinalubong ako ng napaka-lamig na hangin. sa loob, may dalawang katawan sa gitna ng kwarto at mga chambers sa pader. lahat naman sila ay sarado kaya naman mabilis akong lumabas ng kwarto. habang pabalik ako mula sa bathroom, may nakita akong lalaki na naka lab coat na naka-tayo sa gitna ng medical room. parang may kinakalikot gamit ang mga medical tools malapit sa isang body bag. ""tang... tinakot mo naman ako boss."" - sabi ko. tinignan n'ya ako na parang wala lang at bumalik sa ginagawa nito. ""akala ko umuwi na ang lahat. ako nga pala si michael, bagong gwardiya."" - sabi ko, gaya ng nauna, hindi n'ya ako pinansin. kumaway na ako at umalis pabalik ng office. babasahin ko na sana ulit ang mga rules ng biglang may matinis na tunog akong narinig na para bang may bakal na kumi-kiskis sa isa pang bakal na nag-eecho sa buong building. medyo mahina na ito at parang nang-gagaling sa mga tubo. tumagal din iyon ng ilang segundo at huminto sa kaparehas na segundo. hindi ko na lang pinansin at i-idlip na lang, check ng cell phone. pero medyo tumatagal na ang tunog at habang mas kinikilabutan ako ay unti-unti nang nagbabago ang kanina'y parang bakal na kumi-kiskis sa isa't-isa ay naging... ungol. lumabas ako ng office at tatanungin ko sana 'yung kaninang naka lab coat pero mukhang naka-uwi na s'ya sa mga oras na 'yun. hindi ako sigurado kung saan mismo nang-gagaling ang tunog, pero parang sa may crypt, kaya naman pinuntahan ko ito. 'yung oras na binuksan ko ang pinto ay ang buong building ay nanahimik. huminga ako ng malalim at napansin ko na 'yung isang chambers ay naka-bukas na ng bahagya. tinulak ko ito pabalik at agad-agad na bumalik sa office. nawala na ng tuluyan ang matinis na na para bang ungol na iyon. nagpatuloy ako sa pagbabasa: 3. maari kang matulog sa office, pero dapat handa ka sa mga mangyayari. sleep at your own risk, ika nga nila. matapos nun ay isang napaka-lakas na tunog ang halos mag-patalon sa buong pagkatao ko. ""tulong! palabasin n'yo ako dito!"" - ang boses ay tila nang-gagaling sa mga tubo. tumayo ako habang sobra ang kalabog ng dibdib ko. ""palabasin n'yo ako, hindi ako maka-hinga!"" - paulit-ulit na pagmama-kaawa ng boses na ngayon ay may kasama ng kalabog. binuksan ko ang pintuan ng office at sa hindi malaman na dahilan sa crypt nang-gagaling ang boses. nanginginig, pero binuksan ko ang pinto. ""buhay pa ako, isa itong pagkakamali! tulong!"" - mas lalong lumakas ang boses nung oras na buksan ko ang napaka-bigat at solidong pinto. ""asan ka?!"" - nanginginig akong tumingin sa paligid, habang ang walang humpay na tumatawag ang boses na may kasamang malalakas na kalabog. lumapit ako at unti-unting inilapit ang tenga para maka-siguro na ang bubuksan ko ay ang tamang chamber. ""buhay pa ako! utang na loob! ple----"" ang boses at ang mga kalabog ay daglian na lamang nawala nang biglaan kong binuksan ang isa sa mga chambers at sinalubong ako ng malamig na bangkay ng isang middle-aged na lalaki. tumayo lang ako doon, nakatitig sa bangkay, halos tumigil sa pagtakbo ang isip ko sa kung ano ang mga nangyayari. malinaw na malinaw kong narinig at naramdaman ko ang bawat kalabog nung oras na hinawakan ko ang hawakan ng chamber at para bang may kung sino man na bigla-bigla na lang nagpatigil nito. pinaglalaruan lang ba ako ng aking isipan? tinulak ko ang chamber pabalik at mabilis na umalis doon, nilock ang pinto ng office. iniisip ko na ang pag-aaply sa trabahong 'to ay maaring isang malaking pagkakamali. pakiramdam ko na nababaliw na ako, pero agad ko ring kinumbinse ang sarili ko na nasa ulo ko lang lahat ng 'to. nagpatuloy ako sa pagbabasa ng mg rules: 4. puwede kang mag-patugtog para maibsan ang katahimikan basta't hindi ito makaka-kuha ng atensyon sa labas. 5. kung may marinig kang hindi mo maipaliwanag na ingay galing sa may crypt, 'wag mo na lamang ito pansinin. 6. kung ang mga ingay na 'yun ay naging sigaw ng pagpapanic, gawin ang mga sumusunod: • kung ang mga sigaw ay mula sa babae, 'wag mo pansinin hanggang sa tumigil ito. 'wag na 'wag kang papasok sa loob ng crypt sa mga oras na nangyayari ito sa kahit anong dahilan. • kung ang mga ingay ay mula sa lalaki, hanapin ang pinag-mumulan ng ingay at hatakin ang chamber. dapat huminto na ang ingay pagkatapos mong mabuksan ang chamber. doon na nagtatapos ang page. nilapag ko na ang papel at dahan-dahang inilapat ang likod ko sa upuan. ala una na noon at nag-sisimula na akong antukin. maya-maya pa ay nagsisimula ng pumikit ang aking mga mata ng kusa. nagsisimula na akong mahulog sa panaginip nang biglang may mahigpit akong hawak na naramdaman sa likod ng aking balikat. sa sobrang gulat ko ay agad-agad akong napatayo at sinipa ang upuan. walang tao o kahit ano noong mga oras na iyon. hindi na ako inaantok nung mga oras na 'yun. tahimik na ang buong kapaligiran noon at nagpunta ako sa palikuran. pagbalik ko ay alas tres na at halos handa na akong tapusin ang shift ko dito. napagisip-isip ko na hindi na rin masama para sa isang libo, hanggang tinalikod ko ang papel na may mga rules at napansin kong may naka-sulat pa sa likod: 7. lahat ng staff ay lalabas o dapat nasa labas na ng building bago mag alas diyes ng gabi, kaya kung may makita kang lalaki na naka lab coat during your shift, 'wag na 'wag sa kahit ano mang sitwasyon na subukan mong makipag-usap sa kanya. paulit-ulit-ulit kong binasa ang rule ng limang beses, pero wala pa ring nagbabago sa naka-sulat. may mahinang katok sa pinto ng office. tinignan ko ito at sa likod ng salamin ay nakita ko ang lalaking naka lab coat naka-ngiti sa akin. alas kwatro 'y media na at patuloy pa rin s'ya sa pagkatok. sa mga magta-tanong, hindi ko na ho alam kung saan ko ito nakuha dahil 2018 ko pa po ito tinagalog. nakita ko lang na naka-save pa rin sa note ng selpon ko. salamat and ang init. tangina.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/t8j464/tagalized_morgue/,7 03 2022
Tagalized Story.,"may story ako. ako lang ang nag-iisang babae sa pinag-tatrabahuhan kong kumpanya at alam ko na kung bakit. isa akong fresh graduate sa kolehiyo at gusto ko na talagang makapag-simula ng career agad-agad na walang kinalaman sa pagse-serve ng pagkain, pagpupunas ng mga gamit, o pag-dadala o timpla ng kape sa isang matandang negosyante. sa naka-sanayan nag-aapply ako sa trabaho na may anim na araw na trabaho at marami-rami na rin akong interview na napagdaanan. alam ko na ang tinapos kong hrm na kurso ay hindi gaanong makaka-kuha ng magandang oportunidad, pero naniniwala pa rin ako na may mas maganda pang trabaho na naghihintay sa akin. kaya naman nanatili akong positibo, matyaga, at nag-aapply lang sa mga office jobs na may magandang benipisyo. kahit halos wala na akong mapag-kunan ng makakain dahil sa magastos na mga interview, at least mapapag-tibay naman nito ang kakaunting pride na natitira sa akin. halos tatlong linggo na rin ang nakalipas, may isa akong phone interview sa isang internet security company. ang kumpanyang iyon ay maraming offices sa amin at naghahanap sila ng bagong customer support specialist para sa kanilang international department. ang mga requirements ay maganda o mahinahon na boses, good spoken and written grammar, kakaunting tech-knowledge, at may kakayahang mag-trabaho sa umaga at gabi. ang office ay dalawang sakay lang sa mula sa amin, at mayroon silang magandang offer sa health insurance. nag-aapply ako kahit lmitado lang din ang alam ko sa computer science. naging maayos naman ang phone interview at matapos ang dalawang meetings sa hr at sa management, binigyan nila ako ng isang napaka-gandang offer (kahit na wala pa talaga akong experience sa kahit anong trabaho). sa loob ng unang linggo ko, kailangan kong magtrabaho nang regular shift na 9-5 (am) para maging online ako kasabay ng manager ko, na nag-trabaho sa ibang branch ng kumpanya. pagkatapos noon ay kailangan kong magtrabaho para sa regular na schedule ko bilang support - ang schedule ko ay 6 na araw na pasok (09:00 am -05:00 pm (am) at may isang araw na night shift 09:00 pm - 05:00 am respectively). sa unang araw ko, ang suot ko ay isang loose na sweater at mahabang skirt. bilang sa kaalaman ko ay sa ganitong uri ng trabaho ay karamihan mga lalaki ang empleyado, ayaw ko naman mag-cause ng unnecessary attention dahil sa provocatively o inappropriately pag-susuot ng hindi naayon na attire. ang lalaki sa front desk ay mukha namang maayos na tao. pinakilala n'ya ang sarili n'ya bilang si andrew bago n'ya ako tulungang mag-fill out ng mga paperwork at sinamahan n'ya na ako sa aking mesa at sa isang open space na workspace. nakatitig lang ako sa tila walang katapusang mga desks habang naglalakad kami, napansin ko na halos hindi mo makikita ang mga mukha ng bawat taong nagta-trabaho na naka-upo sa bawat desks. wala man lang akong nakita o napansin na babae habang nag-lalakad kami sa tila baga'y walang katapusang workspace na iyon, na talaga namang hindi normal at nakaka-bahala. kahit ang kalmadong presensya ni andrew ay hindi kayang maiwaglit ang wari kakaibang pakiramdam na naka-tuon sa akin. halos maubusan ako ng hininga ng maramdaman ko ang mga presensya ng bagong kong co-workers na tila nagsasabi na ""hindi ka nababagay dito"". nagulat ako ng biglang huminto si andrew sa isang desk na napuno ng mga printed memes, floral stickers, at isang lumang keychain na naka-patong sa harap ng monitor. bukod pa doon ay natatakpan na rin ng makapal na alikabok ang keyboard, monitor at ang natitirang ispasyo ng desk. ""ahhh... anong nangyari..."" sabi ni andrew sa medyo upset na boses. ""pasensya ka na."" sabi nito habang nakatingin sa aking mga papeles. ""ah... aya. dapat matagal na 'tong nalinis. kailangan kong maka-usap ang custodian"". ""ok lang 'yun"", sagot ko. ""puwede ko namang punasan na lang 'yan, wala namang problema"". medyo asiwa na noon si andrew, pero habang ginagala ko ang aking paningin ay malinaw na wala ng ibang bakanteng desk maliban doon. mabilis na natapos ang araw na iyon. natutunan ko na ang mga dapat kung gawin na sumagot sa support related phone calls at gumawa ng bagong ticket para sa system. kailangan ko ring i-monitor ang lahat ng pumapasok na chats at written tickets at isaayos ito base sa level ng urgency at type nito. hindi naman ako required mag-bigay ng technical advice, pero dapat maging pamilyar ako sa aming product software. bilang wala pa namang mga tawag ay pinaki-alaman ko muna ang manual. halos wala akong maintindihan sa mga naroon kaya naman ginogle ko na lang ang karamihan na nasa manual. kinumusta ako noon ng manager ko at mukhang hindi s'ya masaya sa mga lapses ko sa mga materials. dahil pakiramdam ko wala akong matinong nagawa at gagawin sa mga oras na iyon ay panandalian akong nag-break para linisin ang mesa ko. tumayo ako para tanungin si andrew kung saan makaka-kuha ng basahan para sa mesa ko. agad-agad kong pinagsisihan ang desisyon kong iyon. ang bawat mata sa kwarto ay tila napako sa pagtayo ko sa aking kinauupuan. hindi ako sigurado pero maraming mga bulungan akong narinig habang papalayo ako sa aking mesa. ang kaninang maingay na mga keyboard ay pahina nang pahina na halos kainin na ako ng lupa sa sobrang hindi ko pagiging kumportable at self-conscious na rin at the same time. napansin ko na lang na halos halikan ko na ang dibdib ko sa pagyuko para lang hindi ako mapansin. bago ako maka-rating sa isang palikong daan patungo sa front desk ay buong-lakas kong tinignan ang isang tila walang hiyang lalaki na nakatitig sa akin. hindi ko alam kung ano ang inaasahan ko, pero 'yung overall appearance ng lalaking naka-hooding pang-asar na 'yun ay nagbigay ng matinding kilabot sa buong katawan ko. siguro mga ka-edad ko s'ya pero hindi man lang s'ya nahiya o natinag sa pagkaka-titig n'ya sa akin sa kabila ng pagtitig ko sa kanya na may halong pagka-bwisit at inis. isang kakila-kilabot na ngiti ang sumilaw sa mga labi nito habang naka-titig sa parteng bukong-bukong ng aking mga paa at dahan-dahan itong bumalik sa kanyang monitor. inisip ko kung anong magiging reaksyon n'ya kapag tinitigan ko rin ng kaparehong paraan ng pagtitig n'ya sa akin ang tinitigyawat n'yang leeg. parehong reaksyon pa rin ang nakuha ko habang naglalakad ako pabalik sa aking mesa kasama ang box ng computer wipes sa mga kamay ko. may maganda ring nangyari sa araw na iyon. habang nililinis ko ang mga drawer ng mesa ko ay may nakita akong half-used notebook mula sa nakaraang nagta-trabaho sa mesa ko. hindi n'ya nilagay ang first name n'ya, kundi initial lang at last name: j. espiritu. pero, base sa dekorasyon ng notebook, sigurado ako na babae rin s'ya kagaya ko. ang mga naiwan n'yang gamit ay nagbigay ng kapanatagan sa akin, pero 'yung notebook ang talagang pumukaw ng atensyon ko. doon ay sinabi nito ang pina-ikli at simpleng manual gamit ang easy-to-undertand terms at mga explenasyon sa nakaka-litong terminolohiya at komplikadong panuto sa manual. sa tulong n'ya ay nasurpresa ko ang aking manager sa aking product knowledge pagkatapos ng shift ko. matapos ang isang magandang araw ay buong tapang akong gumala sa office at nag-explore sa pantry. binenta ni andrew sa akin ang top-notch coffee machine at snacks sa nasabing pantry, tutal nagugutom na rin naman ako matapos ang isang emotionally, intellectually and productive na araw na 'yun. (ansabe). tsaka, medyo butas na rin 'yung bulsa at namumula na ang mga credit cards ko, kaya naman ayos na ako sa ilang pirasong masasarap na cookies. habang papalapit ako ay may narinig akong malakas na usapan at tawanan sa pantry. sa katangahan ko ay inisip ko na baka naman mas mainit, friendly o kahit maka-tao na sila sa akin. subalit ang maliit na pantry ay napuno ng katahimikan the moment na pumasok ako sa pantry. may limang lalaki doon na mag-kakaiba ang edad at lalaki na naka-upo sa palibot ng isang maliit na lamesa, at lahat sila ay naka-titig na direkta sa akin. ""panget na araw?"" - tugon ng isang pang-asar na boses. agad kong itinaas ang ulo ko mula sa pagkaka-titig sa sahig para hanapin ang pinag-mulan ng boses. hindi naging mahirap sa aking hanapin at malaman na mula iyon sa naka-hoodie na walang-hiyang tumitig sa akin nung nakaraan lang. ""siguro marami ka ng experience?"" - sambit pa nito sa nakaka-asar na tono at may-unting pag-taas ng kilay. ""para makakuha ng komportableng trabaho. siguro sikat ka?"". ""ano 'to, high-school?"" - sagot ko sa malakas na boses. hindi ko hilig kumompronta ng tao, pero sobra na 'to. hostility is one thing, social awkwardness is another, pero pakiramdam ko isa 'tong 80's na high-school drama na mga trenta anyos ang mga bida bilang mga teenagers. ""nandito lang ako para kumuha kape at kung may problema ka sa trabaho ko, puwede mong dalhin sa hr kung ano man ang issue mo"". nagpatuloy ako habang ine-enjoy ang namumutla at pahiyang mukha ng mga taong 'yun. mabuti naman, gusto kong maramdaman nila ang katiting na discomfort na buong araw kung kinakaharap. pinili kong lumayo sa aking mga co-workers, naglakad ako ng taas noo pabalik sa mesa ko na may hawak-hawak na tasa ng kape. bago pa ako maka-upo at enjoyin ang masarap na kape, napansin kong may isang mensahe galing sa hindi kilalang number: ""you have quite an attitude, don't you?"" nanigas ako habang hawak ang cell phone sa isa kong kamay at kape sa kabila. habang prino-proseso ko ang tila breach sa personal security ko, naka-tanggap ulit ako ng dalawa pang mensahe. isa ay ang hubo't-hubad kong katawan na sinend ko sa una kong serious college boyfriend. ang pangalawa: ""bakit hindi mo ngayon ibigay 'yang picture sa hr?"" sa totoo lang, sobrang naapektuhan ako sa invasion ng privacy ko. pumasok ang kahihiyan sa akin at sobrang naiinis ako for drawing so much unwanted attention sa sarili ko. kasalanan ko lahat 'to. pumasok ako sa isang office na puno ng ethical hackers na may pare-parehong pangalan ng aso bilang password. walang duda na ang litratong iyon ay umiikot na sa buong office at lahat ng iyon ay salamat sa walang hiyang ka-trabaho ko, at isa na akong kakatuwang tao sa loob ng office. hindi ko na ginalaw ang kape ko at umuwi na lang, habang pinipigilan ko ang bawat emosyon na bumuhos hanggang makarating ako sa safety ng bahay. halos hindi ako matigil sa kaiiyak nung gabing 'yun, iniisip ko na ang mga mukha ng mga ka-trabaho ko habang tigang na tigang na nakatitig sa hubad kong katawan. mga alas tres na ng madaling araw, doon ko lang na-realize na wala ng kwenta para pa magpaka-lunod ako sa kahihiyan. kailangan kong gumawa ng plano para maka-survive sa ganitong uri ng workplace. quitting is not an option kasi masyadong malaki ang pasweldo nila para tumigil ako. tsaka, halos tinapay na lang ang kaya kong bilhin sa araw-araw. ang pangalawa kong option ay pumunta sa hr, but there's no way i was going to open that can of worms. hindi ko mapapatunayan kong sino talaga ang nag-send ng mga mensahe na iyon. last option? stick with it, keep my head down, gawin ang trabaho na pinasukan ko at 'wag pansinin ang iba pang mga harassment na gagawin nila. 'yun nga ang ginawa ko. sa kabuuan ng isang linggong training ko ay pumapasok ako on time, hindi ako umaalis sa desk ko liban na lang kung pupunta sa palikuran. iniwasan ko rin ang kahit anong contact kanino man at pinanatili ko lang ang aking mga mata sa mga inanimate objects. salamat kay j. espiritu, palagi akong on top ng training ko. sa bawat bagong task na galing sa manager ko, laging may katumbas na entry sa kanyang notebook. wala ng nakaka-gagong texts at face-to-face na kumprontasyon, pero mayroong kakatuwang pakiramdam na panibagong sisira sa kalagayan ko. sa darating na biyernes na ang huling training ko, na nagdala sa akin sa huling entry sa notebook. night shift survival guide: - matulog sa buong umaga bago ang shift at 'wag na 'wag kang matutulog. - walang sino man ang dapat maka-pasok. - panatilihing may pepper spray na dala. (sa kahit anong sitwasyon). - i-check ang bawat aisle, meeting rooms. huwag kalimutang i-check ang ilalim ng lamesa, balkonahe, kitchen tables at kahit likod ng cooler. - laging mag-open ng skype na naka-ready sa emergency in case na hindi gumana ang mobile services. - panatilihing updated sa kaibigan/pamilya/lover kada oras. ang nasabing listahan ay medyo may kahulugan. una, sabi ng hr puwede naman akong matulog sa pagitan ng 2-5 am, basta malapit palagi sa akin ang office smartphone. mayroon nga silang pull out couch sa isang conference room para lang talaga sa ganitong sitwasyon. pangalawa, ang buong shift ay phone calls, kaya palaging may paraan para maka-tawag mula sa office phone, tama? lastly, ang mga naka-outlined sa ""guide"" ay parang o.a at paranoid. siguro 'yung listahan ay satirical? (ewan ko). siguro si espiritu parehas kami ng pakiramdam tungkol sa mga tila patay gutom na mga asong cold-blooded na co-workers? pero 'yung isip ko nag-tatrabaho ng sobra-sobra para makita ang logic sa likod ng mga pag-iingat na ito. may kakatuwa akong pakiramdam na may importanteng impormasyon akong hindi nalalaman. lahat 'yun iniisip ko habang paalis ako ng bahay nung biyernes na 'yun, last day ng training ko. ""andrew"", - dahan-dahan akong lumapit sa kanya. ""puwede ba mag-tanong?"" ""sure thing"", - sagot n'ya na may maaliwalas na ngiti sa kanyang mga labi. ""nagtataka lang ako, bakit wala akong nakikitang ibang support agents. i mean, 'di ba dapat merong at least lima pang tao para ma-cover 'yung six-day rotation cycle?"" ""kailangan mong tanungin ang manager mo tungkol d'yan. most likely naka-kalat sila sa iba pang branch sa syudad. normal lang naman 'yun sa ganoong kaso"", - sagot n'ya. pakiramdam ko tapos na kami sa diskusyon na 'yun matapos s'yang bumalik sa final tasks n'ya para sa linggong iyon. ""meron bang ibang agent na nag-trabaho dito liban sa akin?"" - pagpapatuloy ko, dahil ganun na lamang ang kagustuhan kong malaman ang iba pang detalye sa babaeng nag-fill out ng notebook na s'ya namang ginagamit ko sa buong linggong iyon. ""oo, may isang babae na humawak sa posisyon mo ng panandalian"", - ani ni andrew, habang naka-titig pa rin sa screen ng kanyang screen. pero napansin kong tumigil na s'ya sa pag-tatype o pag-galaw ng mouse. wari ko ay naka-titig lang s'ya sa iisang spot sa monitor n'ya. ""andrew"", - nag-salubong ang mga kilay ko. ""sino 'yung nag-trabaho malapit sa main working space na talagang nakaka-inis? maputla, medyo payat, maitim at kulot na buhok?"" - tanong ko, habang nagpapaikot ng daliri sa bandang ulunan ko para i-describe ang pagkaka-kulot ng nasabing lalake. ""ah... si michael"", - sagot nito, napansin nito ang pagiging iritable ng boses ko. ""may problema ba? ginugulo ka ba n'ya?"" ""hindi"" - sagot ko, pero sa isip-isip ko ay nagtatalo na ang emosyon at sarili ko. ""have a good weekend, andrew"" ""ikaw din"", - sagot nito, halata na may pagtataka sa boses nito habang papaalis ako. sa buong weekend na 'yun ay binabalik-balikan ko ang mga nangyari sa akin sa unang linggo ko. pakiramdam ko may hindi sinasabi si andrew sa akin na importante. wala namang rason para maging iretable s'ya nung nabanggit ko 'yung babaeng nag-trabaho bago ako. may nag-reklamo na kaya kay michael dati? pu-puwede kayang si j. espiritu? si michael ba ang dahilan ng survival guide sa notebook? bakit s'ya umalis? napaka-daming teorya ang bumagabag sa buong weekend ko. bago ko pa nalaman, oras na para bumalik sa trabaho. ito ang araw na talagang sobrang daming trabaho. kahapon ay lunes, ang unang regular day shift. mabilis lang dumaan ang nasabing araw, habang aligaga ako sa pag-sagot ng tawag, recording, sorting at assigning ng dose-dosenang customer complaints sa system namin. hindi sapat ang salitang nasanay na ako at pagkatapos ng araw na 'yun ay sobrang pagod at ubos na ako. saktong maglo-logout na ako, naka-tanggap na naman ako ng mensahe mula sa hindi kilalang number. ""ang sipag mo naman. hindi na ako makapag-hintay na mag night shift ka"" seryoso?! ito ang kauna-unahang mensahe na bumalot sa buong pagkatao ko ng takot. agad-agad kong ginala ang paningin ko kung nasa paligid ba si michael para kumprontahin ko s'ya sa pagse-send ng mensahe, pero kanina pa pala s'ya umalis. matapos kong pakalmahin ang sarili ko, umuwi na ako at sinusubukan kong hanapin si j. espiritu online. ang pinaka best bet ko noon ay sa linkedin, at doon nga ay sinusubukan kong galugarin ang buong listahan ng mga babae na may kinalaman sa proficient technologies na naka-lagay sa profile nila (halos kakaunti lang talaga sila). nung wala akong makita ay pumunta ako kay andrew at doon nga sa friend list n'ya ay sa wakas nakita ko na ang hinahanap ko. may babae na pangalan ay jennah espiritu at unemployed ang status. nag-send ako ng friend request na may mensahe na nag-papakilala at tinanong ko s'ya kung hinarass ba s'ya ng isa n'yang ka-trabaho. sa wakas, pakiramdam ko may patutunguhan na ako, natulog ako at inihanda ang sarili para sa bukas na event. naisip ko na baka may kakaibang mangyayari dahil sa pagbabago ng schedule nung natulog ako ng miyerkules. nag-check ako ng linkedin halos pagka-gising ko mga ala una. walang kahit anong sign kay jennah, kaya naman natulog ulit ako para makapag-handa sa night shift. medyo kinakabahan ako at excited at the same time kasi puwede ko ng mas malibot ang buong place of work ko intimately. dahil walang day crowd, malaya akong makaka-gala at ma-eenjoy ang cookies, dumura sa baso ni michael, kahit ano! may mga iilan pa ring mga nag-tatrabaho nung dumating ako para sa shift ko, pero hindi ko naman iyon pinansin at dahil sa nag-uumapaw na mga tawag at chats na aasikasuhin. makalipas ang dalawang oras, ang bugso ng mga tawag at chats pati mga tickets ay unti-unting bumagal hanggang tuluyan na nga itong tumigil ng sabay-sabay halos alas onse na ng gabi noon. sumandal ako sa kinauupuan ko at ginala-gala ang mga paningin sa aking workspace. wala ng tao noon sa office at least sa nakikita ko. naka-bukas ang lahat ng ilaw pero nung tinanggal ko ang headphones ko, may narinig akong mahinang jingling melody sa hindi kalayuan. para s'yang christmas carol, pero hirap akong tukuyin kong saan ito nangga-galing. wala namang dahilan para matakot ako sa pangyayari, pero pakiramdam ko ang mga nagtayuang balahibo sa mga kamay ko ay nagsilbing alarm. nang tumayo ako sa aking kinauupuan, nawala 'yung melody. well, naging paranoid na ako dati. minsan ko ng inisip na na may lalaking sumusunod sa akin isang gabi hanggang nilagpasan n'ya ako at nagtungo sa kalapit na tindahan sa 'di kalayuan. kahit mag-isa lang ako, lagi kong dino-double at triple check ang mga lock ng bahay bago matulog. aaminin ko na ang mga takot ko ay wala naman talagang basehan. mayroong naka-iwan ng headphones na konektado pa rin sa computer nito at naka-on ang music. o siguro may office party sa ibang kumpanya sa baba ng building. ang makarinig ng kanta ay nakaka-takot lamang sa mga kakatuwang horror movies, 'di ba? 'di ba?! para maka-siguro, hinalughog ko ang office para maka-siguro na mag-isa na nga lang ako. habang naglalakad sa gitna ng mga magkaka-dikit na desks, naisip ko kung gaano ako ka-swerte na mayroon akong sariling corner spot. hindi ko siguro kakayanin na mapalapit sa kahit sinong mga hindi kaaya-aya kong mga co-workers. matapos ko ma-check ang bawat rows ay dumiretcho ako sa front desk area at nagmamasid sa mga kagamitan ni andrew sa paghahanap ng clues. nung wala akong makitang clues ay bumalik ako sa main room ng pantry. unti-unti ng mas nagiging relaxed ang mga senses ko at tsaka ko lang napag-tanto na napasarap ata ang taste-testing ko sa mga cookies sa halip na mag-hanap ng mga kahina-hinalang mga bagay. kailangan ko ng tumigil sa kaka-kain ng cookies, pero dahil bumalik na naman ang kaninang tunog na naririnig ko, mas malakas s'ya ngayon. at the same time, ang work smartphone ko (na kinakailangan dala-dala namin kung aalis kami sa aming work station) tumunog at may mensahe mula sa hindi na namang kilalang number. so, nag-eenjoy ka ba sa cookies, ha? nanigas ang buong katawan ko habang prino-proseso ng utak ko ang mga pangyayari. siguro hindi talaga umalis ng office si michael at ngayon tinatakot ako. kinalikot ko ang tenga ko noon at nakinig ng maigi. walang kahit sino sa pantry as least sa nakikita at naririnig ko. tsaka, kung si michael ay nasa main workspace, hindi naman ganun kahirap na hulaan o sabihin na kumakain ako ng cookies. habang dahan-dahan akong humihinga, hindi ko muna pinansin ang tunog at nakinig ako ng maigi kung may iba pa akong tunog na maririnig. wala. dahan-dahan, naglakad ako sa may pantry drawers at doon may nakita akong malaking kutsilyo. alam ko bang gumamit ng kutsilyo? hindi. kaya ko kayang paalisin kung sino man ang unarmed na kalaban? syempre. papunta na sana ako pabalik sa aking work station ng biglang may tawag na pumasok mula sa work phone. ipinosisyon ko ang sarili ko ng kumportable sa pader ng pantry, kutsilyo sa kanang kamay, cell phone sa kabila, bago pa ako maka-sagot with the standard customer support greeting. nag static na sa kabilang linya at iba pang ingay sunod ang tuluyang pagka-putol ng linya at katahimikan. nung tinignan ko ang cell phone, nakita kong naka-patay na ito. sinubukan kong buksan ulit ito, pero hindi na ito gumagana. ok, ngayon kailangan ko ng bumalik sa computer ko in case na may pumasok pang mga tawag. naalala ko bigla ang isa sa mga guide na galing kay jennah habang isinusuksok ko ang walang kwentang cell phone sa bulsa ko. - laging mag-open ng skype na naka-ready sa emergency in case na hindi gumana ang mobile services. nangyari rin kaya 'to sa kanya? ang mga instructions sa notebook ay unti-unti ng nagkaroon ng kahulugan, at minumura ko ang sarili ko dahil sa pagiging tanga. sa oras na lumabas ang mga salita sa bibig ko ay may isa na namang mensahe ang dumating sa cell phone. kinuha ko iyon at sinubukang i-unlock, pero 'yung regular home screen ay hindi lumalabas. ang lumabas lang ay isang white screen na may maikling text. putang ina. ang mga babae dapat hindi ginagamit ng ganung mga uri ng salita. matapos kong mabasa 'yun ay nawala na ito sa screen at may panibagong text ang lumabas. bakit hindi ka lumabas at makipag-laro? huwag mo ng isiping bitbitin pa 'yang kutsilyong hawak mo. wala ring magagawa 'yan sa hawak kong baril. tinapon ko ang cell phone ko sa lapag at agad-agad ay nagtungo ako sa aking computer. ang tunog ay mas lalong lumakas habang papalapit ako sa aking lamesa, doon ay nakita kong may isang baboy na stuffed toy. may fabric button ito sa bandang paanan at music note na kasama. dito nagmumula ang tunog at nagpapatunay lamang na hindi ako mag-isa at may kung sino akong kasama. ang malala pa, pinapanood nila ang bawat galaw ko at sinusubukang takutin gamit ang mga laruang pambata. unti-unti ng dumadaloy ang pagpapanic sa aking buong katawan at naghahanda na sa fight or flight scenario. huminga ako ng malalim, sinusubukan kong pakalmahin ang buong katawan ko. so far wala pa naman akong naririnig ng kahit anong palatandaan na may ibang tao sa loob ng office. may mga background noises galing sa syudad sa labas at ang mga ingay mula sa naka-limutang patayin na computer ng isang employee. kung sino man ang gumagawa nito sa akin, kailangan kong malaman ang kanilang eksaktong lokasyon para maplano ko ng maayos ang pag-takas ko. isa pa, kailangan kong maka-kuha ng tulong sa lalong mas madaling panahon. habang iginigilid ko ang laruan ay umupo na ako sa aking upuan at pinull-up ang skype for business application. mabilis akong nag-dial ng 911, habang naka-loudspeaker ang telepono. tumunog na nga ang dial tone at agad-agad ay may live operator na sa kabilang linya. ibibigay ko na sana ang mga hindi kanais-nais na pangyayari sa akin ng mga oras na iyon ng may biglang humawak sa bukong-bukong ko mula sa ilalim ng lamesa. halos maubos ang buong lakas ko sa pagsigaw habang nagpu-pumiglas ang mga paa at mabilis na tumakbo sa abot ng aking makakaya sa bilis na hindi ko akaling kaya ko. may narinig akong kung anong kumusyon sa aking likuran habang tumakbo, kasunod ng isang malakas ng putok, na inisip ko na lamang na galing sa kung ano o sino man ang humahabol sa akin. bago ko pa malaman ay halos nasa ground floor na ako papunta sa pinto lagpas sa gwardiya na halatang nagulat sa mga nangyayari. ang malamig na hangin ay mabilis na pumasok sa manipis kong sweater habang papalapit ako sa isang malapit na pedestrian para humingi ng tulong. tumawag sila ng 911 at ang mga pulis ay agad namang dumating wala pang sampung minuto. habang naghihintay ako kasama ang gwardiya para sa kanilang pag-dating, hindi maalis sa isip ko ang sinulat ni jennah na warning, at kung gaano ako ka-tanga para ipagsa walang bahala ang mga ito. - i-check ang ang bawat aisle, meeting room. huwag kalimutang i-check ang ilalim ng lamesa, balkonahe, kitchen tables at kahit likod ng cooler. agad-agad namang sinulat ng pulis ang mga nangyari sa akin at iniwan ako kasama ang isang pulis officer, umakyat s'ya para i-check ang office. wala namang naka-labas-masok sa building mula nung tumakbo ako palabas, kaya malaki ang posibilidad na naroroon pa rin ang salarin at nagtatago sa loob. sa pag-iisip ay halos bumaliktad ang buong sikmura ko at mas lalo akong lumapit sa may armas kong kasama. maya-maya pa matapos kaming iwanan ng mga pulis, ang kasama kong pulis ay nag-radyo at isa-isa may mga boses na nagpapa-palit-palit sa radyo na humingi ng backup at nga mga codes na hindi ko maintindihan. mabilis na nag-escalate ang mga sumunod na pangyayari. imbis na pauwi ay dinala nila ako sa police station at doon ay nanatili ako sa isang interrogation room ng halos 2 oras bago pa sa wakas may dalawang pulis officer ang kumausap sa akin. pagod na ako noon, miserable ang kalagayan at higit sa lahat litong-lito sa kung papaano naganap ang mga pangyayari. gusto ko ng umuwi pero nanatili pa ako ng ilang oras para i-kuwento ang mga pangyayari sa dalawang pulis officer. 'ahh... meron kang kutsilyong hawak habang tumakbo ka galing sa pantry papunta sa lamesa mo? sigurado ka ba?' tanong ng isang nakaka-tandang officer na nagpakilala bilang senior investigator manlapig. 'ah. ah... oo.' pautal-utal kong sagot sa kanya. 'naniniwala akong meron. nag-papanic na ako noon, kaya mahirap sabihin. tapos may baboy na stuffed toy, ' sabi ko, habang tila baga'y nawawalan ako ng abilidad na mag-isip ng tama. 'at naniniwala ka na ang taong humaharass sa'yo ay si michael villareal?' sabi ng isa pang officer, hindi ko maalala 'yung pangalan n'ya. wala s'yang badge. 'hindi ko alam buong pangalan n'ya, pero wala na akong ibang kilala na iba pang responsable.' 'at sa huling pagkakataon, just for the record, anong nangyari matapos mong mag-dial ng 911?' tanong ni manlapig sa ika-apat na pagkakataon sa gabing 'yun. 'may kung sino ang humawak sa binti ko. bukong-bukong, actually. nangyari 'yun bago pa ako magkaroon ng pagkakataong ipaliwanag ang sitwasyon sa operator. nagsusumigaw at piglas ang mga paa ko tapos tumakbo hanggang may makita akong tao sa labas na pina-tawag ako sa 911 para sa tulong.' sagot ko, habang pagod na pagod sa paulit-ulit at paikot-ikot na pagtatanong. 'si michael villareal ay natagpuang patay sa hindi kalayuan ng iyong lamesa nung pumunta ang officer namin sa pinang-yarihan ng insidente. nakita mo ba ang kanyang katawan nung tumakbo ka palabas ng office?' tanong ng isang officer. halos malaglag ang panga ko sa mga narinig ko at tumitig sa dalawang pulis habang balisa at nanginginig sa takot. 'hi.. hi.. hindi,' pabulong akong nag-salita, 'hindi ko maintindihan,' 'sinaksak s'ya hanggang sa mamatay gamit ang malaking kutsilyo. ang katawan n'ya ay balot ng dalawampu't-tatlong saksak,' paliwanag ni manlapig. 'at nakita namin ang kutsilyo ay nakabaon sa bibig nito, dahilan para dumikit ito sa sahig diretcho sa lalamunan,' 'may rason kami para pagsuspetyahan na ito rin ang sinasabi mong kutsilyo,' dagdag pa ng pangalawang officer. nakatitig ako sa dalawang pulis officer ng tahimik, hirap akong intindihin ang mga pangyayari lalo na't ang utak ko ay halos mawala na sa ulirat. 'ang mga sinabi mo ay nagpapatunay lamang sa mga natagpuaan namin sa cell phone ni michael villareal. nalaman namin na may roon siyang hacking apps,' pagpapatuloy ng senior officer. 'natagpuan din naman ang ilan mo pang mga hubong larawan at ang mga mensahe na iyong nabanggit. mayroon s'yang baril at nakita rin naman ang basyo ng bala nung binaril ka n'ya habang papatakas ka.' 'ang hindi namin maintindihan ay kung papaano s'ya namatay.' dagdag pa ng pangalawang officer, halatang hindi s'ya naniniwala sa aking reaksyon. 'ok lang kung napatay mo s'ya dahil sa self-defense, aya. may balak s'yang masama sa'yo.' 'hindi,' pautal-utal kong sagot. 'pangako, wala akong ideya... oh, oh my god.' naiyak na ako dahil sa mga nangyayari. 'ibig kong sabihin, nung nakaraang buwan lang may nag-report sa kanya galing sa isa n'yang co-worker,' sabi ni manlapig. 'jennah,' bulong ko. 'kilala mo si miss espiritu?' tanong ng pangalawang officer, at ng suspetya sa kanyang mga mats. 'hindi,' ako ang pumalit sa lamesa n'ya at nakuha ko ang notebook n'ya. dapat sinabi ko na 'to kanina pa. anong sabi sa report? doon nga ay nagtitigan ang dalawang pulis at maka-lipas ang ilang sandali ay inilatag at ipinaliwanag ni manlapig ang mga hindi magandang nangyari kay jennah na halos mangyari na sa akin. si jennah espiritu ay dumiretcho sa pinaka-malapit na hospital mula sa kanyang unang night shift tatlong buwan na ang nakakaraan. sobrang bugbog ng katawan n'ya at sugatan, at gustong mag-file ng anonymous rape kit. ang natanong damage n'ya sa kanyang puwerta ay sobrang severe na kinailangan n'yang sumailalim sa operasyon at magpatahi. nag-file s'ya ng police report makalipas ang dalawang buwan matapos s'yang hindi pumasa sa probationary period sa inyong kumpanya, ng nawala s'ya sa trabaho (ang nagiisang paraan para mabayaran ang kanyang utang sa hospital). ang nangyari ay ang kanyang aligasyon kontra kay michael villareal, na gumastos s'ya ng malaki sama mo pa ang hindi mabilang na kanyang mga co-workers na kumontra sa kanya laban sa magalang at kaaya-ayang katangian ni michael. 'pero kahapon lang ay iniurong na n'ya lahat ng mga isinampa n'yang kaso kay michael,' sabi ng walang badge na pulis. 'kasalukuyan naming inaalam ang kinaroroonan ni espiritu para ma-interview namin s'ya. sigurado ako na ngayon malinaw na kung bakit may suspetya kami sa iyo bilang nakikilala mo espiritu.' nagpatuloy ang mga tanong ng dalawang pulis hanggang may isang lalaki na nag-abot sa kanya ng isang sobre. natukoy na ng forensics ang fingerprint na nakita sa kutsilyo at ang blood-spatter patterns. kinailangan ko ring mag-submit ng dna samples para maka-tulong sa imbestigasyon at sa wakas ay pina-uwi na nila ako. sa bahay, dahil sa sobrang pagod, hindi ako maka-tulog. wala akong gamit na naiuwi. bag, cell phone at kahit ang jacket ko ay kinailangan i-submit bilang ebidensya. kaya naman napilitan akong gamitin ang luma kong laptop, umaasa na malibang sa internet. ang browser ko ay naka-login pa rin sa linkedin account ko mula sa nakaraang login, at nirefreshed ko ang page bilang naka-sanayan. isang maliit na red icon ang lumitaw na mayroon akong bagong mensahe. jennah. nagre-reply na s'ya sa akin. don't worry, sis. i took care of it. ❤️",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/t77k69/tagalized_story/,5 03 2022
Moving out/running away from my emotionally abusive father who was away for 10 years,"tl;dr: emotionally abusive ofw father recently came home after 10 years and we had a huge fight which made me too uncomfortable too stay in this house. already planned to move out even before he came home but he might think i'm moving out because of him (tho it's also true). i don't know how to tell him that i'm moving out knowing his tendencies hello, i’m 23 years old and my father was an ofw for 10 years. i won't go into details sa history ng pagiging emotionally abusive/manipulative niya before and during the time na nasa abroad siya since that would be too long considering na mahaba din yung story. anyways, umuwi siya last month and since di sila okay ng mother ko, umalis na yung mother ko sa bahay so natira kami ng kuya ko. nung first two days ang bait niya so naisip ko parang ang judgemental ko na inisip ko mga masasamang bagay sa kanya dati but then i was immediately proved wrong. on the second night pumasok siya sa kwarto ko nang lasing at 1 am and patulog na ako since may work pa the next day. verbatimly sabi niya “lasing tatay mo” and then proceed to ask some questions, catching up ganun and at the same time ilang beses niya inuulit na na tabi daw kami matulog and despite me saying no multiple times, lumapit pa rin siya at tumabi. at first wala akong ginawa since tatabi lang naman but then sumiksik siya nang sumiksik and that’s when i got uncomfortable so tumayo ako at lumabas ng kwarto para sana uminom ng tubig pero sumunod siya sa baba so tumakbo ako pabalik ng kwarto and nilock yung pinto. he kept on knocking and calling for my name pero ang sagot ko lang ay “matulog ka na pa bukas na tayo mag usap pag di ka na lasing” but of course he kept on denying na lasing siya. eventually he said “sisirain ko ‘tong pinto mo” and started banging on the door loudly tapos may ginagawa pa siyang di ko alam sa doorknob so i started shouting saying na ipapabarangay ko siya pag di siya tumigil but he didn’t stop and confidently said “oh sige” until he finally opened the door without a key. that alone was scary plus may expression pa sa mukha niya na di ko maexplain basta nakakatakot so tumakbo ako malapit sa kwarto ng kuya ko just in case na may gawin siya. sumunod siya then he started his manipulative sad boi session saying na 10 years siya nagsakripisyo para samin tapos ganun lang turing ko sa kanya, how he always wanted to go to college dati pero hindi kaya ng parents niya so nag ofw siya para hindi namin maexperience yun. hindi daw siya nanunumbat but kept on saying na hindi ako makakapag aral sa ganitong school kung di dahil sa kanya which is factually wrong since yung nanay ko yung nababaon sa utang para lang makabayad sa tuition namin dahil bihira siya magpadala. sinisigawan niya ko the whole time habang dinuduro duro ako. nakipag sigawan din ako asking questioning his actions that night then i made mention of the other traumatizing things he did and how he never realized that he's wrong but he kept on mentioning the 10 years/gusto niya magcollege. i ended it by saying na hindi ko naman ginusto mabuhay bakit siya nag anak tapos isusumbat niya lang lahat. days after that he started acting nice again cooking my favorite foods, other acts of service, etc but there was no apology, he’s acting like nothing happened and that we’re ok. i mean gets naman na ganun yung karamihan ng parents but the experience was not the same for me. until now i’m still anxious whenever we’re in the same room so i’m trying my best para umiwas magtatanong nga lang kung kumain na ako kumakabog na dibdib ko. di siya kumakatok sa pinto bago pumasok so iniiwan ko nalang na bukas para marinig ko and maready ko sarili ko pag papasok siya. and lastly tuwing iinom siya (around 3 times a week) kailangan ko i-barricade yung pinto sa takot. basta this home is no longer a safe place for me and gusto ko na lumipat plus kami rin naman ng kuya ko yung nagbabayad sa lahat ng gastusin. may nakita na akong lilipatan na malapit dun sa area kung saan nagsstay nanay ko tho dito pa rin sa barangay yung place. pinapalipat na ko next week and i don't know kung pano ako magpapaalam without any drama knowing na may sadboi tendencies nga yung tatay ko. tbh plan ko na talaga lumipat ng bahay by the end of the year bago pa umuwi yung tatay ko, baka kasi isipin niya na lilipat ako ng bahay dahil sa kanya tho it's true, hindi naman yun yung sole reason. i don't know what reactions i will get since the last time na nagpost ako dito about him natawag akong ""entitled brat"" for not appreciating his sacrifice despite showing evidence of him being an asshole but i just wanted to share my experience and maybe get some advice on how to tell him that i'm moving out",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/r6d7on/moving_outrunning_away_from_my_emotionally/,1 12 2021
"HR People / Talent Recruiters, realistic ba dito sa atin 'yung paglalagay ng work achievements instead of role description sa Resume/CV?","may nabasa kasi akong blog post na mas mainam daw ilagay 'yung quantifiable achievements mo sa work, e.g., managed 15 people and mentorship resulted in the promotion of 3 team members, instead na brief description ng role under the experience/employment history section ng resume or cv. naitanong ko lang din kasi i am under the impression na mas bumebenta pa rin sa hr / recruiters 'yung mga bigating title or educational background. would really appreciate your feedback esp. now na marami siguro sa atin ang nagja-job search dahil sa challenges na dala ng covid-19.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/gftpvn/hr_people_talent_recruiters_realistic_ba_dito_sa/,8 05 2020
Paano kayo nagccope up sa pagkawala ng mahal ninyo sa buhay?,"it's been 2 weeks since my father died. sobrang bilis, ang lakas niya pa lang tapos bigla na lang siyang nastroke. sabi ng doctor niya makakauwi na siya, pero yung day na dapat uuwi na siya ang day ng libing niya. hanggang ngayon, hindi pa rin mawala sa isip ko kung may pagkukulang ang mga doctor ni papa. doctor ni papa na cardiologist ang humawak sa case niya, nadiagnose siya ng hemorrhagic stroke, pumutok ang ugat sa utak niya at kailangan pigilan ang pagkalat ng dugo. sobrang confident namin sa doc ni papa kasi sabi magaling daw, ang sabi after 5 days ic-ct scan ulit si papa. ang lakas ni papa kahit nung 1-2 days niya sa icu. inaalis niya pa ngt sa ilong niya and malikot ang left side niya though hindi niya magalaw ang right side ng katawan niya at hindi namin siya makausap. 3rd day ni papa sa icu, sinabihan siya ng doctor niya na makakalabas na siya ng icu ng thursday (saturday ng madaling araw na stroke si papa at nadala namin siya agad sa ospital). at sabi, saturday makakauwi na siya sa amin. ayan ang advise ng doc niya sa amin bago umalis ang doc ni papa at nagseminar o may pinuntahan sa ibang bansa at iniwan sa isang doc na iternist. that day, nanghina si papa. ang dating malakas na grip na kamay niya at malikot niyang paggalaw ay humina... akala namin okay na... sobrang taranta na namin at late na na may nakapagsabi sa amin na kakilala na bakit walang neurologist si papa. kailangan daw niya neuro. late rin namin nalaman na cardio and internist doctors lang humahawak kay papa. before that, tanong na kami nang tanong sa mga nurses. nagtanong pa kami bakit hindi pa ict-scan si papa dahil nanghina siya. ang sabi, hindi na raw kailangan daw lalabas na siya. binawasan din mga gamot niya. kaso ang sabi nagka-infection daw siya sa dugo dahil hindi mawala ang lagnat niya kay binigyan siya ng antibiotics. thursday nang malaman namin na walang neuro si papa at kailangan niya ng neuro. pinilit namin na ipatingin si papa sa neuro kahit na nagagalit na samin mga nurses. cardio raw ang kailangan ni papa at hindi neuro. pinapirma kami ng waiver na kami ang nag-ask for neuro at hindi ang doctor ni papa. turns out, nang icheck siya ng neuro bakit daw hindi na-ct scan agad. dapat 2-3 days na ct scan daw ulit para malaman kung namaga utak ni papa. mali pa raw ang antibiotics na ibinibigay kay papa, sobrang baba raw dapat daw malakas dahil sa utak nga daw ang problema ni papa. thursday night, bumagsak katawan ni papa. ang gcs niya from 10 nang dinala namin siya sa ospital to 3. kumalat na daw ang dugo sa utak ni papa as per result ng ct scan sabi ng neuro niya baka kailanganin niya ng surgery. that night, sobrang bumaba bp niya, naging abnormal heartbeat niya at super nahirapan siyang huminga nilagyan na siya ng tube. super sakit akala namin makakauwi na siya tapos friday ng madaling araw nawala na siya. super sakit, before siya mastroke pinag-uusapan pa lang namin graduation ko. sabi niya super proud siya sa amin magkakapatid. ngayon hindi na niya ako makikitang ggraduate....yung panganay niya, walang tatay sa graduation. hindi ko alam kung may pagkukulang mga doctors niya or what, until now di pa rin namin nassettle ang bill. ang hirap magsalita kasi di naman kami expert pero para sa akin may pagkukulang sila. hindi ko sila sinisisi pero ang sama-sama ng loob ko!!! may times na parang okay na, pero kapag naaalala ko si papa... ang sakit-sakit, sobrang miss ko na siya. sobrang miss ko na ang papa ko. unang anak niya na mapapagraduate niya ng college, hindi niya makikita... kahit na mahirap, pinag-aaral niya kaming apat. ang sakit-sakit pa rin... hindi ko alam paano magccope up sa pagkawala ni papa...",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/14hwjjn/paano_kayo_nagccope_up_sa_pagkawala_ng_mahal/,24 06 2023
Story time: Uninformed News Edition,"a friend showed me a tiktok video of a supposed influencer sharing his thoughts on covid. the video (with embedded texts) went like this: ""storytime: covid 19 edition and then dinala sa hospital, dead on arrival. then sabi nung doctor sa mga kamag anak. kung papayag yung family na ang ilagay sa death cert nung namatay ay covid instead of heart attack 😱😱. so yun lang, idk what to do with that information kaya skl."" let me answer you, what you should do with that information is ask someone who is knowledgeable on the topic or at least someone who knows more than you do, cause you definitely don't know a lot. what you should not do though is post a video putting the hospital and medical professionals in a malicious light. for those of you who wants to be educated on the topic: anyone who is symptomatic, we can't mix with those who do not have the symptoms. ubo, sipon, lagnat, hirap sa paghinga, pananakit ng kasukasuan, pagsusuka, pagtatae or pagkawala ng pang-amoy at panlasa. you might be wondering, eh ang daming sakit with the same symptoms. yes, kaya nga po puno ang emergency rooms and covid floors. unless proven na negative ka sa covid (with rt-pcr), it is prudent that we don't place you with those without the symptoms. hospital protocols also dictates that anyone who arrives dead will be tagged as covid suspect (relating to the tiktok vid, paano nasabing heart attack? may ckmb ka? may trop i ka? may ecg ka ba???). covid also complicates underlying conditions like heart, brain problems which might have led to the demise of the patient. did the patient die of a heart problem? possible. did the patient die of covid? possible. hindi sya exclusive, and unless we do post-mortem swab, we will not know. the government ideally should fund more research centers and laboratories, to make testing more available kahit sa maralita. sayang yung mga inutang. hindi lahat ng tao afford ang 2-5k na rt-pcr swab na may 7 days validity lang. pag may rt-pcr ka na timely ang collection, you need not be tagged as suspect and can be treated sa covid negative area, therefore decongesting the covid suspect area, therefore freeing some resources that can be used for those in critical conditions. i am all for freedom of expression, but i also believe in responsible posting. supposed ~influencers~ should help us eradicate misinformation, use their platform for greater good. you also address your audience well. isang taon na tayong lockdown, ang dami nang dinagdag na letra sa cq. baka naman po? if you have any questions, if in any way i can explain things in simpler terms. i also urge people in the medical field to answer people the simplest way possible, to be ""patola"" na. our job extends way outside the corners of the hospital. di na lang covid ang kalaban, bad governance, ignorance and misinformation too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/mgihgq/story_time_uninformed_news_edition/,30 03 2021
Loss of Smell,"hello there! i am 32 years old and i think i have covid. i haven’t taken the pcr test yet and i chose to self-quarantine muna for 14 days. i had fever, cough and colds these past few days pero wala na siya nung isang araw pa. kaso nung isang araw, nawalan na lang ako bigla ng pang-amoy and na-apektuhan na rin ung panlasa ko. i can still taste food with strong flavors like oranges, vinegar, candies and i can still smell a bit of garlic cloves and eucalyptus pero that’s it, as in ang babaw na lang ng naamoy ko considering na strong fragrances ung garlic and essential oil. ung mga ulam na gulay, chicken, wala na talaga akong nalalasahan parang kumakain na lang ako ng kanin at tubig. to those na may ganitong symptoms, what’s the best way to cope with day to day activities? sana gumaling na ako. :(",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/mdfsa6/loss_of_smell/,26 03 2021
Our COVID story,"so kakatapos lang ng 14 day isolation namin and our lgu declared us covid recovered. i just want to share my experience regarding this. around april 19 my lola started developing a cough that progressed into pneumonia. since she hasn't gone outside since the pandemic started it took a week before our doctor recommended we get her swabbed. she tested positive april 24 and was admitted into a hospital april 27. the rest of our family got swabbed april 28 and the results came back positive for my mom and i. our lgu had us admitted into an isolation facility (15 min drive from our barangay) april 29. we stayed there for 14 days and we are currently back home. regarding our covid symptoms timeline, around the same time lola started coughing napapansin ko na ilang araw akong nahihilo at nag-lbm. nagkasore eyes din ako for a few days. day 3 sa isolation facility nawalan ako ng pang-amoy at sumama nadin yung panlasa ko. losing your sense of smell and taste is weird to say the least. as for my case i did not have any trouble breathing nor did i have a clogged nose, wala ka lang talagang maamoy at ang nalalasahan mo lang ay maalat at matamis, no complex flavors. thankfully, this only lasted for about 3-4 days. also developed a rash but thats about it. my mom developed a fever for a day and started coughing but that was quickly treated. for the facility naman i can't really complain. we stayed in a big hall type building na naka divider per cell(?)/room(?). the place was well ventilated and air conditioned. you get food 3 times a day. pwede ka rin magpadala ng extra food or other items outside from your family and friends so thats a plus. shared yung cr pero malinis naman. the facility itself was like a small subdivision, pwede ka magexercise and walk or jog around the place in the morning and in the afternoon. staff were friendly and helpful too. our whole 14 day stay was free from the accommodation to the food and the medicine. dahil most of us there were mild/asymptomatic and everyone was friendly and helpful hindi naging depressing yung atmosphere and that helped us get through the 2 weeks. sadly, my lola didn't make it and she said goodbye may 8. while my mom and i are thankful that we recovered, nakakalungkot din yung uuwi ka knowing na abo na yung isang tao na naging part ng buhay mo since bata ka. please stay safe guys. get vaccinated if you can. while we were lucky that we got through this, marami din ang hindi. if not for yourself think of those around you. the virus is and was always a big deal, i just hope more people realize that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/nb9os1/our_covid_story/,13 05 2021

68 Spill-the-tea Pinoy showbiz edition (From March 2020). Can anyone confirm number 62?,"1. rico yan died from suicide. he knew about the score with claudine and raymart and claudine had to abort their child. rico couldn't handle the situation and went high on drugs. commited suicide afterwards. yun pala reason kaya galit na galit family ni rico kay claudine. 2. janella salvador is a lesbian. her mom is pretty awful to her as well. napaka inggrata namang iina eh anak niya naman ata source of income nila. i can understand if they want to hide it. being closeted is shitty but still understandable in this country. but why not let the girl be? hide it if they want for the sake of her career but don't supress it. let the girl sleep with other girls if that's who she is. kaya nagiging suicidal ang ibang lgbt kids eh. 3. atong ang and gretchen baretto sleeps together. tina tagle also hinted about it on her blogs. apparently atong also bangs claudine. 4. ruffa gutierrez is a paid high-end escort. also, they said that's the reason why ruffa ended up with bektas, a turkish 'mobster', due to this pimping business of anabelle. the sultan of brunei, bolkiah, had ruffa delivered to him at forbes park. 5. paul soriano was caught having an affair with erich. 6. (eto mas confirmed at open naman talaga) marjorie baretto is the mistress of echiverri. gretchen even alluded to it when she was on rage mode a few months back by saying that after clau and her, si echiverri nag paaral sa mga anak ni marjorie. 7. (open talaga) danding cojuangco's mistress for the past 20 years is aileen damileng, a former beauty queen. they have 2 daughters. you can see their photos all over her instagram. 8. kim domingo used to work for a club but strictly no touching/sex. apparently, manny pacquiao ""visits"" her on weekends. taas siguro ng fee niya ngayon. kim domingo is apparently a high end paid escort. she was anal-ed by ginebra's governor alfrancis chua which is why she got the stint to become ginebra's muse hahaha. 9. some say that 22 out of the 24 from the 24k girls of the show deal or no deal are high end escorts and use the show to market themselves with the assistant direk as the pimp. ang modus, may tatawag kay asst. direk after the show at mag tatanong kung pwede ibook itong si suitcase # whatever. think of it as an aquarium sa spa pero thru tv. pag uusapan nila ang presyo at may cut si direk sa ""talent"" fee nila. price range from 12k a night to 150k and some of the regular clients are high profile politicians. 10. most loveteams are fake/pilit. i remembered when the guy in a popular love team (james reid), naka sabay ko sa elevator sa condo. he is with this 'hot girl' they are ""sort of making out”. the girl she is with is ""way way hotter"" than his love team team. 🙂 kahit anung magazine pang mag sabi na sexiest yung ka love team nya. 11. liza soberano and enrique gil are also made up. 12. richard gomez had a light buld shoved up his ass back in the 90’s by either ben chan (owner of bench, and is why he’s always in every bench commercials back then), or jaime ayala. richard had to travel all the way to hong kong just to have his asshole stitched. 13. kris aquino had std courtesy of joey marquez (further reading here: 14. piolo pascual is gay. 15. angel aquino is bi/gay. 16. bea alonzo is/was bi (she had a girlfriend before). 17. alden richards is also on the list of closeted gay celebs. 18. sen. bong revilla tried getting cozy with ellen adarna using lewd text messages. he also did this to a couple of other women. 19. kat alano and mo twister had drunken sex. 20. model tina wells and michelle madrigal apparently had a one-night stand with kobe bryant. 21. manny pacquiao “gifted” erich gonzales to kobe bryant for a one-night stand. 22. hayden kho doesn't sleep with virgins. 23. list of vice ganda’s boys are: terrence romeo, zeus, ronnie alonte, and a few other uaap players. 24. halos lahat nang public tv show ng abs ay fixed. lalo na yun pbb. marami sa mga contestant don di naman nila nakuha sa wild. more than half don may backer sa abs. nagulat ba kayo bakit bigla nila tinangal yun ""live""? kasi kumakalat don baho nila. tignan niyo yun mga contestants, pagsikat na don lumalabas na modelo pala, mayaman pala. 25. sa abs may backer system don. kahit di ka talaga sumisikat, magkakaprojects ka pa din kung malakas backer mo. meron rin mga tao na magugulat kayo sumusulpot lang bigla pag birthday nila o kaya kakasal sila? sikat pa ba to bakit nila finefeature to? ang pangit umarte nito bakit kinukuha pa to? gotta ask yourself, ano kaya habol ng mga backer don? hehe. example: wenn deramas always had dj durano sa mga projects niya. 26. ung bigla nagbakasyon sa ibang bansa yun artista, maalki chance buntis yon. sa ibang bansa magpapalaglag. this is common in the industry. don't be fooled. buti pa yun isa no umamim. di na tuloy gumana yun bs machine nang abs pero sinubukan nila sa umpisa. umamim alng talga yun artista. examples are rhian ramos and kc concepcion. 27. nalala nyo yun anne curtis bar incident? totoo yon. galing nila no naginterview pa sila nang artista nila para ideny na nangyari yon kahit na nagsorry si anne curtis at maraming tao ang nakakita don? 28. halos lahat nang ""celebrity couples"" ay gimik lang. halos lahat don nagkadevelopan lang dahil ineecounrage sila na lagi dapat sila magkasama kahit saan. fixed rin yun mga overseas travels nila. pagpapakita nang pictures sa insta/twitter?

"Pahayag ni VP Leni Robredo: Ulat, Mungkahi Ukol sa Pandemya, at Mensahe ng Pag-asa","pahayag ni vp leni robredo: ulat, mungkahi ukol sa pandemya, at mensahe ng pag-asa sa puntong ito, halos isang buwan na na mahigit isang libo bawat araw ang dagdag sa mga covid positive cases ng bansa. halos magdadalawang libo na rin ang pumanaw, bukod pa sa napakaraming naospital, naubusan ng ipon, nawalan ng trabaho, o nakakaranas ng paghihirap at pangamba sa mga panahong ito. mahigit limang buwan na ang lumilipas mula nang naiulat ang unang kaso ng covid-19 sa ating bansa. sa malaking bahagi ng panahong ito, minabuti ng tanggapan ng pangalawang pangulo na gawin ang makakaya upang tumugon sa kahit anong paraan basta may maitulong, gaano man kalimitado ang aming budget o mandato. humaharap ako sa inyo ngayon upang iulat ang mga natutuhan namin sa panahong iyon: ang feedback mula sa mga eksperto, mula sa mga doktor, at mula sa mga pinakaapektado—ang hinaing ng mga nasa komunidad, ng mga frontliners, ng mga napipilitang sumugod sa panganib dahil kailangang magtrabaho, ng mga drivers, ng mga locally-stranded individuals na napipilitang matulog sa hagdan o bangketa. sa harap ng ganitong kalaking krisis, lalo lang tayong malalagay sa panganib kung matitibag ang mga institusyon nating pampamahalaan. ituring sanang karagdagang ambag ang pahayag na ito—mga rekomendasyon at aral mula sa halos limang buwan na naming pakikipag-ugnayan sa ating mga kababayan para labanan ang covid. hindi mapipigil ang pandemya kung basta mag-aabang na lang tayo ng bakuna. kailangang maampat ang pagkalat nito sa lalong madaling panahon. nagsisimula ang lahat sa tamang datos, na pundasyon ng tamang desisyon. mula dito, matutukoy ang kung sino at aling mga lugar ang dapat tutukan pagdating sa mass testing, contact tracing, at suporta sa mga komunidad at ospital. kung magiging tama ang tugon sa aspekto ng healthcare, mako-control ang community transmission, magiging mas mabilis, ligtas, at strategic ang pagbubukas ng ekonomiya, maiiwasan ang pagkawala ng trabaho, at hindi na dadami pa ang dadanas ng kahirapan. mababawasan ang pangamba ng pagsasara, at hindi na kakailanganing umabot sa punto ng pagle-layoff sa mga empleyado, o mas malala, sa pagtiklop ng mga negosyo. ito ang broad strokes ng plano. wala akong duda na mulat ang pamahalaan dito. pero malaki ang krisis, at maraming dapat gawin, kaya kailangan nating lahat maging mas maliksi sa pagtukoy sa mga puwang, at maging mabilis at malikhain sa pagpuno nito. heto ang ilang mungkahi: una, linisin at pabilisin ang pagkalap ng datos ukol sa covid-19. kung magagawa ito, magiging mas matibay ang pinagmumulan ng mga desisyon, polisiya, at programa para mapigilan ang paglaganap ng virus. marami nang mga eksperto ang naglabas ng iba’t ibang platform para maging repository ng datos. ang kailangang gawin, piliin ang pinakamainam dito, at gumawa ng isang ecosystem ng pagtugon kung saan standard ang pagka-sentralisado. isa pa: kung mali at buhol-buhol ang pag-input ng data, babagal ang validation; babagal din ang proseso ng decision-making. halimbawa: sa data na nakakalap, may discrepancy sa mga nagpositive at confirmed cases. may mahigit 113,000 cases ang nagpositive sa testing, ngunit nasa 80,000 pa lang nito ang confirmed cases. ibig sabihin, kailangan talagang humabol ang verification, dahil maraming positive ang hindi agad naisasama sa opisyal na data. dapat magkaroon ng communications campaign para ang mga nagpapagamot mismo ang tumiyak na wastong impormasyon ang naitatala tungkol sa kanila. malawak ang kakayahan ng pamahalaang magpalaganap ng impormasyon, kaya umaasa tayong magagawa ito sa lalong madaling panahon. ikalawa, at karugtong nito: isama ang mga pamantasan at academic institutions para tumulong sa validation process ng doh. maraming gustong tumulong, pero may mga pagkukulang sa volunteer management process. ilista ang mga handang tumulong at ang kanilang kakayahan, at agad na silang iugnay sa mga unit na nangangailangan ng tulong upang ma-maximize ang kakayahang ito. maraming paraan para ma-maximize ang mga gustong tumulong. halimbawa na lang, puwede nilang pag-aralan ang surveillance at pooled testing: igugrupo ang mga tao at itetest nang minsanan ang grupong ito. kung nag-negative na, hindi na sila kailangang isa-isahin pa. sa ganitong paraan, mas marami ang matetest, pero mas makakatipid sa mga testing kit. ikatlo, siguruhing mabilis ang turnover time ng mga covid-19 tests. alamin kung bakit nagkakabacklog, kung saang mga laboratoryo ito nagaganap, at tulungan silang makahabol. sa ganitong paraan, on-time ding mahahabol ng mga contact tracers ang mga dapat pang i-test. sa contact tracing, alam nating may mga model at teknolohiya nang gumagana, tulad na lang ng sa baguio. para wala nang kanya-kanya, tumukoy na tayo agad ng iisang platform at technology, iisang standard na proseso, at imungkahi sa mga lgu na ito ang gamitin kaysa magkanya-kanyang diskarte. ikaapat, ukol naman sa mga locally-stranded individuals: nagpadala na tayo ng rekomendasyon sa kinauukulan na bigyan sila ng libreng swab test bago bumiyahe. hinahanap din ang mas organisadong pagpo-proseso ng mga lsi—at hindi ‘yong napipilitan silang matulog sa semento o sa ilalim ng tulay, o nagsisiksikan at nalalagay sa mas matinding peligro ng exposure sa covid. kailangang maglaan ng maayos na lugar kung saan puwede silang maghintay ng biyahe nang may sapat na espasyo at kung saan din ine-enforce na minimum health standards. dagdag pa rito, kailangan ding tutukan at bigyang-lakas ang mga lgu para pag-uwi ng mga lsi, magkakaroon sila ng maayos na pagkakakitaan. puwede itong gawin through cash-for-work programs na partikular para sa mga lsi. ikalima: sang-ayon tayo sa pagkakaroon ng isang “whole of nation approach.” maisagawa sana ito higit pa sa pagkakaroon ng mga bagong posisyon, bansag, o titulo ng mga tauhan. ang totoong whole of nation approach, maayos ang pangangasiwa at kumukumpas sa iisang direksyon. aling direksyon, at sino ang kukumpas? dapat public health professional na tunay na nakakaintindi ng problema: pandemya ang ugat ng lahat ng suliranin ngayon. kapag napigil ang pandemya, isa-isa na ring malulutas ang iba pang hamon, kasama na ang sa ekonomiya. ikaanim: siguruhin ding iisa ang kumpas ng pampubliko at pribadong sektor. bukod pa sa usapin ng data, pagdating din sa ayuda at sa procurement ng mga kagamitan, marami ang pagkakanya-kanya na kung maiiwasan ay magdudulot ng mas maliksing overall response mula sa lahat. dapat nang bumuo ng risonableng consensus ayon sa iisang stratehiya, at gumalaw ang lahat nang walang pag-aatubili, pangingimi, o hadlang. ikapito: pangunahin sa isang matibay na healthcare system ang pagpapalakas sa mga ospital. siguruhin na equitable at sistematiko ang pagbubuhos ng resources sa mga ospital para makasabay sila sa demands ng pandemya. kung sisilipin ang national data, mukhang hindi pa overburdened ang healthcare system. pero iba ang sinasabi ng mga ospital na nakakasalamuha namin. marami na silang kinakailangang tanggihan dahil wala nang espasyo. natural lang na dapat isaayos ang sistema para makarating ang suporta sa mga lugar na pinaka nangangailangan nito. at ikawalo, para sa ating mga healthcare workers: sila ang nasa pinaka mapanganib na situwasyon, at sila rin ang pinakamahalagang sundalo sa laban kontra covid-19. natural dapat na pagtuonan ng ibayong pansin ang lahat ng pag-aaruga, lahat ng tulong, lahat ng kasangkapan at serbisyong magagamit nila. kabilang na dito ang access sa counseling para sa mga healthcare workers sa mga covid ward. magpatupad din dapat ng sistema para hindi sila maburn-out, tulad ng maayos na proseso ng pagrelyebo. sang-ayon din tayo na dapat maging mas makatarungan ang pasahod sa kanila lalo na sa panahong ganito. ididiin ko lang: pandemya ang ugat ng mga suliranin; kapag mabisa itong matugunan, matutugunan din ang iba pang hamon. conversely: habang dumadami ang nagkaka-covid 19, lalo rin nating pinapatagal ang paghihirap ng pilipino. marami ang namamatay, at hindi sila statistics lang. bawat isa sa kanila, may kuwento, may pangarap; may pamilya sila, may nagluluksa para sa kanila. at habang dumadami sila, lalo lang tayong mahihirapang umusad tungo sa isang better normal—dadami ang mga dadanas ng kahirapan, dadami ang hindi makakaambag sa nation-building, tatagal ang biyahe patungo sa katuparan ng mga pangarap natin. magkakaugnay ang kapalaran ng bawat pilipino. sa ngayon, habang pinagsisikapan nating maampat ang pagkalat ng pandemya, kailangang siguruhin na may sapat na safety nets para sa pinakanangangailangan, habang sinisiguro ding hindi na dadami pa ang mawawalan ng kabuhayan. una sa mga hakbang na maaaring gawin para dito ang pagsasabatas ng stimulus package sa lalong madaling panahon. minumungkahi ng pamahalaan na ipasa ang create bill para ibaba ang buwis ng iba’t ibang kumpanya, para maengganyo ang investors na pumasok sa pilipinas. magandang layunin ito, pero hindi ito sapat. nailatag na naman ng mga ekspertong ekonomista sa kamara sa anyo ng arise bill. kung maisasabatas ito, magkakaroon ng dagdag at tiyak na pondo para sa mga mga programa tulad ng wage subsidies ng dole at cash-for-work ng tupad. malinaw na mas nakatuon sa pinaka nangangailangan ang arise; mas inclusive ito, at mas pro-poor. gamitin sana ang puwersa ng mayorya upang ipasa ang batas sa lalong madaling panahon. ikalawa: puwede ring magbigay ng tax incentives para sa mga kumpanyang magbibigay ng ayuda sa mga apektado ng pandemya. mabisang paraan ito para mailahok ang pribadong sekto sa pambansang pagbabayanihan. ikatlo: gamitin ang buong puwersa ng economic cluster, kasama ng akademya at iba pa mula sa pribadong sektor, hindi lang para magpanday ng mga risk assessment study, pero para tiyakin na nakabatay ang mga desisyon sa pag-aaral na ito. sayang ang kaalaman kung isasantabi lang din natin. kung alam na natin kung alin ang mataas ang peligro, tiyakin nang ieenforce ang mga karagdagang patakaran sa kanila, kung hindi man isususpinde ang pagbubukas. malalaman din natin, mula sa mga industriyang mababa ang peligro, kung anong klaseng skills ang puwedeng pagsanayan ng mga empleyadong hindi kayang mag-work-from-home. pag ma-upgrade ang kanilang kaalaman, mabibigayan sila ng ibang trabaho sa mga industriyang low risk. ikaapat: gumawa na ng buffer stock ng lahat ng mga materyales na kailangan ng bawat pamilya sa panahon ng pandemya: bitamina, sabon, alcohol, face masks, at iba pa. siguruhing hindi maaantala ang supply chain. tutukan ang mga local producers: suportahan sila ng teknolohiya para mas marami pa silang magawa, at mas maraming makabili na gawang lokal. ikalima: atasan ang buong pamahalaan— ahat ng unit at ahensya, mula taas hanggang baba ng burukrasya—na i-patronize ang mga local businesses. i-prioritize ang mga gamit na dito mismo ginagawa sa pilipinas, kahit pansamantala lang. hangga’t maaari rin, i-prioritize ang pagtangkilik sa mga micro, small, and medium enterprises. malaking ambag ang mga ito sa pagsigurong dadaloy ang enerhiya ng ekonomiya sa mga negosyo at komunidad. ikaanim, ukol sa social amelioration program. noong una itong inilunsad, binigyan ng slots ang bawat munisipiyo at lungsod. maraming mga lgu ang namroblema dahil kulang ang binigay sa kanilang slots. kailangang gawing mas sistematiko ito; linisin ang government data, at patalasin ang isang central database para sa poverty statistics. sa ngayon, may iba-ibang registry para sa mga basic sectors, para sa talaan ng maralita, para sa targeting ng mga social protection at social welfare services. pag-isahin ito, i-validate, at ibangga sa talaan ukol sa covid-19, upang matukoy kung sino ang dapat i-prioritize sa sap. sa ganitong paraan, walang palakasan, at mapa-prioritize natin ang mga tunay na nangangailangan. sa mga susunod na panahon, kailangang harapin ang mga suliranin sa ekonomiya. siguruhing matutulungang makabangon muli ang mga nagsarang negosyo, o di kaya mag-engganyo ng pagbubukas ng bago; palakasin ang mga ito, para makalikha ng trabaho. tiyak kong alam ng mga economic managers ang mga hakbang para magawa ito: i-empower ang mga msmes. tutukan ang mga key industries tulad ng agriculture. sang-ayon ako sa plant, plant, plant. ngunit hindi ito sapat. kailangang buhusan ng pondo ang sektor ng agrikultura para sa makabagong kagamitan tulad ng cold storage facilities at drying facilities, at para sa imprastruktura tulad ng farm-to-market roads. mas mainam, mas pangmatagalan, at mas marami ang matutulungan kung nagmumula ang anumang proyekto sa batayang pilosopiya: empowerment ng pilipino para panghawakan ang sarili nilang kapalaran. ang pinakamahalaga: siguruhin na ipapatupad ang mga batas nang patas para sa lahat—nang walang pinapaboran o ginigipit, at nang laging nakatuon sa karaniwang pilipinong makikinabang sa trabaho at kabuhayang malilikha. gaya ng sa ekonomiya at ayudang panlipunan, susunod din ang tugon sa mga hamon sa edukasyon kung maiaayos ang tugon sa mga problemang pangkalusugan. kung maayos ang datos, matutukoy natin nang may kumpiyansa kung saan ligtas magbukas ng mga pampublikong paaralan. para sa mga private schools: now is not the time to burden them with unreasonable restrictions and requirements. ang kailangan nila, tulong at empowerment—hindi patung-patong na papeles para payagan silang magsimula ng distance learning. bukod dito, inihahain din natin ang ilang mungkahi: una, siguruhing mayroong internet hub ang bawat barangay upang magkaroon ng access ang mga estudyanteng walang sariling gadgets sa mga resources na mahahanap online. dito rin sila puwedeng magkaroon ng mga tutor na magiging isa pang antas ng suporta, lalo na kung may puwang sa kaalaman o may ibang kailangang tutukan ang mga magulang. ikalawa, mag-target ng mga pinaka nangangailangang estudyante upang mabigyan ng gadget o device para hindi maantala ang kanilang pag-aaral. ikatlo, capacity building para sa mga teachers. maraming guro ang may malalim na karanasan sa subject matter nila, pero nahihirapang makahabol sa demands ng distance learning. kailangan silang tulungan; kailangang ilapit ang pagsasanay sa kanila, para hindi na ito manganak ng mga puwang sa kaalaman ng mga estudyante. ikaapat: gumawa ng modules na magtuturo sa mga magulang kung paano magsagawa ng home schooling. kasama na dito ang paghahanda ng weekly or monthly curriculum na puwedeng ang magulang mismo ang magturo sa kanilang anak. ikalima: gumawa ng pag-aaral at tukuyin na agad ang mga lugar kung saan walang community transmission ng covid. sa mga lugar na ito, lalo na sa mga mahirap ang internet access, pahintulutan ang limitadong pagtuturo sa mga classroom. ikaanim, para sa mga namatayan: bukod sa karaniwang ayuda tulad ng pagamot at sap, kailangang intindihin ang malawakang epekto sa mga naiwan. dagdag sa pagluluksa, nawalan sila ng breadwinner o nabaon sa utang. kapag pinabayaan natin ang mga naiwan, lalo na ang mga anak na nag-aaral, tatawid sa susunod na henerasyon ang pinsalang dulot ng pandemya. isang paraan para tugunan ito: palawakin ang mga scholarship program para matulungan ang mga tinamaan ng covid: silang napilitang simutin ang ipon, mga nabaon sa utang dahil sa gastos sa ospital, o mga nawalan ng trabaho at kabuhayan. bigyan ng scholarships ang mga namatayan. kailangang tukuyin ang mga dependent ng mga pumanaw, at magbukas ng scholarship fund para sa kanila. malinaw ang pangambang bumabalot sa lahat. kita ito sa mukha ng mga nakasalamuha namin sa ating covid response efforts. binibigkis tayo ngayon ng pangambang ito—pero binibigkis din tayo ng panindigang maalpasan ang ating mga suliranin. idinidiin ng pandemya ang aral: magkakarugtong ang diwa nating lahat. magkakarugtong ang kalusugan at kaligtasan natin, at karugtong naman nito ang bawat aspekto ng buhay natin, mula ekonomiya hanggang edukasyon. nakatahi ang laylayan sa alinmang sentro, mula batanes hanggang jolo. nasa iisang panig tayong lahat, at ang pagkamulat sa katotohanang ito ang susi sa pagharap sa hamon ng covid. nakikita natin ito sa halimbawa ng mga bansang nagkaroon ng mabisang tugon sa pandemya. hindi kalabisang mangarap na kaya rin natin ang ginawa ng taiwan, ng south korea, vietnam, ng new zealand—mga bansang gumawa ng malinaw at tiyak na hakbang, itinuon ang resources sa tunay na kailangan, at nagtulungan. kaya din natin iyon. may sapat tayong kakayahan, sapat dapat na resources, at sapat na kaalaman. malikhain tayo. maabilidad tayo. at sa dinami-dami ng pagsubok na pinagdaanan natin—sa lahat ng sakuna, sa digmaan at diktadurya, sa pananakop—may isang bagay na tiyak: nakaalpas lang tayo dahil hindi tayo nagkanya-kanya; dahil pinalawak natin ang saklaw ng malasakit natin; dahil itinuring nating kakampi ang bawat pilipino, ipinaglaban natin sila, minahal natin sila. nakita ko ito mismo sa napakarami nating mga kababayan na lumapit sa aming tanggapan para magbigay ng donasyon, para mag volunteer na magdala ng ppe at pagkain sa ating mga frontliner, para mag-ambag ng kanilang panahon at talino para makatulong sa gitna ng krisis ng covid. malinaw sa akin, hindi pasaway ang pilipino, kundi laging handang tumulong sa kapwa. hindi inutil ang pilipino, kundi may tapang at talino na humarap sa anumang hamon. hindi talunan ang pilipino. at tiyak na magtatagumpay tayo laban sa pandemyang ito. uulitin ko: kinaya na natin ang marami pang ibang hamon, at kakayanin natin ito.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/hzxeqt/pahayag_ni_vp_leni_robredo_ulat_mungkahi_ukol_sa/,29 07 2020
I drop KDramas when the Philippines is mentioned in a bad light,"don't eat me alive for my opinion. wala lang, parang nawawalan ako ng interes pag imemention nila ang pinas na parang takbuhan ng kriminal ganon (kahit totoo, no?). parang nadidismaya ako. i mean, ang dami ng south koreans na nagpupunta dito to learn english, ang dami din sa kanilang nagstart ng businesses dito, and they make so much money from fans of their celebrities... tapos ang ibabalik sa'tin halos laging negative yung connotation. i think the only half-assed effort i saw their writers do was to mention that the main kontrabida girlies were going off to cebu for a vacay - pero parang hindi sila masyadong excited? yung delivery eh, parang ""it's just a cheap vacation though\~ugh\~""... and cebu is *not* a cheap vacay spot for us naman? like, ang ganda kaya sa cebu? i'm aware naman na hindi lang ph ang namemention nila in a bad light. they also mention other countries like china, sure, pero it kind of puts me off and leaves a sour taste in my mouth when they sprinkle in this detail in their dialogues. of course, favorite theme din naman ng tv shows and movies natin ang social problems and such pero idk basta for me i don't like it when i see it sa kdrama hahaha. aamin ko din, talagang mas maganda naman talaga quality ng stories ng kdramas - i appreciate how they always manage to churn out unique and entertaining shows while following their tried and tested formulas. and i really like the new non-cutesy ones - maybe cos i've graduated from romcoms to thrillers and action shows. wag niyo akong tanungin kung ano yung mga show yung mga drinop ko, nakalimutan ko na titles nila.ang naalala ko lang cloy hahaha! usually fleeting lang naman yung lines na yon pero once kasi na nakita ko, nawawala na talaga interes ko. yun lang po. end rant. :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/180hw6x/i_drop_kdramas_when_the_philippines_is_mentioned/,21 11 2023
Filipino tourists are annoying,"was in japan for solo vacation and the most peaceful i've been was when i was in the countryside away from the hustlin' and bustlin' city. spent my last 10 days of holidays in tokyo and neighbouring places and let me tell you nakakahiya minsan maka-salubong ng kapwa pilipino. - watched the eras tour movie. may group of filipinos. cinema said regular screening lang and advised to sit back and relax and treat the screening like a normal movie. no dancing or singing as to not interrupt fellow guests. guess what they did? humiyaw. sumigaw. i know the artist encourages people to act like they're in a concert pero i think common sense na it still depends on where you are and what rules to follow. - ang ingay sa queue. filipinos lagi malakas boses bukod sa chinese tourists. - i think it's common knowledge na japanese people are quiet in public spaces. mahinhin kumbaga. kaya nakakagulat nung kumakain ako sa food court biglang may nanay na sinisigawan at tinatawag 'yung anak sa kabilang side ng food court good lord - nung nasa airport ako pauwi, gusto ko sana kumain. so umupo ako sa kanto ng big table na may high chairs (table has 8 seats and 'yung talagang meant for sharing and usually mga solo people gumagamit). may family of 4 na naglapag ng gamit sa harap at tabi ko. sinakop 'yung buong lamesa at nag-one seat apart. hindi 'yung 2 sa isang side and 2 sa kabila. 3 nasa isang side and 'yung isang parent sat sa gitna ng kabila. bukod sa akin, wala nang ibang makakaupo. for context, walang masyadong tao sa food area. and as usual, ang lakas ng boses. uutusan ng dad 'yung kid tapos 'pag nasa counter na isisigaw 'yung habol na utos. may kwentong ""'di ko kababayan 'to"" sa sobrang nakakahiya ng actions while travelling rin ba kayo?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/17mu61f/filipino_tourists_are_annoying/,3 11 2023
What does Albularyo do (witch doctor/folk healer)? Do they really do something? May naniniwala pa ba sa kanila in this generation?,"so i have a brother, he's 25 year old. we rushed him twice in the hospital this week. pero prior pa sa mga episodes na'to, he's feeling symptoms already eg. tightness of chest, nagka-cramps ang katawan niya, difficulty sleeping, nahihirapan huminga, etc. after all the medical exams, okay naman lahat ng results niya, normal lahat ng test. a friend of his advised him to go to albularyo (which i am against kasi i think he's having mental health problems talaga which affects he's overall being since yung mga symptoms niya ay linked to anxiety and depression eg. panic attacks/difficulty breathing). but i just let them para sa peace of mind na rin na atleast we all did everything possible kahit na talagang kapos kami, we just don't want him to feel na pinapabayaan namin siya. so fastforward kung saan pumunta yung albularyo sa bahay, wala naman siyang masyadong ginawa. may sinabi na may lumalaro raw sa kapatid ko (nangkukulam daw sa kanya), mas marami pa actually yung pagboboast niya na he's done something for someone, na siya yung reason kung bakit nalaman kung sino yung kumuha sa wallet ng isa niyang pasyente (?). he's just engaging us in the conversation. he also said na yung mga ibibigay niyang papakuluan at iinumin ay exported pa raw and such. and to my surprise p4000 lahat yung siningil niya for that session only. he's not the typical albularyo rin, naka-car siya and mukha namang well-off. do you think reasonable yun as bayad? i mean, may mga naririnig naman na akong albularyo before pero usually hindi ganun kalaki ang hinihingi nila. since parang act of altruism yon in their part since meron silang god-given gift. i don't have anything against sa mga albularyo or naniniwala/nagpeperform nga mga ganoong rituals pero i felt robbed for me and sa kuya ko kasi we chipped in sa bayad. malaking bagay na yon para samin, he's living paycheck to paycheck and i'm still reviewing for my boards so big deal talaga yun sakin. and if ever may magtanong kung bakit hindi ko na lang sinuggest na magvisit ng psychologist. it is still not acknowledge sa amin, especially sa pamilya namin. and simply not accessible. (how can i put it into words) parang still stuck sa phase na ""nasa isip mo lang yan."" bottomline, are albularyos a thing? am i just overreacting sa bayad? edit: i'm reading all your comments guys and i really appreciate them. pero hindi ko lahat ma-process right now kasi my manung just talked to the albularyo, and he's asking him 5k kasi may ritual daw silang gagawin bukas and he's gonna bathe him with god knows what and how, at hindi pa sure kung yun na yung last na hihingin niya. and he assured him daw na 'pag 'di gumaling, ibabalik daw yung binayad. i really can't process anything right now kasi i'm thinking na baka this is only the beginning nung mga paghingi hingi niya, and knowing my brother he really won't listen to any of us. edit: please don't share this with any platform update: i took your advice guys and told him na he should instead see a therapist since malaking bagay yung hinihinging 5k. i also forwarded informative videos na very similar sa mga symptoms na nafifeel niya na linked to anxiety. unfortunately, umutang daw siya ng pambayad and binayaran na niya. and he won't acknowledge yung idea na maybe he has anxiety. sobrang close minded niya with regards doon. i'll just hope and pray for the placebo effect.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/17nhpid/what_does_albularyo_do_witch_doctorfolk_healer_do/,4 11 2023

Why I hate riding the bus in Manila,"had a bad commute day nung isang araw, kaya rant time lang muna ng mga (obvious) reasons why i hate riding the buses in manila 1. usually yung gamit as metro bus ay yung bus na pang field trip, very inefficient. why? isa lang yung pintuan kaya inefficient yung pagbaba at pagsakay ng passengers. tapos sobrang sikip nung aisle at pinupuno masyado ng upuan kaya kapag nagsiksikan, mahirap nang sumakay at bumaba. nakakaawa lang minsan yung mga madaming dala at nakakafrustrate yung hindi pagiging pwd friendly ng ganitong type ng cars 2. cash payment lang at walang beep card (unlike bgc buses and p2p) kaya kapag di ka masyadong nagcocommute, minsan tataasan pa ng kunduktor yung pamasahe. in case na meron naman silang outlet ng beep, hindi naman naka-on, sasabihin sira o kaya cash lang. genuinely curious lang, pero what's stopping them from using beep kahit ilang beses na siyang inattempt dati? 3. pumipigil kahit saan at walang proper bus stops kaya nagcacause sila ng traffic, and sometimes hindi safe yung pagbababaan mo like sa gitna ba naman ng daan 4. hindi aesthetic lol any more reasons?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/16kqsnk/why_i_hate_riding_the_bus_in_manila/,17 09 2023
I wish people will stop adopting kids for the sake of magkaroon ng anak.,"ganito kasi, mga lods. kanina during breakfast, my dad told us na his older sister will officially be disowning her adopted son. well, di naman na minor yun. he's turning 20 this year. my aunt's reason is masyado na raw matigas ang ulo at hindi na makontrol. my dad is with her. sabi pa nga niya, walang utang na loob yung cousin ko lalo pa di naman nga raw namin kadugo pero pinalaki pa rin ni tita. pero iba ang nakikita ko e. my cousin was neglected. sure, pinakain siya at pinag-aral, but he never really had a parent figure. pinapabayaan lang maggala kasi masyadong busy ang parents niya. on top of that, our other cousins dislike him for the obvious reason he's adopted. lagi siyang kinukutsa. kaya di na rin ako nagulat na malayo ang loob niya sa lahat, except sakin. we're not really close talaga, pero kapag nagkasama naman kami (say, sa inuman or nagkasalubong), wala namang awkward air between us (take note: introvert ako, and i'm not close with my other cousins either). then, i remember this one time when our aunt told him right into his face na ""hindi ka kabilang sa pamilya na to"". i was there. kahit ako, nagulat sa sinabi ni tita. we recently talked about it, and he admitted na tumatak sa isip niya iyon. he's just 8 that time (12 naman ako). siguro para sa iba, sasabihin na lang na my cousin should be thankful pa rin dahil nga at least naranasan niya ang buhay marangya. after all, his real parents were just teenagers when he was conceived. pareho pang mahirap. pero ang akin lang, di naman kasi puro pera lang ang kailangan ng isang tao, especially a child. mas matimbang pa rin ang emotional support. kumbaga sa pagbuo ng bahay, it doesn't matter kung gaano kamahal at kaganda ang materyales na gagamitin mo. kung itatayo mo iyan nang walang pundasyon, bibigay din yan agad. ganoon din sa tao. alam nyo napapaisip ako tuloy bigla. what if my cousin was not treated differently? mabait naman kasi siya sa totoo lang. i never understand the hate, lalo na sa mga adult sa pamilya namin (like that tita i mentioned). makulit siguro siya, yes, pero mabait siya. and if my older relatives will just sit down and actually listen to him bago sila magalit, i think madali lang namang malulutas ang problema na to. but nah. we're in the philippines. old people can never be wrong here. sa mga planong mag-adopt dyan, please, pag-isipan n'yo munang mabuti kung talagang kaya n'yo bang panindigan ang responsibilidad sa aampunin n'yo. those children are not toys na kapag nanawa ka, pwede mong i-set aside. tao iyan. and being a parent is a lifelong commitment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/mjmz4i/i_wish_people_will_stop_adopting_kids_for_the/,4 04 2021
I can't handle the noise anymore in our neighborhood.,"around 3-4\~ish months ago, nagpatayo yung kapitbahay namin ng basketball hoop sa tapat rin ng bahay namin. every day after that, hindi na tumigil sa kakalaro yung mga players na dumadayo dito, mostly mga binatilyo and yung mga tricycle drivers. naglalaro sila from bandang mga 4-5pm hanggang 8pm. rinig na rinig dito sa loob ng bahay namin yung dribbling, sigawan ng players, lalo na't halos mga mura pa yung sinisigaw. madalas rin tamaan ng bola yung gate namin at sobrang ingay pag nangyayari yun. nireklamo na to ng tatay ko sa kapitbahay namin ng ilang beses, pero wala naman sila masyadong ginawa para babaan yung noise. napipilitan tuloy akong mag earphones kahit gusto kong tahimik lang, at yung mga magulang ko rin is nahihirapan matulog and madalas magising rin dahil sa ingay. ayaw ipa-baranggay ng mama ko kasi baka daw magalit saamin yung kapitbahay namin tsaka yung mga naglalaro. nakakairita na talaga and hindi ko na talaga kaya yung ingay.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/15z8eek/i_cant_handle_the_noise_anymore_in_our/,23 08 2023

Angkas App problems,"i feel like i fucked up. everyday ko naman ginagamit yung joyride pero ngayon ko lang ito na experience. nag book ako ng isang ride, malapit lang pero tinatamad na ako nun maglakad around 50 pesos lang yung fee, and yung driver na nag pick up nito tinawagan ako immediately after niya kinuha. and he's says, ""ma,am aksidente ko lang po napindot yung accept kung pwede po i-cancel ninyo yung booking, masyadong malayo po ako hindi ko po kayo mapupuntahan"". pagbukas ko ng joyride app ulit may nag flash na message na ""don't accept the rider's plea to cancel bookings you'll lose benefits and will have trouble booking rides in the future"", i'm paraphrasing pero something along those lines. tiningnan ko yung map and true na man yung sinabi ni kuya isang city away pa siya sayang lang ng gas just to accept a 50 pesos fee. ayoko na magkaproblema ako in the future for bookings lalo na na ginagamit ko yung app na toh everyday. so nagsinungaling na lang ako na wala pang lumalabas sa na accepted sa app nag glitch lang sa end niya. sabi niya ok then nag hang up siya after that, dalawang beses niya ulit ako tinawagan pero hindi ko na pinansin yun. naguguilty ako what if ploy lang to ng company para i exploit yung workers nila. or nasuspende/nawalan ng trabaho yung rider na yun dahil lang ayoko ma inconvenience. hindi ko alam if yan yung tamang flair na gagamitin patawad nalang if mali.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/15fgc9x/angkas_app_problems/,1 08 2023

&nbsp; paglilinaw: ang hindrance sa ating progress na humihila sa'tin pababa ay hindi ang criticism o pagpuna sa'ting government officials, kundi ang ating intolerance at galit sa criticism. maganda ang sinabi sa [article na ito](https://www.manilatimes.net/2020/03/19/opinion/columnists/topanalysis/criticizing-as-a-form-of-civic-duty/704176). habang hindi naman tayo gumagawa ng threats o nagdudulot ng harm sa'ting kapuwa, walang masama sa pag-express ng frustrations o konting humor sa mga mali sa ating lipunan at gobyerno. mas ok pa rin yung aware tayo kesa magpikit mata tayo na parang mas mahal na natin ang isang public servant kaysa sa bayan. balansihin din natin. hindi ito pagrebelde o pakikipaglaban sa gobyerno, kundi pag-call out ng inefficiencies at incompetence, at pagsuporta na rin sa checks and balances ng ating lipunan para hindi maabuso ang kapangyarihan. at hindi komo nagrereklamo, hindi ibig sabihin wala tayong ibang ginagawa. si leni nga andaming reklamo ng lugaw na yan, pero halos araw-araw ring nagtrabaho simula day 1. ang gusto lang namin kay leni, kahit kailan hindi siya pagalit mag-voice out ng criticism at malumanay siyang nagbibigay ng suggestions for improvement. kaya marami rin ang akala ay mahina at walang political will si leni kasi malumanay siya. pero hindi siya mahina kundi matapang. isipin mo, presidente na mismo ang pinupuna niya, kahit alam niya ang negative effect sa image at popularity niya dahil alam naman niya ang kultura nating mga pinoy na napaka-allergic sa criticism. kita naman natin ang backlash sa facebook posts niya na flooded ng laugh reacts at toxic comments. pero bakit ba talaga si leni nagvo-voice out? ramdam niya ang mga hinanakit ng taong bayan kasi andun siya mismo parati sa ground at may kamalayan siya sa kalagayan ng mga tao. like yung pag-una pa sa dolomite sand, sabi niya ito raw ay [insensitive](https://mb.com.ph/2020/09/08/manila-bay-white-beach-an-insensitive-plan-in-time-of-pandemic-solon/) kasi magbuhos sana dapat muna ng lahat ng resources at attention sa pandemic, which is a valid point 'di ba? dahil alam niyang kapag mas mabilis maka-return to normal ang labor force natin, mas mabilis aangat muli ang ekonomiya natin. &nbsp; ##2. puppet si leni ng oligarchs! &nbsp; paglilinaw: unlike sa panahon ni cory na may injustices laban sa mga magsasaka, kahit bago pa si leni tumakbo for any public office, no political plans or agenda, bilang lawyer ay mahusay niyang ipinagtanggol na pro bono (walang bayad) ang maraming marginalized sectors. halimbawa ay ang paglaban niya para sa mga lupa ng sumilao farmers against sa conglomerate by the name of san miguel corporation. naipanalo nila ang kaso laban sa mga elite. kaya hindi nakakapagtaka kung bakit todo ang suporta sa kaniya ng mga [sumilao farmers](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/779322/sumilao-farmers-to-march-not-for-land-but-for-robredo). iba iba rin ang ugali ng individual na members ng mga partido, hindi lahat masama o lahat mabuti. halimbawa, sina cory at duterte ay parehas na kabilang sa pdp-laban, na sinimulan naman ni ninoy. kakapalit lang din ni sara recently. makikita rin natin sa saln ni leni na hindi siya kasing yaman ng most politicians, kaya noong sinampahan siya ng kaso ni bbm, may volunteers na nagbuo ng [crowdfunding campaign](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/803171/piso-para-kay-leni) to support her legal fees. anong ginawa niya? at her own personal risk, she politely declined to avoid graft at ipinamahagi lahat ng funds sa angat buhay program, especially sa housing projects sa marawi. see [here](https://gogetfunding.com/piso-para-sa-laban-ni-leni/) for more details. also search for ""jeanette concepcion patindol piso para kay leni"" on facebook. this speaks volumes about her integrity. isa pa, her office consistently received the highest audit rating from coa for [3 straight years](https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2021/6/29/ovp-highest-audit-rating-coa-third-straight-year-.html). ilang beses na tayong umasa sa mga napakagandang pangako ng mga politiko, so it might help if i-apply natin ito sa **lahat** ng ating candidates: kahit gaano kaganda ang mga pangako, plano, at plataporma ng kahit sinong candidate, kahit gaano kagaling siyang magsalita, ka-inspiring ang kaniyang vision, at katindi ng kaniyang political will, ang mas reliable indicator ng kanilang totoong character ay hindi ang kanilang words, hindi rin ang words para sa kanila ng naging allies nila or ng sikat na vloggers or influencers, kundi ang kanilang **past actions**. she takes quick actions. at ang lahat ng ginawa niya bilang vp ay **initiatives** lang niya o kusang loob—hindi part ng mandates ng ovp—dahil siya ay isang servant leader. &nbsp; ##3. history is written by the victors!

band-aid solution. di yan para sa long-term progress ng bansa natin! &nbsp; paglilinaw: hindi naman dahil nag-take siya ng initiatives na tumulong ay ibig sabihin noon ay wala siyang kamalayan sa long-term na makakatulong sa economic growth. hindi vp ang nagco-control ng spending natin sa infrastructure. pero graduate si leni ng economics sa up diliman. alam niya ang kahalagahan ng infrastructure kaya itutuloy niya ang [build, build, build](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2021/10/29/2137559/robredo-says-continue-anti-drug-campaign-build-build-build-tweaks?fbclid=iwar12u_l5gubhl7f35bzxzqyu3esc2t965enw7pwpvyxzyhdzq_zfjhiff6s) pero makikinig din siya sa ating best civil engineers para ma-address for example ang ating traffic and congestion sa urban areas. nakita rin natin ang kaniyang efficient management of resources at [achievements](https://www.reddit.com/r/leni2022/comments/qkl0wk/megathread_achievements_and_statements_of_maria/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) as vp kahit relatively maliit ang budget na inilaan sa ovp. at makikinig din siya sa mga experts and our best economists. ang kaibahan sa kaniya, mas confident tayo na hindi niya nanakawan ang kaban ng bayan. alam din natin na maglalagay siya ng professional leaders na nararapat sa bawat department, hindi yung nilagay lang dahil sa pabor o para ma-enforce ang kapangyarihan. &nbsp; ##5. bayaran ang media! &nbsp; paglilinaw: oo, hindi perfect ang media, pero unlike most vloggers na clearly biased, ang media ay much more under threat na mahabla o maaaring makulong kung lumabag ito sa batas. let me illustrate: in case lang naman na sobra kang amazed o hanga kay bbm for ""his"" bangui windmill farm, let's get the facts right. oo, ina-acknowledge natin na he eagerly permitted, facilitated, and inaugurated its construction according to [this opinion piece](https://manilastandard.net/mobile/article/367795). similar to his parents, alam niya kung gaano kalakas ng hatak ng votes ng sights of [big infrastructures](https://opinion.inquirer.net/145027/our-infrastructure-fetish). gamit na gamit nga sa campaign niya halos lahat ng videos ay may kasamang windmill animation. pero tandaan din na ito ay initiated, constructed, and financed not by the government but by the **private sector**. for complete details, see [here](https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=assvkrokksyc&pg=pa83&hl=en&sa=x&ved=2ahukewjdv8ywinvzahuugkykhfugabcq6af6baggeai#v=onepage&q&f=false). pag binasa natin 'yon, si **ferdinand dumlao** ang isa sa nag-initiate ng bangui windmill farm. ngayon itong si **thinking pinoy** inaakusahan niya na mali mag fact-check si rappler. ang claim kasi ni tp ay yung bangui windmill farm ay initiated by bbm dahil si dumlao daw kasi ang ""ilocos norte's provincial special projects manager"" ni bbm. watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bghpacxoxh4&t=14m00s&feature=youtu.be) at the 14:00 mark. pero magkaibang dumlao kasi 'yon. ang under ni bbm ay **hindi** si ferdinand dumlao kundi si **chito** dumlao. read [here](https://www.manilatimes.net/2004/11/23/news/regions/bongbong-furious-at-ilocos-norte-killing-spree/683199). at ang daming naloloko. tandaan, **hindi** reliable source ang napakaraming facebook, youtube, and tiktok videos dahil punong puno ito ng propaganda, ilang taon na. wala sila madalas na reference na binibigay, puro accusation at stories. at kung may reference gaya ni thinking pinoy, mina-manipulate nila to fit their narratives. hindi naman masyadong mahirap pag-isipan kung saan nanggaling ang makinarya ng propaganda. tsaka yung iba rin ay nare-reinforce nalang ng positive feedback ng community nila at ng [dunning kruger effect](https://www.britannica.com/science/dunning-kruger-effect#:~:text=dunning%2dkruger%20effect%2c%20in%20psychology,or%20of%20people%20in%20general). tapos magke-claim ang mga apologist na bayaran ang rappler at abs-cbn na nag-report din naman sa katiwalian under the aquinos at previous admins gaya ng sa mendiola—see this [report by rappler](https://www.rappler.com/nation/mendiola-massacre-anniversary-same-injustices). *hmm... sino kayang candidate na kabaliktaran ni cory at [ipinagtanggol](https://www.manilatimes.net/2016/04/13/news/top-stories/sumilao-farmers-choose-leni/255921) ang mga farmers at mga mahihirap laban sa mga elite?* since they cannot attack the evidence, their tactic is to target the sources (media) at siraan sila. kaya wag naman tayo masyado padala sa mga sikat na influencers gaya ni ka tunying, yung inc na vlogger. ok sana kung mag-cite siya ng sources, kaya lang kadalasan ay chismis style lang. pero mabait naman siya, misinformed nga lang din at feel niya pinagtutulungan siya kaya para sa kaniya, masama tayong lahat. valid naman ang point niya, wag dapat ipairal ang galit. &nbsp; ##edit: i had an idea. what if ang volunteer animators natin ay bumuo ng inspiring video animation, na may nagna-narrate using this explanation? kahit yung 1st, 2nd, at 4th misconceptions lang. para pati yung mga tinatamad magbasa ay ma-enlighten. baka may ma-contact kayo. yung with inspiring music gaya ng kay william capistrano et al. tapos gawing ad. suggestion lang naman. 🙂 &nbsp; **sa counterarguments:** feel free to comment your criticisms and counterarguments. please include suggestions so we can engage in civil discourse at ma-edit and improve pa natin itong mga paglilinaw. &nbsp; **sa gustong mag-contribute ng sarili nilang paglilinaw sa comments:** use this format. *misconception:* *paglilinaw:* &nbsp; **sa mga bukas ang mata:** alam nating she is facing an uphill battle for our nation. kaya nananawagan ako na habang may oras pa, tumindig tayo at humakbang para sa bayan. sa kabila ng takot, sa gitna ng magulong politika at malakas na ingay ng propaganda, let us amplify [the voice of reason](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/mobile/folders/19vdfrfqgfboq0kwqcdiuqydtn_dsoaal?usp=drive_fs) at ating patunayan ang ating malasakit sa bayan.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/qx82zk/replying_to_misinformation_against_leni/,19 11 2021
"Ayoko na, pagod na ako.","sobrang gulo ng isip ko. kakagraduate ko lang noong june 5 until now wala pa rin akong mahanap na work. alam ko na at fault din ako kasi 3 lang yung inapplyan ko, pero lately, nawawalan talaga ako ng gana mag-apply. hindi ko mafigure out kung ano yung gusto kong gawin. mga 2nd week ng june, nagtry ako maging ugc creator, failed. recently naman (last week), nagtry ako mag luto ng almusal dito sa amin. kumikita naman kaso pa-100 lang. hindi sapat to cover our living expenses. take note, naka partial live in ako sa boyfriend ko, wala siyang work pero may diskarte siya na easy money kaso yung huling success niya sa diskarte na yun ay noong may 30 pa before ako mag graduation kasi supposedly para sa panghanda ko yung money na yun, although naubos lang din and kinakailangan niya mag sanla ulit para makapag bigay sa graduation ko (na hindi ko naman pinilit). i appreciate it tho kaso recently nasusumbat niya sakin yun. minsan nasasabihan niya ako na wala akong kwenta kasi wala akong pera/wala akong work. i feel like a burden to him, altho wala naman siya masyadong financial problem bukod sa naka sanla lang yung alahas niya at tutubo na this month (yung pangalawang reason bakit nakapag sanla ulit siya ng alahas dahil nangutang ako 2k sa kaniya to do ugc, kaso sinanla niya ng parang 7k o 8k so siya rin nakaubos in short). while ako naman, unemployed pero everyday nakakapag provide ako ng food namin, ako rin nagbabayad ng bills, etc. since last year siguro ako nagshoshoulder ng bills, pero lagi niya sinasabi na hinahatian daw niya ako kahit hindi naman. anyway, so yun na nga nagtitinda ako ng almusal, nagtitiis ako in short. i know that there are a lot of opportunities out there pero nacacalm ako kapag nagluluto ako. altho naprepressure ako kasi parang lahat ng tao dito minamadali ako magkawork especially yung boyfriend ko. today, nakapag tinda ako ng almusal kaso hindi naubos. another incident ng kapalpakan ko, yung requirements na ginawa ko para sa diskarte niya, may mali. sobrang nagalit na naman siya sakin, in the end pinaalis niya ako sa property namin na tinutuluyan niya at pinauwi niya ako sa bahay namin kasi ayaw niya ako makita dahil sa sobrang inis niya dahil sa kabobohan ko. magkalapit lang ung property namin na tinutuluyan niya at yung bahay namin. right now, i feel like shit. hindi ko alam gagawin. hindi naubos paninda ko, palpak yung nagawa ko na requirements, wala pa tumatanggap sa akin na work, wala na kami pera for tomorrow (kahit for later wala rin), at higit sa lahat baon ako sa utang. gusto ko nalang kunin ako ni lord. hindi ko alam gagawin. i mean sige given na mag appy ako, mag ayos ako, pero tangina parang lugmok na lugmok ako to the point na gusto ko nalang mamatay. madalas si mama palagi rin ako sinisigawan o pinapagalitan, tapos pag may narinig na pagalit o pamumuna yung boyfriend ko galing sa mama ko regarding sa akin, gagatungan pa niya. help please help. i'm so close para uninom ulit ng zonrox or ano pa man. madalas gusto ko nalang saksakin sarili ko kasi puro ako kapalpakan, wala pa kwenta, burden, lahat na!!!!!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/14q5s33/ayoko_na_pagod_na_ako/,4 07 2023

My mother's current situation at St. Lukes.,"i really need to ask for everyone's insight/recommendations in this subreddit kasi hindi ko na talaga alam ang gagawin ko sa sitwasyon namin ngaun. initially kasi, ung kapitbahay namin kinumbinse ang mama ko na may diabetes na magpacheck up sa st. lukes kasi wala daw silang binayaran sa pagpapatingin at opera sa kanya dahil may maxicare sya. ako naman pumayag kasi dependent ko si mama sa hmo ko sa work at malaking tulong nga talaga ung walang babayaran. aside from that, naging masama na talaga ung nararamdaman ni mama at gusto na nya magpatingin dahil may sugat sya sa hinliliit nya sa paa at un ang nagcacause ng panghihina nya. fast forward anduon na kami sa office ng doctor at nung pagkakita nya sa paa ng mama ko, minadali na nya kaming ipa admit ang mama ko (note na wala talaga ako masyadong alam about confinement at nataranta na rin ako kaya pumayag na ako ipa admit sya sa st lukes). fast forward ng dalawang araw at naka schedule na si mama for operation sa kanyang paa. kinabukasan ininspect ng surgeon ung paa at merong parts na naging necrotic. minessage ako ng pinsan ko kasi nalaman nya ung nangyari kay mama at ininform ko sa kanya na may confidence pa nga na wala naman kaming babayaran kasi may hmo si mama pero inutusan nya ako na magparunning bill (hindi ko nga alam tong term na ito eh dahil wala talaga akong knowledge about hospitalization). inexplain nya na gawin ko daw un or else magugulat na lang ako sa bill namin. kinabukasan dimiretso ako sa billing department ng hospital at nag request ng soa at putangina nagulat ako dahil sa tatlong araw ng pag stay ni mama sa ospital 300k+ na agad ung bill! natulala ako nun for a good minute at dumiretso ako sa maxicare para magask ng options (kung pwede ipaincrease ung limit or kung pwede ipatong ung limit ko sa limit ng mama ko) pero negative. fast forward sa 2nd operation ni mama at kinabukasan ininspect ulit at may parts ulit na necrotic at duon na kami binigyan ng option na putulin ung paa nya. ang kinaiinis ko pa dito bakit hindi na lang nila inadvise na iamputate in the first place (although ayaw ko naman mangyari un dahil napaka morbid) pero sinabi naman nila na ayaw nila mapunta sa pagputol at itry na isave ung paa as much as possible. i get that pero wala kaming financial capacity na sagutin ung bill. ang intention ko lang naman is mapatingin sya at magkaroon ng mabilis na operation na macocover ng hmo nya pero hindi un ang naging case. fast forward sa present, nakausap ko na ung doctor at sinabi ko na nakapagdecide na kami ng mama ko na putulin na lang ung paa nya para hindi na kumalat pa ung impeksyon at dahil 800k na ung tanginang bill namin. kaya ito ako ngaun humihingi ng recommendation/advice kung anong pwedeng gawin in case hindi masolusyunan ng medical assistance sa government/politicians. base sa mga research ko against the law na magdetain ng patients due to non payment. pero ang magiging loophole nila samin ay ang room namin initially ay private kasi ayun ang sabi ng maxicare na covered nila at wala naman sa isip ko na ilagay kami sa ward dahil mahina ang diskarte ko sa hospital. **tl;dr** ang ineexpect kong free of charge appoinment sa st. lukes ay napunta sa malaginto na bayarin kaya nanghihingi ako ng advice kung ano pwedeng gawin para hindi makulong ang nanay ko sa ospital dahil wala kami pambayad sa bill. edit: nasa ward naman na kami ngaun kaya sana bigyan kami ng consideration despite admitting in a private room initially na inoffer ng maxicare. ***update*** nakausap ko na ung sa billing may pinagusapan kaming options. ang ayaw ko lang naman talaga kasi na mangyari eh idetain kami dito sa hospital dahil hindi kami makakabayad in full. payag naman ako sa installment plan pero wala daw ganung option. sinabi ko naman ung storya ko na napaagree lang naman kami sa st lukes dahil inassure ng kapitbahay na wala naman kaming gagastusin and kasi akala ko saglit lang si mama duon at simple lang ung operation pero nagtagal sya at lumobo na ung bill. i expected na macocover lahat ng charges gamit ung hmo ng mama ko pero hindi pala. so ayun tinanong nya sakin na kinonsider ko daw ba na lumipat sa ibang hospital. sinabi ko nasa isip ko naman un pero ano ba ung magiging process? kailangan ba bayaran muna ung bill dito bago malipat? wala syang dinisclose duon kasi ung management nya lang daw ung makakapag decide. so nung narinig ko un medj gumaan ung loob ko dahil parang may loophole. so tinanong ko ano po ba ung magiging repercussions kapag lumipat ako ng hospital at hindi ko mababayaran ung bill sa st lukes which is hindi naman talaga kaya. sabi nya possible na mangyari is ma-ban kami sa st lukes. edi ok lang. wala naman talaga kami mababayad kahit pigain nila kami at kahit anong gagawin nilang pagdetain samin lolobo lang ung amount ng bill na hindi namin mababayaran. kaya kung i restrict/ban nila kami due to non payment edi go. hindi ko naman ginusto na pumunta sa st lukes balak ko naman talaga is sa pgh or kahit anong government hospital. sadyang nakumbinse lang ng kapitbahay.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/y1b76n/my_mothers_current_situation_at_st_lukes/,11 10 2022

* few families control most land * malamang sa malamang ang interes nila ay panatilihin ang ganitong status * either occupied nila ang mga high level public offices or sila ang mga primary backers and clients ng mga taong nakaupo (alongside financial moguls at malalaking companies- sila-sila lang naman ang trinity na gumagabay sa ekonomiya ng pilipinas, no such thing as socialized industry and fair bargaining dito) * siyempre ang mga agri-lords natin hindi mag-iintroduce ng land reform na gagawin silang kapantay na lamang ng mga mabababang uri in a real material sense * ""negotiate"" (stronghand) nila na panatilihing mababa ang mga sahod ng mga agriworkers, oldest trick in da buk * mabagal ang pag-industrialize ng agricultural sector sa bansa kasi hindi afford ng pangkaraniwang magsasaka ang sarili nilang production necessities * magdodonate ng farming equipments ang mga may ari ng farming land, pero paunti-unti lang, hindi exponential o trend-setting * hindi masyadong tumataas ang yields kaya kaylangan talaga mag import ng foreign agricultural products * sabayan mo pa ng inflation at mas tumataas na pagtangkilik sa imports, pangkain lang ang kinikita ng mga magsasaka lalo pang pumapailalim at nadudurog * dahil walang industrialization drive, at puro mahihirap din ang lower middle class sa provinces at maging sa mga metropolitan area, kahit sa labas ng gobyerno walang makakapag-fund sa mga efforts na i-incentivize ang transformation ng agricultural sector sa pinas (di tulad sa ibang bansa na nakakapag-raise sila ng many millions para sa mga funds at causes) * walang pumapasok na pera para sa causes ng pagbabago, kaya mahina ang kapangyarihan ng mga peasants kung subukan man nilang mag-organize, yung mga advocacy nila nananatiling tahimik, at minsan iniislander pa at nireredtag kasi totoo naman na taliwas sa pagpapanatili ng mga ""fundamental social, economic and political structures"" ang solusyong hinihingi nila * same thing din sa negligible na industrial economy natin, hindi talaga mainanationalize o maisosocialize kasi merong mga may social at political status na matatamaan pag iniangat ng estado ang kapangyarihan ng mga manggagawa upang mamili ng economic projects na pabor sa nakararami * ang dominant na financial sector (mga bangko, etc) sa pilipinas, mas lalo namang dependent sa mga bulsa ng mga ubod ng yaman * gagamitin pa ng mga superior players ang retorika ng eco-friendly policies para idistract ang mga medyo may malay na pilipino mula sa mga kinakailangang makatao na socioeconomic changes (ang irony ay patuloy parin namang bulok ang public transportation natin kaya ang mga pinoy bili ng bili ng fossil fuel automobiles at dagdag congestion, patuloy ang pag-tangkilik sa emissions na siyang wawasak din sa kanila, et cetera) magiging endless cycle to hanggang may violent social rupture talaga na mangyari kapag hindi na nakayanan, at magpatuloy na ang pag-abante ng kasaysayan sa isinumpang bansa natin na ito. at mark my words, hindi tayo makakasabay sa pagworsen ng climate disasters. yung mga innovations na kakailanganin we will not be able to fund from our own pockets as a society habang tuyong-tuyo tayo dahil sa mga bampirang humihigop sa bunga ng pawis ng lipunan natin. kung ikaw ay may anak o plano magkaroon, pag-isipan mo kung meron kang etikal na responsibilidad na ipaalam sa kanila kung ano ang naging takbo ng mundo mula noong simula palang, kung saan ito sana nagtungo at dapat patungo. hindi dapat sila maging ""kontento na"" at sunud-sunuran. kailangan mainstill sa mga susunod na henerasyon kung ano ang posibleng maaccomplish gamit ang mga resources sa panahon na ginagalawan nila. tulad ng mga slogans ng mga call center companies, kailangan maging disruptive at contrarian para makapag-adapt. kung kinakailangang ihatid sa huling hantungan ang mga nakagawiang pananaw at pagpapahalagang pilipino-katoliko, so be it. yan lang muna. salamat.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/zc2dtl/ano_ba_talaga_ang_kalagayan_ng_pilipinas_ganto/,4 12 2022
Wondering lang paano trato sa inyo ng company nyu this pandemic,"nasabi ko lang to since i think our company is a bit unfair. a bit lang naman. ang workplace ko ay nasa manila pero nakatira ako sa probinsya malapit lapit sa manila. dahil sa covid, walang masyadong transpo. dati 1 bus lang sakay tapos lrt ngayon ilang sakay since p2p at uv lang available masakyan at napakalayo pa ng terminal sa bahay namin. mas malaki gastos sa pamasahe at mas matagal ang travel time. wala sana tong masyadong problema kung kagaya ng dati ang working hours na flexi time (maaga ka pumasok maaga ka rin makakauwi). ngayon fixed time na 5 pm uwi kahit mas maaga ka pumasok di ka pwede lumabas till 5 pm. also, since enforced pa rin na 50% lang tao sa office, hinati kami at alternate per week. kumbaga 50% this week sa office tapos next week wfh sila at iba naman ang nasa office. again, okay sana to. kaso... malayo nga ang tirahan ko at di kaya ng budget na mag apartment. noong kalahati ng 2020 na ganito ang working arrangement ay pumayag si company na mag stay in sa office ung ibang employees. malaki ang company at may mga rooms na pwede naman istayan. the case lang ay di na ngayon pumayag kaya at loss ako saan magstay for the meantime. hindi namin alam bakit hindi na pwede ngayon na kahit before ay pinayagan kami. magbabago na rin ang working arrangement kung saan di na weekly ang alternate pero every other day na. again, wala sana tong problema masyado kung may byahe na (yung mga bus na derecho sana) at flexi ang oras para di lang sabay sa dagsa ng mag uuwian ang pagbyahe pauwi sana. wala naman ni-provide si company na any assistance regarding sa byahe, allowance or anything. hindi naman sa nag eexpect ako pero alam naman nilang mahirap sa ngayon ang situation pero di nila kinoconsider ang aming position and kakayanan. hindi ko masabi ang buo pangyayari pa at ayaw ko sana malaman kung ano yung company ko dahil may post na dito sa reddit before about sa treatment nila na bigla nalang din nawala. so ayun gusto ko lang mag-rant. i hope na okay kayong lahat this time. stay safe po.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ktohs3/wondering_lang_paano_trato_sa_inyo_ng_company_nyu/,9 01 2021
My dad got roasted by the family for pointing out there are many people who died from heart attack than covid19,"hindi naman covid19 denier ang papa, but he's underestimating this virus too much. and just last night, my mom and younger sister got angry to him for pointing out that there are many people who died from heart attack than covid19. ang topic kasi namin ay yung pagkamatay ng pinsan ko sa covid19. my mom and sister are partly blaming him and his dad for denying it. then, my dad is like, ""totoo ang covid19 pero masyado pa rin naman tayong oa,"" because half of our clan got infected already but only one died so far (si cousin), and dahil pa ""raw"" sa cardiac arrest, rather than covid19 itself. so mom and sis got ballistic, and began pointing out why we should still be careful now that the pandemic is still going on. some of their pointers are: 1. heart attack is normally caused by lifestyle, and unlike covid19, hindi siya nakakahawa. \[and on cousin's case, yes, cardiac arrest ang pumatay, but the virus still played a factor, so it's still counted as caused by covid-19.\] 2. sars-cov-2 is still a pretty new pathogen, at hindi pa fully understood ng scientists ang virus na ito, which will lead to third point... 3. unlike heart attack na marami nang procedure para mapigilan ang pagkamatay, wala pa masyadong kunkretong procedure ang mga doctor natin para sa malalang kaso. 4. and lastly, related to first point, since it is a transmissible disease, hindi lang dapat sarili natin ang iniisip natin. some people out there have weaker immune system. pwedeng hindi ka nga maapektuhan masyado, but what about the others? i was just silently giggling the whole time they're lecturing my dad. my mom and sister are normally submissive kasi, and i guess it caught my dad off guard kasi natahimik bigla. i think it's the time for us to be more aggressive on educating people. almost two years na ang virus. habang tumatagal, mas nararamdam na ang gravity, especially in terms of financial. i have aunt who used to be so rich kasi may ari sila ng malaking resort. now, she's closed to being bankrupt dala ng lockdown. i know it's primarily the fault of the government, but after seeing a recent news of people claiming covid-19 is not true, i could not help but wonder if we aren't educating people well enough as well. bukod sa maraming denier, nagkalat na naman ang mga fake medical tips na pinasimunuan ng mga ganid na kapitalista (looking at you, cooper mask and ivermectin).",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/prlmnb/my_dad_got_roasted_by_the_family_for_pointing_out/,20 09 2021

A close encounter with COVID-19.,"guys, just want to share my personal experience. do not let your guard down even with friends or relatives, especially if you have elderly, children or sickly family members. the short story is that i have three siblings, girls ages 17 (twins) and 12, who have been staying with me for more than a year and a half now because our mom is sumakabilang bahay. their dad died in 2017. i have another brother from the same mother, he is 18 years old recently graduated from senior high. i did not take him in cause of a few reasons. one, i have an ate 30 and another brother who is 22 who are capable of taking him in. i already have three girls with me and it's more than what i can handle already. second, i know he can't be contained meaning lakwatsero so he's a real risk for us especially that i have a baby aged 1 and a half. three, he's annoying. however, recently, naawa ako. i am usually mataray and masungit sa kanya, just to push him away. i am a realy push over and minsan hindi ako makatiis so this is how i cope with it na i pretend to be masama, mataray and masungit so people won't ask me for favors. august, naawa ako sa kanya and he really has no place to say. my brother and sister who were supposed to take him in, both are selfish in their own right, all in all walang kwenta. so i let him stay. he has a bike so sideline niya is delivery so i let him. i also have a bike and i also deliver my selling goods so i know to just disinfect, keep your distance and minimal contact. i let him stay at our house, he's staying at the part of our living room that nobody goes to and is right infront of our other door for entrance. for the rest, yes, he's using our utensils, bathroom, kitchen, etc. this was a big mistake for me. come his birthday, end of august, i bought him some food and a cake and after that he ate and run. i said, if you're leaving this house, you're not coming back. he said yes. i told him good. but then, my fiance, also a big push over, opened the door when my brother knocked. i told him, why did you let him in? he said well nakakaawa. i said my sister should be responsible in finding a place for him, not us and he said just let him stay it's okay with me. so i did. after three days, nawalan ng panlasa. i knew it, he threw his friends a birthday party and probably they were drinking. i said get out of this house and get picked up by the barangay elsewhere. he asked me what he should do, i said i already told you what to do. i told you to stay indoors right? now, i don't care just leave. i have young siblings here, i have a baby, my fiance is very sickly since he was a kid, i have my step mother who has asthma and is very sick, we have a tenant upstairs who has a baby as well. my sister also called and i told her i told you. why did you let him stay here with us when you know we are at risk. she claimed that she did not know that he was staying here. we disinfected the entire house. i threw out his clothes to the garage and everything he had used. we used up all the chlorine and alcohol that we had. even doing that felt pointless. we were already exposed. we used the same utensils, we used the same door handles, the same bathroom, he touched the refrigirator, the dining table and chairs, everything. all i can do was pray. after 8 days, he tested positive for covid. he currently remains asymptomatic aside for the loss of senses such as taste and smell. we did not get any tests done because none of us experienced any symptoms. it's been more than 15 days since. we are all fine. but the entire time, i was really... mad. for his birthday, he put other people at risk, his own family. i threw him a small birthday party and it was not enough for him. i said, he could have lived with me until the end of the pandemic and i would not mind. he could have ate and slept here for free but he chose to have a good time with his friends in exchange for our health and safety. guys, don't let anyone into your home. do not feel safe, not even with your own family. this was a close call. i will never put my family at risk again just because i feel like i am selfish by not letting someone in. it's been 20 days since and we are healthy and fine. even my father, my step mother, my other siblings, my in laws who were exposed because they visited while my brother was still here, our tenants. no one got sick. i would not know what to do if we contracted covid-19. it was an excruciating two weeks for me, not knowing what is going to happen.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/itfju1/a_close_encounter_with_covid19/,15 09 2020
Filipino tourists are annoying,"was in japan for solo vacation and the most peaceful i've been was when i was in the countryside away from the hustlin' and bustlin' city. spent my last 10 days of holidays in tokyo and neighbouring places and let me tell you nakakahiya minsan maka-salubong ng kapwa pilipino. - watched the eras tour movie. may group of filipinos. cinema said regular screening lang and advised to sit back and relax and treat the screening like a normal movie. no dancing or singing as to not interrupt fellow guests. guess what they did? humiyaw. sumigaw. i know the artist encourages people to act like they're in a concert pero i think common sense na it still depends on where you are and what rules to follow. - ang ingay sa queue. filipinos lagi malakas boses bukod sa chinese tourists. - i think it's common knowledge na japanese people are quiet in public spaces. mahinhin kumbaga. kaya nakakagulat nung kumakain ako sa food court biglang may nanay na sinisigawan at tinatawag 'yung anak sa kabilang side ng food court good lord - nung nasa airport ako pauwi, gusto ko sana kumain. so umupo ako sa kanto ng big table na may high chairs (table has 8 seats and 'yung talagang meant for sharing and usually mga solo people gumagamit). may family of 4 na naglapag ng gamit sa harap at tabi ko. sinakop 'yung buong lamesa at nag-one seat apart. hindi 'yung 2 sa isang side and 2 sa kabila. 3 nasa isang side and 'yung isang parent sat sa gitna ng kabila. bukod sa akin, wala nang ibang makakaupo. for context, walang masyadong tao sa food area. and as usual, ang lakas ng boses. uutusan ng dad 'yung kid tapos 'pag nasa counter na isisigaw 'yung habol na utos. may kwentong ""'di ko kababayan 'to"" sa sobrang nakakahiya ng actions while travelling rin ba kayo?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/17mu61f/filipino_tourists_are_annoying/,3 11 2023
My thanksgiving dinner experience with a BBM family.,"so eto nga guys, nag-punta kami (me (f), my wife (f) my sister and her bf) reluctantly sa invitation ng ilocano-bbm tita na kapit-bahay namin. may pinag-samahan naman yung family kahit papano, before elections super ganda ng communication namin sa kanila kasi kapitbahay namin dito sa canada. saktong usapan lang, nag-dasal kami bago kumain. to be honest, ang ganda nung prayer. as an agnostic, na-appreciate ko naman siya. pero gagi, yung kapatid ko brining-up yung pag-unfriend ko sa tito ko na misogynistic bbm supporter din tapos sabi sakin bigla nung bbm na tita: ""kayo kasi maka-leni kayong lahat diba? dapat di na kayo nagpapa-niwala sa kwento kwento lang. dapat sa totoong news sources lang."" mind you, binigyan ko lang siya nuon ng heads-up na fake yung website source niya (halatang fake kasi no actual sources from credible organizations, news sites, people, also the ones she sent me usually walang https:// (unsecure-doesnt mean all with https:// are legit as well) tapos yung design nung buong site, parang cult na may agila, illuminati sht - web designer and dev ako) tapos kinimkim pala niya yun. di ko nalang tinuloy yung pag-rebut ko kasi yung wife ko natatakot na magalit ako. i was very polite about it kasi mas matanda siya sakin and i was just looking out for her. then na-bring up nanaman ng kapatid ko about yung recently nangyari kay leila de lima. gagi nagulat ako sabi ng panganay niyang babae, ""dapat pinatay na nila yun. tinuluyan na dapat sinaksak."" sabay silang pamilyang tumawa (aside sa bunso na awkward sa situation) i felt chills. paanong nakakapag-dasal ng ganun kaganda tapos without any hesitations, would wish harm on other people just like that. ps. sinabihan din nung bbm tita yung mom ko directly bakit ako nag-cocomment and nag-popost na kumakalaban sa views niya. tas sabi ni bbm tita ""isang post mo nalang eh sasampalin na kita."" sabay tawa. eto din isang kinagalit ko sila yung traditional toxis filipino family. lakas nilang i-body shame yung asawa ko sa harap ko? muntik na talaga nag-liparan ang mga lumpia. anyways, officially cut ties with them na. may bbm supporter akong mga kakilala pero not that extreme (madalas dahil lang kasi ilocano. &nbsp; &nbsp; (edit) just to answer some questions. &nbsp; > quote q1. why was politics bough up nung dinner? i did not want to talk about politics because i knew it was going to be a mess, pero my sister thought our casual arguments sa fb nuon nung tita is civil and casual. she thought wrong. she had no idea the tita was extremely pro-marcos. she tried to change the topic but we decided na umalis bago magka-gulo (because i get really unpleasant pag nasimulan ko nang magalit and isa yun sa puna ng wife ko sakin kaya ayaw ko siya lalo ma-stress) anywho, lesson learned sa kapatid ko lol &nbsp; >quote q2. di bako sumagot or stoop up for what i believe in? i tried. di sa pag-tanggol sa pagkatalo or sa binoto ko, pero sa misinformation na nagbblur sa totoo at hindi. ang sagot sakin ""naniniwala ka kasi sa fake news. dun ka sa totoong balita lang. wag sa kwento kwento sa facebook at tiktok."" can't argue with people who always things they're right. siya nag-banggit na kay leni kami nag-vote last election and my side of the family all nodded (said ""yes. syempre tita."") then she proceeded to complain about the philippines being poor right now and then overcompensating sa pag-puri kay bbm after niya magreklamo. lol also i don't ever want to stoop low para makipag-sampalan at murahan sa harap nung bunso nila (na awkwardly listening to her mom talk about marcos. i guess she's the ""odd"" one in the family.) &nbsp; >quote q3. but they body-shamed your wife? di ka pumatol? as mentioned i can become harsh pag galit ako. my wife doesn't like me when i'm at that point of anger kaya we just looked at each other and signaled na umalis na. although i told them my wife is building strength kasi nag-ddeadlift siya. di nila alam ata kung ano yun. tbh nung tumahimik ako, napansin nung bf ng sister ko and akala daw nila may gagawin ako. i'm honestly surprised i held it in like that. i'm quite proud of myself. charot &nbsp; >quote q4. important ba sila sa inyo? nung bago-bago palang kami sa canada isa yung tita na nagshashare ng food niya samin sa work, nag-lolook out for us and genuinely concerned if we were okay. kaya masakit din na this happened. &nbsp; >quote q5. anong nangyari sa fresh lumpia? binigyan kami ng pa-take home pero wala na gusto kumain. binalik ko yung plate nila kahapon pero di ko na kinausap. iniwan ko nalang sa pinto nila. &nbsp; &nbsp; >quote edit: clarified that not all websites with ""https://"" are legit din.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/y1fwdi/my_thanksgiving_dinner_experience_with_a_bbm/,11 10 2022
Nakakapagod Mabuhay,"hello. last year, my mom was diagnosed with cancer. simula nung mag start yung treatment nawalan kami ng stable income kasi walang trabaho si mama at si papa dahil sya ang laging kasama ni mama sa pagpunta sa hospital. i struggled sa pag aaral halos araw-araw madaling araw na ako natutulog kasi need ko gumawa ng mga problem sets, and plates. fortunately, naka survive ako ng 1st year as a president's lister so i'm really grateful kasi kinaya ko. ngayon update lang kay mama, she was diagnosed with cervical cancer stage 3b and nag start na sya mag treatment pero nahihirapan yung katawan nya mag keep up sa mga gamot kaya sobra yung pinayat nya and yung lab nya ngayon is bagsak kaya need nya magpasalin ng dugo. sobrang hirap nung process sa pagsalin ng dugo kasi yung mga kamag-anak namin tinalikuran kami walang willing tumulong sa amin kaya hirap na hirap kami maghanap ng pera. grabe lang kasi noon kapag may kailangan sila, isang sabi lang nagbibigay agad ng tulong sila mama pero ngayon na kami yung may kailangan ni hindi man lang nila makamusta si mama. one time nga nung nanghingi kami ng dugo gusto nila pabayaran, alam ko naman na wala ng libre ngayon pero kasi kamag-anak mo na yun bakit ayaw mo tulungan. naubos na yung ipon ni mama at papa pambili ng gamot walang wala na kami. ako umaasa ako sa scholarship para mag aral yung kalahati pa nung nakukuha ko sa scholarship pinambabayad namin sa bahay. naiinggit ako sa ibang students na sinusuportahan ng magulang yung tipong walang iisipin kung hindi mag-aral. sobrang napapagod na talaga ako lalo na naririnig ko minsan si papa na nagsasabi na gusto na daw nya mawala kasi napapagod na sya tapos maririnig ko na umiiyak si mama kasi sobrang sakit daw ng katawan nya. yung philhealth hindi kami makakuha kasi hindi naghulog sila mama noon. sobrang nakakapagod. if anyone wants to help kahit piso pandagdag lang pambili sa gamot ni mama, please message me. ayoko po manghingi pero kasi walang wala na kami. hindi ko na alam gagawin ko. pagod na pagod na po ako. update: ngayon lang po ako nakapag online ulit. kauuwi ko lang po galing school. nagpunta po si papa kanina sa emergency para kumuha ng dugo pero ubos na raw po yung dugo kaya maghahanap pa lang po kami sa ibang hospital. bukas rin po pupunta sila mama sa pgh kasi nahihirapan po si mama kumain ng solid foods kaya need nya magpa dextrose. magpapa confine po sila ng mga ilang araw para po medyo maging maayos pakiramdam ni mama para matuloy ang radiation and chemo nya.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/17aejfi/nakakapagod_mabuhay/,18 10 2023
pinagsisinungalingan ko lahat ng taong nakapaligid sakin kasi nahihiya akong aminin na wala na akong pera,"nagresign ako sa first and recent job ko last june. i'm a minimum wager and at the same time, breadwinner ng family ko. 3 pa yung mga kapatid kong nag aaral and yung papa ko is farmer sa probinsya. lahat sila andun, ako lang nandito. biglaan yung pagreresign ko. hindi ko talaga balak magresign. pero sobra na kasing nakakaapekto sa mental health ko yung work environment ko. talagang hindi ko na kaya. kaya biglaan din talaga. although hindi ako nagsisising nagresign ako kahit ganito nangyayari sakin ngayon. so fast forward, dahil nga minimum wager ako at tatlong kapatid ko pa ang pinag aaral ko, super di kasya yunh sweldo ko. kaya nagkaron ako ng utang. yung last payment na nakuha ko is pinambayad ko sa mga utang ko. pero hindi yan ang problem. last april, nagbook ako ng flight pauwi sa probinsya kasi almost 4 years ko nang di nakikita at nakakasama yung family ko. binook ko sya ng august 12 to 22 kasi august ang pinakamarami naming walang pasok dun sa work ko (kasi nga wala talaga sa plan ko ang magresign). 1 month na akong walang work. nagtry nako ng mga side husstles pero wala talaga. wala nakong pera. nung may pera kasi ako, ako gumagastos lahat dito sa bahay. dalawa kami ng kapatid ng papa ko dito sa bahay na tinitirahan ko. unfortunately, wala din syang work matagal na. pero kanya kanya kasi kami before. pero nung bago pa ako nawalan ng work, bumili ako ng mga kaldero lutuan etc kasi nga mawawalan ako work. tapos ayun, dati hindi sya dito nakain. sa iba. pero nung nagluluto luto nako, dito na sya lagi nakain. hanggang sa ako na lahat ang gumagastos. kapag di ako nag asikaso ng pagkain, sa labas or sa iba sya kakain. pero pag may pagkain dito, kakain sya. triny ko narin magluto ng pang akin lang, syempre may natitira pa dun diba, nagugulat ako pagcheck ko, kinain na nya. kaya hanggang sa heto nako now. it's been one week narin since huli akong kumain on time. palaging isang beses lang, or minsan hindi tulad kahapon. kanina kumain ako kasi inaya ako mg friend ko kumain sa kanila. isang beses lang ako kumain. kasi nga wlaa na talaga akong pera. august 12, flight ko na pauwi. maraming nagtatanong sakin about sa pag uwi ko and palagi konh sinasabi na tuloy ako. kasi hindi ko kayang sabihin sa kanila na wala na akonv pera pang uwi. namomroblema talaga ako sobra. nagdadalawang isip ako kunh uuwi pa ako. kung hindi ako uuwi, makakapag apply na ako. pero maghihintay na naman ako ng ilang buwan bago ako makauwi or worst next year na ako makauwi. sayang pati yung ticket ko kasi non refundable yun. nagiguilty ako sa pagsisinungaling ko sa mama ko, sa friends, relatives and even sa bf ko. pero hindi ko kayang aminin na wala na akong pera. lalo sa parents ko, sobrang excited pa naman nila na uuwi ako. hindi ko na alam ang gagawin ko. and hindi ko rin alam paano ako makakasurvive hanggang next week. nagtry nako mangutang kaso wala nga akong work, ayaw ako pautangin hahaha. dito ko nalang nilabas kasi hindi ko kayang sabihin kahit kanino. even my best friend, hindi ko talaga kaya. nanghihinayang ako sa chance na makauwi ako since bayad ko na yung ticket. pero anong gagawin ko? paano na? wala din namang pera sila mama. ang hopeless ng aking life. hahahahaha",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/15i4609/pinagsisinungalingan_ko_lahat_ng_taong/,4 08 2023
Nag jogging ako at namigay ng Leni-Kiko merch sa mga tricyle driver at kwento ko kung ano nangyari,"wala na akong chance maka sama sa h2h dahil sa personal commitments so i dedicated my jogging to campaign effort. i decided my target group would be the tricycle station malapit sa amin, marami kasing nagparinig sa akin doon noong naka leni shirt ako. **good/neutral experience:** nagmeryenda ako ng pansit sa tindahan doon tapos yung dalawang nakasabay na kumain interested kung bakit ako nangangampanya. nagtawag sila ng ibang driver na nahihiyang lumapit para makakuha ng merch (face masks). since highschool kasi ako sumasakay ako sa station nakilala nila ako. mga remarks: - ang sipag mo naman - idol mo talaga si leni - kaninong grupa ka? (kasi i learned may iba nang volunteers na pumunta doon dati) - saan saan ka na nakapunta? (rallies) emphasis on ""idol"" when speaking about leni. they are in a mindset i'm doing this because i idolize a person. tapos curious sila aa merch ko sabi ko binili ko walang bayad ginagawa ko kampanya lang. sabi ko sa pasay lang ako umattend (so it's clear to them i'm not a rally hopper). i also said wala akong partida or grupo, sarili ko lang. i managed to steer the conversation to sumilao farmers. i told them i used to be apathetic/walang pake kung sinong pangulo dati (partly true, i was undecided until march just not bbm), tapos nagbago isip ko kasi sa story ng farmers. **not so good experience** one driver ask my age, if i'm married, and if i have a manliligaw then when he learned i'm single he's like ""sabi na nga"". i don't entirely consider this negative in a sense ganito talaga matatanda that they couldn't comprehend why some women marry late, pero i'm 80% sure they wouldn't ask the same question to a man. tapos yung mga nag ubos ng merch ko, paglayo nila nang-aasar ng ""wala kaming paki sa pangulo mo"" nq parinig saka i can overhear na ""bayad na 300 pesos umattend sa rally ni leni,"" at ""next week pag natalo kakabahan lahat yan."" when i walked near them they were suddenly silent. puro sila parinig pag malayo ako but they couldn't say it to my face. i chose not to engage na since i'm a lone woman saka it's like their baiting me with pang-aasar. **all in all** may iilang nakinig, kahit sexist pakikitungo sa akin, at least narinig nila yung kwento ng sumilao farmers. abonado merch, abonado oras, no regrets. hindi to for leni, para sa prinsipyo.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/uezuju/nag_jogging_ako_at_namigay_ng_lenikiko_merch_sa/,30 04 2022
Dookki Gateway Mall 2 branch - From bad food experience to Gateway Admin Office to Barangay Hall!,"&#x200b; pa rant lang po, d lang talaga fair sa kung paano na handle ng dookki yung situation at kung san pa kami dinala at napunta. specifically gateway mall 2 branch. franchise daw sila, meaning iba iba may ari ng dookki, hindi iisa, so baka dito lang sa branch na to panget yung food and service. d ko nilalahat yung dookki, eto lang talagang branch na to. hays. &#x200b; p.s. pwede ba ako mag post ng honest food review sa fb ng hindi ako hahabulin ng dookii legally? thank you sa mga sasagot! &#x200b; warning: long post :( may short at long version po, pili na lang kayo kung ano pasok sa time nyo huhu. \------------------ short version (yes short na talaga yan eh) \-------------------- \-brought my parents sa recently opened dookki korean buffet. we were 3. \- ""kumain"" ng 5-10 minutes. wala nga kaming naubos na isang buong kahit ano. \-nagreklamo kasi malamig food, wala lasa pagkain, at may mga langaw. \- imbes na mahanapan ng resolution na both parties agreed to, manager and owner(whom he talked to on the phone) decided to call guards and bring us to gateway admin office instead without informing us. nagmuka kaming eat and run. d nga kami lumabas mismo ng buffet. sumama si manager. \- dun sa admin office, after they heard both sides, manager offered a resolution. wala pa daw sagot si owner sa phone, pero 1 person na lang daw bayaran. sagot na lang daw nya yung 2 na tao. then we agreed. \- after going out for a while, returned and retracted his resolution. d daw pumayag owner. ano kaya yun. pwde naman nya d na lang sabihin sa owner na kami yung nagbayad sa part na sasagutin nya kung genuine sya sa sinabi nya before dba. eh ayun d nagkasundo ulit. was escorted next to barangay hall. \- after barangay heard both sides, they fairly judged that to make both parties happy, we should at least pay half. the bill was 550 each, total of 1650 for 3. so mga 800 na lang babayran namin. \- but owner (manager called again) decided to sue us, kasuhan na lang daw kami. mas gusto ni owner magsampa ng kaso na pwede mas malaki pa ilalabas nyang pera sa lawyer, sa papers, etc. , instead of giving any discount. \-barangay knows that this case was too small and too hassle, and nakakahiya na iakyat pa yung ganitong klaseng kaso sa isang gov. agency (3 letters d ko na matandaan) kasi maliit na bagay lang. \-barangay offered to shoulder half of the payment (800), wag na lang daw ituloy yung kaso. kasi yun nga una, nakakahiya daw, pangalawa, hassle rin kasi maliit na bagay pwede pag usapan. \- pumayag kami para lang matapos na. 3-4 hours lumipas , tapos parents ko at ako gutom pa rin. kaya nga dapat d kami pumayag na maglabas ng kahit magkano eh. tsaka magmumuka kaming hindi cooperative kung inayawan pa namin yung half half na settlement. ending: \- owner gets the full amount and wins (ayaw talaga kasi asikasuhin ng barangay kasi nakakahiya at hassle talaga para sa maliit na bagay mag sampa ng kaso sa gantong amount and klase.) \-nawalan 800 pesos kasi d naman kami kumain talaga. \- gutom pa rin kami pagkatapos -\_\_- &#x200b; &#x200b; \------------------------------------ long version \-------------------------------- bagong bukas yung dooki korean buffet dun sa bagong gateway, so nag plan ako dalin parents ko dun para ma experience namin, we haven't tried any other branches yet. pumunta kami ng mga bandang 1-2pm. nung pakuha na ako ng sarili kong food, may langaw sa maki/sushi, pero d ko na lang pinansin binugaw ko na lang. so eto yung mga reklamo ko sa food by order of consumption: &#x200b; sushi/maki \- cold, below room temperature, hindi lang yung hindi mainit, malamig talaga. \- matigas yung kanin parang lumang kanin or parang yung sa bahay lang galing na d maganda pagkakasaing. sabi ko baka makabawi sa chicken... \- malamig rin. mas malapit sa matigas kesa sa malambot. &#x200b; parang nawawalan na ako ng gana. sana masarap naman tong chapchae nila.. \- malamig \- walang lasa, literal walang asin or kahit anong flavor akong matikan, noodles na malamig lang. (mas may lasa pa yung chapchae ng bon chon) &#x200b; tinanong ko parents ko naman kung nag eenjoy ba sila baka ako lang kasi maarte. ayun sabi rin nila hindi masarap food. &#x200b; so mga 10 min lang kami kumain sa table, hindi kasama yung time na paghahanap ng food na mga 10-15 minutes. parang wala na rin kasi mapili masyadong food eh. konti lang compared sa ibang buffet, parang d sya considered na buffet sakin. mali ko lang d muna ako umikot sa food, kasi inassume ko na pag buffet marami talaga pagpipilian. so kesa makahanap pa kami ng ibang food para makabawi dun sa mga malalamig na food, wala na masyado pagpipilian talaga. so ayun, kesa sa pilitin namin na ienjoy yung food kahit d naman talaga, nag decide na ako magreklamo, and sana full refund, kasi parang yung kinain naman mga worth 100 lang, tapos yung food na d nagalaw nasa tancha ko mga 200-300 pesos lang. pero okay na rin ako sakali kung d pumayag, kahit 1 person na lang bayararan namin. ayun eto na mga ganap. &#x200b; sabi ko sa parents ko wag na sila kumain, then called a manager. we expressed our concerns, na saglit pa lang kami kumakain, na malamig pagkain, etc. umalis saglit, d ko alam san nagpunta. tapos bumalik, sabi nya bawi na lang daw sila next time. ano yun? panong bawi eh ano gagastos ulit kami diun eh ayaw na nga namin kumain ulit dun. tapos pagbabayarin pa kami dun sa kinain naming kokonti? ano kaya yun. sabi ko hindi naman pwede ganun lang. ayun umalis ulit. nung bumalik samin, yung leftover daw d na daw ichacharge samin (meaning neto need pa rin namin mag pay ng full amount.) eh magkano lang yung charge na yun 250, tsaka babayaran mo lang talag yun kung may tira eh. eh mismong yung pagkain nga d namin gusto kaya naging tira. ayun umalis ulit. kung iisipin, pwede naman ding ang ginawa nya is mag sorry at mag offer ng new food na mainit, pero hindi eh. eto sana pwede nyang sinuggest samin nung una pa lang, kaso mainit na ulo ko nung time na yun kasi d maayos pagkakahandle nung manager, tsaka late ko na naisip, nung nasa barangay hall na kami. oops lumaktaw na ako haha, balik ako sa kwento. bumalik samin, nag spill ng script si manager! halata na medyo kinakabahan, tapos scripted yung sinasabi nya. na parang wala silang magagawa ganun chu chu pero sa english syempre. eh alam naman nila na kakapasok lang rin namin. bakit d magawan ng paraan to? ayun biglang umalis sa kalagitnaan ng script nya, baka may tumawag sa kanya sa labas. so ayun, napansin na namin kaya pala sya umaalis is para tawagan yung boss nya, which is yung mismong owner nung franchise. i learned na franchise lang sila, at hindi iisang big food company, which means hindi iisa may ari, iba iba per franchise. i learned this nung nasa barangay hall na lang rin. &#x200b; nagantay kami ng mga 20-30 min, pero wala pa ring sagot pa daw si owner. we suggested to pay at least for 1 person for 550 kahit sa totoo lang hindi aabot ng 200 pesos yung dinala naming food sa table. ang tagal kasi gawan ng paraan naiininip na kami, d naman namin pwede galawin yung pagkain kasi nga syempre nagrereklamo kami sa food. nakatunganga na lang kami bale. ang tagal talaga eh. so ayun sasabihin daw nya sa owner kung pwedeng 1 person na lang bayaran. &#x200b; may napansin mom ko sa buffet, ang daming langaw. sabi ko sa kanya picturan nya in case, kung ayaw nilang pumayag magparefund, pakita na lang natin na may mga langaw food nila. which is totoo naman. kaso nung kukuha na ng picture mom ko, nagsialisan, kaya wala tuloy kaming kuha. ang kuha ko lang is may video ng 1-2 langaw, pero nasa table lang, d ko lang alam kung pwede magamit sa kanila yun in any case, kung counted pa rin ganun. &#x200b; so nag antay ulit kami. maya maya, napapansin ko na may mga guard na sa labas ng dookki. weird lang kasi medyo marami, mga 3-5? tapos d lang sa iisang lugar, parang nakakalat sila sa labas. d ko na lang muna pinansin. pero maya maya pinuntahan nakami tapos dinala kami sa mga guard, tsaka lang nya sinabi na sa admin office ng gateway na lang daw namin i settle yung problema. eh para samin, bakit pa idadamay mismong gateway kung kaya naman pag usapan to within the 2 parties? ang lala naman ng ganun, nagmuka tuloy kaming eat and run. d bale kung naka eat nga eh. tsaka kung nag run, mismong d nga kami lumabas ng buffet. sino ba d maiinis? yung pwede pag usapan, pinalala pa at dinamay yung gateway? d ko magets ano nangyayare. ayun, dinala na kami sa admin office, kasama yung manager. &#x200b; pagdating dun sa office, nag explain kami ng sides dun sa admin. may iba ring tao, mga security ata mga 3-4 sila. sinabi lang rin namin ulit yung reklamo dun sa food ng buffet, at wala kami masyado nakain, etc. sinabi namin dinala na lang kami dito ng d namin alam, na ayun nga d pa nga namin alam feedback ni owner dun sa offer naming payment na 1 na tao. sino ba d maiinis sa ganung outcome eh. maya maya, pagkatapos mag explain both sides, si manager wala pa ring sariling desisyon, labas ulit ng office para tawagan si owner. &#x200b; after a while, bumalik sya, sabi nya wala pa raw reply, pero sasagutin na lang daw nya yung 2 persons para lang matapos yung issue. &#x200b; edi ayun ""dapat"" tapos na yung issue, nagsalita na kasi sya eh. pumayag na kami, 550 yung babayaran. wala akong barya, binigay ko 1k. balik na lang daw sya sa dookki para suklian at bigyan kami ng resibo. narinig lahat ng tao dun sa kwarto pati admin at security sa usapan. &#x200b; ayan happy mood na ulit ako kasi tapos na yung problema eh. nakipag kwentuhan na rin kina admin, etc. mabait rin sila kahit mukang nakakatakot, kasi security iba dun eh, nakakaintimidate lang, share lang. so lumipas 20 minutes, ayan nakabalik na rin sya sa wakas. kaso nung pagpasok, parang 1k pa rin hawak nya. ayan na nga. sabi samin, d daw pumayag si owner na sya magbayad, dapat daw kami... kung nasa kanya naman daw, walang problema sagutin nya yung 2 na tao. &#x200b; ahm... eh kung d na lang nya sinabi sa owner na sya yung magbabayad at sinabing kami yung nagbayad para tapos na? parang d naman naging valid at genuine yung pagiging makatao nya sa rason nya. kung nasa kanya? eh kung nasa kanya naman pala, eh di di na lang nya sana sinabi na sya magbabayad, para matapos na. so ano? ang hipokrito naman nun. lumalabas na insincere syang tao. gusto nya lang lumabas na genuine sya, pero d naman siguro halata na nagbago lang isip nya? may nakausap siguro pagbalik nya sa dookki, kaya nagbago isip. &#x200b; eto, d na ulit nagkasundo, sabi ni admin, dalin na daw eto sa barangay. ayun na nga. daming eme. &#x200b; sabi namin sige, ganun lang rin naman mangyayari ulit, kung ano nangyare ngayon. &#x200b; ganun pa rin ganap, pagdating sa barangay hall ng cubao, nag explain both sides. pero ang pinagkaiba lang sa side nila, meron silang picture na nung pagkain namin, na before wala. pinapamuka nila na kung d naman daw kami nag enjoy bakit andaming food sa table. eh malamang kinuha yun nung una pa lang. d naman ibig sabihin nun nag enjoy na agad. tapos kwento 30-40 minutes daw kami nandun, kasi may timer daw yung induction stove nila dun sa ginamit namin dun sa soup. nag- iba na panig nila, pinapalabas na nila na kumain kami tapos gusto naming tumakbo. hay kaloka. &#x200b; nakakapagod mag kwento ang haba, pero patapos na. &#x200b; paigsiin ko na kasi paulit ulit na yung iba dun sa sinabi namin sa admin office. so ayun, nag intervene ang barangay. para walang away daw, kalahti na lang bayaran namin. pero sinabi namin sa barangay , kahit anong discount ayaw naman bigay ng dookki. tinanong nila ulit si manager para matapos na, ayun. labas ulit. call owner. bumalik. ayaw pa rin daw ng owner. magsasampa na lang daw sila ng kaso... &#x200b; sabi namin sige lang, magsampa kayo ng kaso. alam kasi ni dad na mas mahal pa magagastos nila sa lawyer at sa iba pa, para lang asikasuhin yung kaso para sa 1650, kaya d rin kami natatakot, tsaka sincere naman talaga kami sa reklamo namin, d naman kami eat and run. ayun, medyo nasisiraan na rin ng ulo mga barangay sa side ng dookkii, kasi d man lang mag adjust kahit konti. &#x200b; pero kung gusto daw talaga nila magsampa ng kaso, need daw nila ng spa. si manager daw mag aasikaso nun. by that time, medyo halata na napapagod na si manager, kasi d sya makakilos, wala syang sariling desisyon, tapos d nya na alam gagawin pagdating sa mga legal stuff. eh wala eh sabi sa kanya ng owner nya na magsampa, so wala syang choice talaga. &#x200b; pero sa totoo lang, ayaw rin ipatuloy ng barangay yung kaso, kasi nakakahiya daw i escalate pa daw to dun sa gov ageny na nabanggit, 3 letters yun d ko na maalala sorry d talaga familiar sakin, parang ngayon ko lang narinig. nakakahiya daw kasi maliit na bagay lang tsaka maliit na halaga, na kaya naman daw pag usapan, pero pinaabot pa sa kaso. tingin ko rin medyo may hassle rin sa side nila, d ko lang alam ano mga gagawin nila talaga. masasabihan rin siguro sila na simpleng issue d nila maayos, kaya ayun ayaw nila magkaron ng record. &#x200b; so kesa daw ituloy yung kaso, sabi ng barangay, sagot na daw nila yung kalahati. bayaran na lang daw namin yung 800. &#x200b; para sakin lang, d dapat kami pumayag kasi sa dulo kami panalo eh, kasi mangyayare d rin matutuloy kaso kasi una, oras na magagamit nila, pangalwa, yung gastos nilan sa lawyer, etc. . para magdemanda ng 1650 pesos. &#x200b; pero ayun pumayag na lang rin kami sa half. para tapos na. pumayag kami kasi: \- magaling magsalita yung barangay, persuasive, people person, kaya mapapaoo ka na talaga \- pag kumontra pa kami dun, lalabas lang rin na ayaw rin namin makipag cooperate \- ayoko na rin ma stress parents ko. &#x200b; so ano nangyare sa huli \- nakuha nila full amount, 800 samin, 800 galing barangay \- gumastos ng 800 para sa food worth 100-200 \- at pinaka nakakainis sa lahat, gutom. pa rin. kami. &#x200b; so kumain na lang kami sa iba. so gastos is 800 + 500 = 1300 para sa simpleng pagkain lang. &#x200b; ayun salamat sa pakikinig. nakakainis lang talaga eh. pera is pera. may right naman tayo umayaw sa food kung d naman talaga masarap, at alam mo sa sarili mo na d ka umabuso. &#x200b; &#x200b; &#x200b; &#x200b; &#x200b; &#x200b; &#x200b; &#x200b; &#x200b; &#x200b;",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/17iomjd/dookki_gateway_mall_2_branch_from_bad_food/,28 10 2023
I wish PH has a system wherein people clean up after themselves sa restaurants.,"this always bugs me, i'm pretty sure makakarelate ang iba. alam niyo yung mahaba na pila sa counter, tapos wala pang maupuan? ang kung mayroon man, ang kalat kalat nung table, minsan yung leftovers nasa sahig na, nasa upuan pa. personally, i always clean up after myself, and use excess tissues to wipe the table pa nga. sa fastfood chains, i gather all the dishes and ilagay sa tray, para mapadali na rin kuhain ng bust boys yung mga pinagkainan. kahit ilang beses ako kumain sa labas, super kadiri lang talaga minsan. sa mang inasal and tropical hut na napuntahan ko na, *andaming chicken bones sa sahig*. really makes me wonder kung ano ang eating habits ng mga taong to, or sadyang walang pakialam ang mga pinoy kasi alam nilang may maglilinis ng kinakalat nila? plus the people that wash their hands sa plato mismo, tas ilulublob pa yung tissue doon after mapunas, sobrang .... hindi ko alam. random rant na siguro. maski kasi kahit saan, lagyan mo ng basurahan malapit sa table, iiwan pa rin kalat nila diyan sa lamesa. sanay na may tagaligpit ng kalat nila? do you think ba na may chance mabago to, or wala. i know workers get paid for their job, pero it would save them and us customers time naman kung mas maayos palagi ang kainan agad, kukuhain nalang ang tray or may area to put your trays back ano.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/vtldyz/i_wish_ph_has_a_system_wherein_people_clean_up/,7 07 2022

"Somebody asked me, ""Paano maging mabait?""","and eto yung reply ko sa kanya. i would also like to have some insights from all of you. \------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ empathy is the key acquired skill yung empathy and pwede siyang practisin (detail shiz na this) and some innately have it. kung malalagay mo yung sarili mo sa situation ng ibang tao that's good enough but mas better kung empathy + iisipin mo kung pano gagaaan yung situation nila moving forward. it doesn't have to be complicated, pwedeng magstart in small things. like sa food court, nakaugalian ko na na ayusin yung mga natira ko/naming pagkain sa table, like pinupunasan ko pa yung mesa with tissue. kukunin na lang ng mga cleaners yung tray na organized na. sinasabihan pa ako ni mommy na iwanan mo na yan may magliligpit nyan, hindi ako nakikinig. eh ano ba naman yung ayusin na yung basura kasi kami naman kumain nun, i remember na yung pinagkainan namin sa foodcourt ako pa nagabot kay kuya na cleaners nung tray kasi medyo malayo yung pwesto niya. paalis na kami nun, tinapon ko na sa basurahan yung box, yung tray na lang inabot ko sa kanya, and ako pa nagthank you. it's a matter of simple things na hindi man makakaimpact sa kanila pero at least gumaan yung trabaho nila kahit for a second. and that can apply to all aspects of life. from career to relationships, if you're natural giver, mas madali siyang gawin. and it's not that you will be a yes man, unhealthy yun, dapat balance lang. walang macocompromise na situation it should be win win for both shoes. mutual help dapat. walang givers, walang takers. yun yung ideal world if lahat ng tao natural empaths. pero since we are just people na sobrang daming flaws, we can just only do so much para sa iba nang hindi mo nalulubog sa baha yung sarili mong sapatos. most of the time, hanggang dun mo lang sila kayang tulungan and that's enough. kumbaga you've done your part. sila na bahala sa the rest. and it doesn't mean na wala ka nang pakialam sa kanila after all. kelangan lang din nilang tulungan yung sarili nila for better. kung may empathy sila kahit papano, maiisip nila na baka hassle na sa kabilang party yung favors and help and it's time to give back the favor, not only for you but for others.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ispjff/somebody_asked_me_paano_maging_mabait/,14 09 2020

Question: PUV Vehicle rules (not wearing of face mask daw),"hinuli ako ng highway patrol guard for not wearing facemask yung passenger ko at improper wearing of seatbelt daw. what really happen: pagkakapasok namin ng express, ibinaba ni passenger yung nakasukbit sa balikat niya na seat belt para kuhain yung pagkain sa likod at tinanggal lang niya kabilang side ng tenga ng mask para kumain pero di totally hinubad. biglang harang samin ng hway patrol guard at violation noong una is improper wearing of belt at not wearing of face mask based daw sa camera nila. eh hindi naman talaga nakahubad totally yung mask that time para sabihin niyang not wearing. nabasa ko naman regarding sa mga puv vehicles rules wear your mask at all times. pero parang unfair ng ginawa sa part kong yun na ang violation is not wearing facemask. tanggapin ko naman kung wala talagang suot pero hindi eh. dapat daw pagkasubo, suotin uli daw yung mask. ngayon dito ako sa laguna at qc ko pa kkuhain yung lisensya. marereklamo ko ba yung mga ganitong situation kasi napakaunfair lang ng nangyari. salamat sa sasagot. ganito ba kawalang ka consideration mga officer natin? note: taga laguna ako and sa calax ako nahuli then inissue-an akong top at qc main ko pa makukuha daw yung lisensya ko. may chance ba kong icontest tong pangyayari kasi hindi naman talaga nakahubad yung face mask ng passenger ko. walang cam kotse ko. pero nakakairits lang na paransabihin na not wearing face mask na yung ginawa. salamat sa sasagot.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/hbccr1/question_puv_vehicle_rules_not_wearing_of_face/,18 06 2020
How did growing up in a toxic Pinoy family F you up as a person?,"warning: ed, verbal abuse, child abuse my grandparents are just as toxic as my parents. my mom and dad are a couple of spineless cowards. takot rin sila sa lolo't lola ko, kaya hindi nila kami ipinagtatanggol pag ""dinidisiplina"" kami. i am the first of three siblings and the only female. our family lived in our ancestral home because my mother was my lolo and lola's favorite daughter. growing up in the 90s, my lolo and lola always found food and mealtime as the best means to punish me with. at around four years old to 8, talagang may kahinaan ako kumain. my lolo would always be the one to serve me food. sa akin niya lang ito ginagawa. every time ang dami niyang ilalagay sa plato ko na combination of kanin mixed with whatever viand we're having na halos an inch a way na lang from the edge of the plate sa sobrang dami. as in, itsura pa lang, nalulunod na ako. he would sit across me from the dining table and watch me like a hawk during meal time. he would remind me ever so often to take a bite. ""putang ina. wag mo tungangaan yan. sumubo ka!"", ""wag mo susuhin 'yang pagkain mo! lulunin mo yan!"", ""ano? kakain ka, o isusubsob kita sa pagkain mo na parang aso?"" some nights, nagwawala siya pag di ako makalampas sa tatlong subo. may isang beses na pinagbabasag niya yung plato ko't baso habang nagsisisigaw. tumigil rin kumain yung buong pamilya kasi nalagyan ng mga bubog yung pagkain namin. i remember crying myself to sleep that night nang hindi na nakapaligo pa sa sobrang takot. whenever i cannot finish my meal which is almost every meal, every day, paparusahan ako. the parusa can range from having rights, privileges and my favorite things taken from me. from no tv especially on weekends, my fave books get taken away as well as my toys bawal ko rin hawakan at kalaruin yung aso namin kung di, papaluin ng lolo ko yung aso para pati daw yung alaga ko ""magtanda"". (anong kinalaman nung aso sa di ko pagkain? bakit siya dapat magtanda!?) sometimes my fave toy at the moment gets placed in the middle of the dining table and i only get to touch it if i finish my meal. since hindi ko nga kaya , i usually just bid these toys goodbye. (yung isa kong polly pocket, nakuha ko na at 12 ish years old. na-outgrow ko na siya.) so, to remedy this i worked on being able to eat. then, i gained weight around my pre-teens given the amount of rice i was supposed to finish daily, my lola started taking over out of the blue. all she did was bully me whenever we're eating. especially pag may ibang tao like if we have guests or we're eating out. she would yell things at me. stuff like :""non-stop talaga yang bunganga mong putang ina ka noh? kaya ka lumolobo eh."" one time my uncle winced and called her out when he heard her say ""anlaki-laki ng ng tiyan mo, panay saksak mo pa rin ng pagkain sa muka mong tang ina ka."" when we were out sa grocery, she woud shame me sa mga sales people and sa cashier telling them na. ""lahat 'yan para dito lang sa elepante ko."" or when i would pick an item for myself she would scream out loud for other shoppers to hear na: ""sige! lamon! ang galing galing mo talaga pag dating sa pagpili ng lalamunin mo!"" and she would do this angrily. hindi passive agressive. as in galit at pasigaw. kaya super nakakahiya. when she's in a subtle mood. she would mockingly immitate the way i chew and would laugh calling me: "" babuy!"" or would sarcastically comment on my appearance pag halimbawa naka-ayos ako ""ganda mo, para kang palanggana."" she would also deny me of food at times. say for example she buys a box of donuts, ako lang ang di pwede kumuha. and at times, would accuse me of stealing food or treats at home only to find out na ang kumuha ay either of my brothers. my brothers would deliberately shield me and even so. sasabihin niya na tinakot ko daw yu g mga kapatid ko kaya pinagtatakpan ako. because of this, my brothers learned na magpaalam even for just a handful of m&ms para wag nila ako makitang pinagtitripan ng lola ko. and because i was just so over this treatment, nag diet naman ako. hindi ko namalayan na sumosobra na pala. it didn't help na in the 2000s the pro-ana-mia movement was in full swing. and the media was advocating for thinnes overall. the fashions at the time also favored slim frames. sick as it may seem, i found refuge in bingeing and purging. nakakain ko lahat ng gusto ko without having to gain weight. i also felt that i looked great in the latest trends at that time. i got hospitalized in 2007 for contracting a fatal gastrointentional infection which almost took me out because i was too weak to fight it. violent stomach upsets ba naman at vomitting and diarrhea ang primary symptoms. i weighed only 85lbs at 5ft. 3"". if it weren't for this infection, i wouldn't have been diagnosed with bulimia. it took a nutritionist, our family gastroenteroligist and my first psychiatrist and a couple of female professors na parang mommy figure ko sa school to help get me back to a healthy 115 lbs. i tried to work hard with them to get my life back. pero sa bahay, everything i went through was treated as nothing more than a physiological issue. walang may gusto mag address nung trauma which caused it all. they say, that's my psych's job. yung mommy ko naman, sinasabi niya na hindi niya maalala yung mga kinuwento ko sa inyo dito kanina. but she was always there when this happened. my brothers remember it too! mas naiiyak ako rito pag naiisip ko keysa sa mga pinagsasasabi sa akin ng lolo at lola ko. like, how can mom not remember? yun ba ang trauma response niya? selective amnesia? dahil ba hindi niya kakayanin kung di lilimutin ng utak niya as a form of defense? idk, pero parang mas nasasaktan ako doon. i feel so betrayed. in my 20's i got myself a career one na super minahal ko, pero sucked the soul out of me kasi very competitive and demanding. that time, i got back into bingeing and stopped seeing my psychiatrist and nutritionist all together. kasi, ako na ang magbabayad sa kanila eh. that time though, hindi na ako nagpupurge. i buried myself in work and sweets. before i know it i was gaining weight again. each time i get stressed, i will take my anger and frustration out on a whole cake, a tub of ice cream or makikipag inuman ako pero ang chaser ko 1.5 na coke at sa akin lang yun. donuts held a special place in my heart. kada may magbubukas na bagong donut shop, you can expect to see me falling in line to get a box! i also had candy in my pockets too. all. the. time! expensive candy or cheap candy is just the same to me. basta candy. i remember my psych said that my obsession with it had something to do with candy being the instrument my lola used as a ""trap"" nung bata ako. now, i am just all too happy na i wouldn't get in trouble for being able to access it as an adult. it didn't come as a surprise sa akin na lumobo ako, this time 3x from when i first gained weight as a preteen. i am full-on obese. where was my lolo and lola? nasa bahay pa rin. so, what i did to avoid them was that i left for work early and leave very late at night. i would even just chill with my boyfriend on weekends wag lang ako matambay sa bahay. from then on, i just lived every day as an obese woman. lahat ng milestones ko in life, i achieved as a fat woman. hindi sa proud ako. that's just what i am. severely depressed and fat -- but somehow unstoppable ma-achieve ang work goals ko. then, i had a very bad, unexpected mental breakdown in 2013. kaya i decided to see a new psychiatrist. i was then diagnosed with ptsd and my chronic depression was due to a hormonal imbalance pala. i got treated for the depression and ptsd. pero hirap ako maging physiologically healthy through food. no matter how much media i consume about living and eating healthy i can't seem to get it right. in 2017, i had a major fight with my lolo and finally ibinulalas ko na lahat ng hinanakit ko. pinagmumumura ko siya, at sinabihan rin ng masasakit na salita. i almost physically assaulted him, pero napigilan ako ng kapatid ko. he knew na siguradong mapapahamak ako if i were to lay a hand on my dirtbag of a lolo. jut imagine my obese ass hitting an 80 year old man. i knew that was the end of my stay at that house. lumayas ako nang walang pagdadalawang-isip and lived with my boyfriend just a month before our wedding. my brother helped me pack at siya ang naghatid sa akin. i never returned home. (my brothers were also theorizing na my lolo deliberately planned on riling me up para mag clash kami because i was about to have a big life event and he just felt like pissing on it. just like how all of a sudden, bigla siyang nagwala bago yung debut ko dati. one of my brothers also thought that kaya sa akin pinaka galit yung grandparents namin ay dahil daw, naging kaagaw nila ako sa attention ng mommy ko / anak nila mula nang ipanganak ako. yun ang sabi nila. ako? ewan ko! talagang hindi ko na lang siya kaya pagtimpian. all i feel is rage and contempt.) i saw my lolo again during my lola's funeral. she died 5 months after ko maglayas. namatay siya nang di kami nag uusap at galit ako sa kanya. when i heard the news i was the only one who had a hard time weeping for her. ff to now? i am living life in my mid 30s with maintenance meds for hypertension, borderline diabetis and chronic depression. but, there is a silver lining. i married a kind, understanding and gentle husband na hindi ako nagsasawang paalalahanan na walang parusa na naka abang sa akin pag hindi ko naubos ang pagkain ko. at, hindi ko na kailangan kainin ang feelings ko, dahil nandito siya para pakinggan ako nang walang paghuhusga. i have had so many doctors try to help me, but i believe that it is only he who is actually healing my inner child little by litte.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/10ijk65/how_did_growing_up_in_a_toxic_pinoy_family_f_you/,22 01 2023
Pagtatakpan mo ba kaibigan mo para maitago ang kabit nya?,"so this happened yesterday. i was hanging out at a friend's house with his fiance. incidentally my friend's kuya has his business office beside my friend's unit. yung kuya nya and his kabit were currently hanging out in the business office. then unannounced, dumating yung asawa nung kuya, bitbit yung 10 year old son. yung mga tauhan ng older brother, nataranta and they immediately informed the kuya na parating yung asawa at anak, kaya nai-lock kaagad yung pinto ng office and the kuya pretended na wala sya sa office. hindi makatakas yung kabit kasi magkakasalubong sila nung asawa at anak. the kuya then called my friend's phone to ask for help, basically to entertain the asawa while staying outside the office, habang trapped inside yung kuya nya sa office with his kabit na hindi makatakas habang nasa labas lang yung asawa at anak. ang plano, invite ng friend ko yung asawa ng kuya nya sa loob ng unit ng friend ko... basically para hindi makita at makatakas yung kabit. lmao. so ayun lumabas kami ng friend ko sa unit and my friend made casual convo with kuya's asawa, inviting her to stay in my friend's unit since kuya's office is 'locked.' kaso hindi nag work yung plano, sabi nung asawa, dun na lang daw sila mag stay sa labas ng office, din na lang maghintay sa pagdating ng asawa. medyo na tense ako sa sitwasyon kasi ayoko may mangyaring eskandalo habang andun yung 10 year old to witness a possible catfight between kabit and his mom. a few minutes later, dumating yung nanay ng kuya at friend ko... may bitbit na pagkain na bibigay sana sa kuya. hinanap ng nanay sa mga tauhan ni kuya, sabi ng mga tauhan di pa dumadating si kuya. so ayun chika chikahan yung nanay at asawa ng kuya ng friend ko. lalo ako kinabahan. iniisip ko kung ka-kuntsaba yung nanay sa pagtatago sa kabit or kung wala din syang alam. pero biglang nag invite yung nanay na pumunta sila sa jollibee para kumain muna, libre daw nya, habang wala si kuya ng friend ko. so dun ko na realize na ka-kuntsaba sya para mapaalis yung asawa sa office para makatakas yung kabit. lmao. so ayun, umalis yung nanay kasama yung asawa at anak ng kuya ng friend ko papuntang jollibee. sinigurado muna nila na nakaalis na yung nanay/ asawa/ anak ng dali dali bumukas yung pinto ng office at nagmamadaling umalis yung kabit... nagpaalam yung kabit sa friend ko and my friend's fiance... hindi na nakatingin si kabit sa akin, siguro nahiya din na baka jina-judge ko sya. lol. sabi ko sa friend ko... grabe, kinabahan ako dun... akala ko may mag aaway na at magkakahulihan... but in the end, the pagtatago mission was a success, kasi everyone helped cover up the kabit... yung mga tauhan ng kuya, yung friend ko and his fiance, yung nanay ng kuya at friend ko was also in on it. napaisip ako bakit complicit yung nanay at yung friend ko sa kalokohan ng kuya nya. yung kuya nya is a successful businessman. most of the income ng nanay galing sa business ng kuya. pati yung friend ko, some of his income comes from his kuya's businesses. matic yung mga tauhan ng kuya ng friend ko syempre loyalty sa nagpapa sweldo sa kanila. i wonder how common this scenario is in filipino culture... kung saan pinagtatakpan yung kabit para lang walang away/ gulo. care to share your stories and insights?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/t03gxy/pagtatakpan_mo_ba_kaibigan_mo_para_maitago_ang/,24 02 2022

Please read the post below.,"it pains my chest, mahirap po manghingi sa mga hindi ko kakilala pero andito po ako sa /r/philippines nanghihingi ng tulong. never ko pa pong ginawa to, at sana po matulungan niyo ang aso ko. &#x200b; my dog's name is nala. f and maltichon. nakuha ko po siya from cavite last august 17, 2 days after my birthday. pinanganak siya ng june 27 2019. me and my girlfriend shared the load mula sa pagbili sa kanya hanggang sa lahat ng gastos, foods and mga vitamins niya, pati mga toys na nasira niya at nginatngat. eto po siya nung puppy to medyo adult niya: [puppy nala](https://preview.redd.it/mw70oqmfltz41.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5abe30fcc57b8cc6a123f3bc9ea6bac75693b78a) &#x200b;

dumating ang ecq at nagsaraduhan na ang mga clinic around last week of march at wala na akong mapuntahang clinic. sarado na din ung lagi naming pinagcoconsultahan. so nakahanap kami ibang clinic dun ko siya dinala, nilakad namin for 30 mins dalawa ni nala para ma skin scrape siya, negative ulit ang findings.. tinuklap hotspot niya at inapplyan ng cream. binigyan kame gamot na nag cost around 2k+ pero sabi ko ok lang para naman to kay nala. 1 week after, walang nangyari, lumala pa. &#x200b;

sincerely from me.* so i'm posting this update para sa mga redditors na nag follow kay nala especially sa mga nag donate. **may 22:** around 2 days after i posted a cry for help sa r/philippines nala isn't getting any better, kumakain pa din may gana pero hindi na ganun kalakas kagaya dati. but thursday night hindi siya kumain which is hindi naman nakakabahala, unfortunately morning to tanghali ayaw niya pa rin kumain so i tried carrying her and kinakausap ko siya but she's not responding. nabahala ako so tinry ko siya itayo para maglakad lakad pero bumabagsak lang siya ulit, nagpanic na ako so i called his original vet if he could help. i know it's a reach kasi ecq pa pero makakapunta daw siya hintayin ko daw siya sa bahay. when he arrived he told me to rush nala sa clinic nila (his original vet clinic) so nalaman ko nagbukas na pala sila around 2nd week of may. sinugod namin si nala sa furry friends sa caloocan and luckily siya lang ang patient non. they told me na grabe na yung damage sa skin niya and saw na baka may maggots yung paws na niya. they also told me that amputation is possible kapag unrepairable na or nabubulok na sugat niya especially sa paws at sa tail. masyado dinb daw manipis balat ni nala and napakadaming flakes na nagfafall off from her body kaya siya nangangati. &#x200b; [at furry friends clinic](https://preview.redd.it/saqrwsbx70251.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9443944503ec0cdd2041bd25de98691f5de3085b) i decided to skin scrape and cbc her. never pa siya na cbc, so ayun ang goal ko kasi hindi ko alam bakit hindi pa siya gumagaling since march. sa skin scrape nakita na meron siyang demodex (hindi ko po alam spelling) pero its an insect that causes itchyness and galis. she's positive for mange. the problem is usually marami na daw yung 1 to 2 na insect sa isang skin scrape pero sa kanya 12 (take note na hindi pa yun sa sugat kumuha) which indicates na sobrang abnormal na ng dami nung parasites. &#x200b; [shivers and cleaning ng sugat niya](https://preview.redd.it/eewwtclz70251.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=47d84285281125ed50cf12986e72905fba1b77b2) they told me this is caused by stress. dapat daw na cocontrol ng immune system niya yung pagdami nun kaso dahil na stress siya most probably because of the grooming kasi dun nagsimula siya mangati, sobrang dumami yung demodex. they even showed me what's on the microscope. nakakalungkot isipin na dahil lang sa simpleng grooming nagkaganyan na yung dating healthy na siya. cbc came out and they saw an abnormality sa mga components. may bacterial infection siya kaya bumababa ata ang hemoglobin niya hindi ko gaanong sure. while we were discussing, nala started to shiver and the doctor said na kinokombulsyon siya kasi 40 degrees yung temperature niya. &#x200b; [sorry nabura na yung cbc na naka attach, i also lost the computation how much it costs but naka php 3200 ako, she has around 6 na iniintake and a spray, plus the three injections.](https://preview.redd.it/z82q4n1380251.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9adfcdb1977fff2d30706a925e9023975745cb67) &#x200b; https://preview.redd.it/50ji08fa80251.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bea67e1d3f2a8d1a55a0fcf680fe2d1c326b73b0 they cleaned her sugat. and injected her three times. yung dalawa anti mange/anti parasite and yung isa for her fever. they told me na this will be a 6 week long na gamutan and babalik kami dun every friday starting 22. i agreed. they also told me to stop seeking for convenia because it'll be too costly and hindi sure na gagana, at least eto daw proven, they told me to make nala sa comfortable as possible to reduce her stress. bumalik na kami last friday and the doctors said na shes getting better albeit she lost .4 kg. pinalitan na din namin diet niya to reflex pero hindi niya gaanong kinakain. she's still weak, barely walking but nakakalakad na at least. the first 3 days din from 22 kamot siya ng kamot as in walang tigil kaya nakaka stress pero since monday she stopped itching na. nagtatanggalan na langib niya din. &#x200b; [her favorite spot on my chair](https://preview.redd.it/evaj95l190251.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=575df5eb0c79a5f0e8595cdfc248329bbbb63014) &#x200b; &#x200b; [latest pic, hindi na reddish skin niya and nagtatanggalan na scabs niya.](https://preview.redd.it/lpfmo7t390251.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4cbf0b6cdff492d9a6045c04268ec1345d1f9533) i**'m here to post this update to thank you guys for the support.** masakit man, pero kelangan ko kayo because some of my family members think na sayang lang ang pera sa kanya at ipamigay na lang daw namin tapos bumili na lang kami ng aso. i had arguments with my family because of this. maraming salamat po, she's recovering slowly pero hindi namin siya titigilan hanggang sa hindi siya gumagaling!

&nbsp; paglilinaw: ang hindrance sa ating progress na humihila sa'tin pababa ay hindi ang criticism o pagpuna sa'ting government officials, kundi ang ating intolerance at galit sa criticism. maganda ang sinabi sa [article na ito](https://www.manilatimes.net/2020/03/19/opinion/columnists/topanalysis/criticizing-as-a-form-of-civic-duty/704176). habang hindi naman tayo gumagawa ng threats o nagdudulot ng harm sa'ting kapuwa, walang masama sa pag-express ng frustrations o konting humor sa mga mali sa ating lipunan at gobyerno. mas ok pa rin yung aware tayo kesa magpikit mata tayo na parang mas mahal na natin ang isang public servant kaysa sa bayan. balansihin din natin. hindi ito pagrebelde o pakikipaglaban sa gobyerno, kundi pag-call out ng inefficiencies at incompetence, at pagsuporta na rin sa checks and balances ng ating lipunan para hindi maabuso ang kapangyarihan. at hindi komo nagrereklamo, hindi ibig sabihin wala tayong ibang ginagawa. si leni nga andaming reklamo ng lugaw na yan, pero halos araw-araw ring nagtrabaho simula day 1. ang gusto lang namin kay leni, kahit kailan hindi siya pagalit mag-voice out ng criticism at malumanay siyang nagbibigay ng suggestions for improvement. kaya marami rin ang akala ay mahina at walang political will si leni kasi malumanay siya. pero hindi siya mahina kundi matapang. isipin mo, presidente na mismo ang pinupuna niya, kahit alam niya ang negative effect sa image at popularity niya dahil alam naman niya ang kultura nating mga pinoy na napaka-allergic sa criticism. kita naman natin ang backlash sa facebook posts niya na flooded ng laugh reacts at toxic comments. pero bakit ba talaga si leni nagvo-voice out? ramdam niya ang mga hinanakit ng taong bayan kasi andun siya mismo parati sa ground at may kamalayan siya sa kalagayan ng mga tao. like yung pag-una pa sa dolomite sand, sabi niya ito raw ay [insensitive](https://mb.com.ph/2020/09/08/manila-bay-white-beach-an-insensitive-plan-in-time-of-pandemic-solon/) kasi magbuhos sana dapat muna ng lahat ng resources at attention sa pandemic, which is a valid point 'di ba? dahil alam niyang kapag mas mabilis maka-return to normal ang labor force natin, mas mabilis aangat muli ang ekonomiya natin. &nbsp; ##2. puppet si leni ng oligarchs! &nbsp; paglilinaw: unlike sa panahon ni cory na may injustices laban sa mga magsasaka, kahit bago pa si leni tumakbo for any public office, no political plans or agenda, bilang lawyer ay mahusay niyang ipinagtanggol na pro bono (walang bayad) ang maraming marginalized sectors. halimbawa ay ang paglaban niya para sa mga lupa ng sumilao farmers against sa conglomerate by the name of san miguel corporation. naipanalo nila ang kaso laban sa mga elite. kaya hindi nakakapagtaka kung bakit todo ang suporta sa kaniya ng mga [sumilao farmers](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/779322/sumilao-farmers-to-march-not-for-land-but-for-robredo). iba iba rin ang ugali ng individual na members ng mga partido, hindi lahat masama o lahat mabuti. halimbawa, sina cory at duterte ay parehas na kabilang sa pdp-laban, na sinimulan naman ni ninoy. kakapalit lang din ni sara recently. makikita rin natin sa saln ni leni na hindi siya kasing yaman ng most politicians, kaya noong sinampahan siya ng kaso ni bbm, may volunteers na nagbuo ng [crowdfunding campaign](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/803171/piso-para-kay-leni) to support her legal fees. anong ginawa niya? at her own personal risk, she politely declined to avoid graft at ipinamahagi lahat ng funds sa angat buhay program, especially sa housing projects sa marawi. see [here](https://gogetfunding.com/piso-para-sa-laban-ni-leni/) for more details. also search for ""jeanette concepcion patindol piso para kay leni"" on facebook. this speaks volumes about her integrity. isa pa, her office consistently received the highest audit rating from coa for [3 straight years](https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2021/6/29/ovp-highest-audit-rating-coa-third-straight-year-.html). ilang beses na tayong umasa sa mga napakagandang pangako ng mga politiko, so it might help if i-apply natin ito sa **lahat** ng ating candidates: kahit gaano kaganda ang mga pangako, plano, at plataporma ng kahit sinong candidate, kahit gaano kagaling siyang magsalita, ka-inspiring ang kaniyang vision, at katindi ng kaniyang political will, ang mas reliable indicator ng kanilang totoong character ay hindi ang kanilang words, hindi rin ang words para sa kanila ng naging allies nila or ng sikat na vloggers or influencers, kundi ang kanilang **past actions**. she takes quick actions. at ang lahat ng ginawa niya bilang vp ay **initiatives** lang niya o kusang loob—hindi part ng mandates ng ovp—dahil siya ay isang servant leader. &nbsp; ##3. history is written by the victors! &nbsp; *""napakarami namang infrastructures ang ginawa noon. binenta ng mga dilawan ang mga pagmamayari ng bayan!""* paglilinaw: ang ""history is written by the victors"" and ""corrupt naman lahat, at least may nagawa"" ay tinatawag na fallacious generalizations o mga logical fallacy dahil sa insufficient evidence at overreliance on observations o panlabas na nakikita. kailangan natin makita ang bigger picture para malinawan tayo. graduate ako ng economics sa up kaya kahit nasa 30s na ako at nakalimutan ko na most of my lectures on development economics, kahit papaano ay may kamalayan pa rin ako at paggamit ng critical thinking para ma-separate kung ano ang propaganda at hindi, at kung ano ang nangyari sa ekonomiya natin. oo, napakaraming ginawang infrastructures. walang mali dito kung careful at proper ang pag-spend. ang problema ay maraming cases ng overspending dahil sa cronies at mga rushed projects. read more [here](https://newslab.philstar.com/31-years-of-amnesia/building-spree). meron namang magagandang projects gaya ng san juanico bridge, philippine heart center, lung center of the philippines, dams, at napakarami pang iba. 2 dekada ba naman e. kaya lang napakalaking spending din sa failed investments gaya ng controversial bataan nuclear power plant na ang cost sana sa contract ay $0.65 billion pero biglang naging $2.2 billion. read [here](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2017/ph241/camacho2/). ang malala pa ay ang napakalaking ginastos din sa tinatawag na edifices para magmukhang may progress pero in the long run ay hindi masyadong nakatulong sa ating economic growth gaya ng ccp at manila film center. ang problema, ito ay debt-driven o puro galing sa utang sa world bank. mula around $0.6 billion utang bago maluklok si marcos, naging $26.7b pagkatapos. read [here](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/774774/well-pay-marcos-debt-until-2025). paano natin malalaman kung **overall** ay maganda ang investments natin sa infrastructure? ito ay kung lumago nga ang ating economy. matapos ang 2 dekadang pamumuno niya, anong nangyari sa economy natin? do marcos apologists give you any economic data, kahit ano gaya ng yearly gdp growth rate, o sinasabi lang nila na ""naramdaman at nakita"" nila ang progress at prosperity noon? oo, maganda naman talaga ang simula, pero tignan natin ang long-term effects. tinatawag nila itong ""golden age"" kahit nag-collapse ang economy natin sa early 1980s dahil hindi na tayo makabayad ng utang sa world bank at nagka-recession during his term. see [this image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ekhz98nz5fx8pzqe8306y7-csjhawppy/view) (verifiable at the psa website) sa gdp growth rate ng economy natin under marcos and a more detailed analysis [here](https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/money/content/172779/martial-law-costly-lessons-in-economic-development/story/). ang problema kasi, pinagbabasihan lang nila ang mga nakita nila at own experiences lang. oo, maganda at payapa ang buhay nila, pero hindi nila nire-represent ang buong bansa. bagsak ang economy leading to massive **inflation**, tapos isisisi nila lahat sa next admins. sobrang negative din ng tingin ng marami sa privatization o pagbenta ng government firms kaya isisisi nila lahat sa aquinos, pero may times na mas efficient pa mag-manage ng business ang private sector, kasi nag-invest sila mismo, kumpira sa government na may inefficiencies and red tape. halimbawa, ang bangui windmill farm ay owned and managed by a private corporation. hindi ako dilawan dahil wala naman talagang perfect na adminstration—may injustices din under the aquinos—pero sana aware tayo na iniwan ni marcos na sobrang lubog ang bansa sa utang or [high debt-to-gdp ratio](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gbnetxycvytwzr2_sd_7jod2qdv7klda/view?usp=drivesdk) at bagsak ang ekonomiya. ang privatization ay kahit papaano nakatulong ma-manage ang ating utang. sana wag magbase lang sa outward appearances or facades of progress. tignan natin ang mas malawak na konteksto kung bakit talagang napag-iwanan tayo. at kahit gaano kagaling ang isang leader (kahit pa may photographic memory siya), kagaling siyang magsalita, ka-inspiring ang kaniyang vision, o katindi ng kaniyang political will, ito ang hard lesson sa atin: competence is important but not as important as character. &nbsp; ##4. puro charity lang yan si leni! band-aid solution. di yan para sa long-term progress ng bansa natin! &nbsp; paglilinaw: hindi naman dahil nag-take siya ng initiatives na tumulong ay ibig sabihin noon ay wala siyang kamalayan sa long-term na makakatulong sa economic growth. hindi vp ang nagco-control ng spending natin sa infrastructure. pero graduate si leni ng economics sa up diliman. alam niya ang kahalagahan ng infrastructure kaya itutuloy niya ang [build, build, build](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2021/10/29/2137559/robredo-says-continue-anti-drug-campaign-build-build-build-tweaks?fbclid=iwar12u_l5gubhl7f35bzxzqyu3esc2t965enw7pwpvyxzyhdzq_zfjhiff6s) pero makikinig din siya sa ating best civil engineers para ma-address for example ang ating traffic and congestion sa urban areas. nakita rin natin ang kaniyang efficient management of resources at [achievements](https://www.reddit.com/r/leni2022/comments/qkl0wk/megathread_achievements_and_statements_of_maria/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) as vp kahit relatively maliit ang budget na inilaan sa ovp. at makikinig din siya sa mga experts and our best economists. ang kaibahan sa kaniya, mas confident tayo na hindi niya nanakawan ang kaban ng bayan. alam din natin na maglalagay siya ng professional leaders na nararapat sa bawat department, hindi yung nilagay lang dahil sa pabor o para ma-enforce ang kapangyarihan. &nbsp; ##5. bayaran ang media! &nbsp; paglilinaw: oo, hindi perfect ang media, pero unlike most vloggers na clearly biased, ang media ay much more under threat na mahabla o maaaring makulong kung lumabag ito sa batas. let me illustrate: in case lang naman na sobra kang amazed o hanga kay bbm for ""his"" bangui windmill farm, let's get the facts right. oo, ina-acknowledge natin na he eagerly permitted, facilitated, and inaugurated its construction according to [this opinion piece](https://manilastandard.net/mobile/article/367795). similar to his parents, alam niya kung gaano kalakas ng hatak ng votes ng sights of [big infrastructures](https://opinion.inquirer.net/145027/our-infrastructure-fetish). gamit na gamit nga sa campaign niya halos lahat ng videos ay may kasamang windmill animation. pero tandaan din na ito ay initiated, constructed, and financed not by the government but by the **private sector**. for complete details, see [here](https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=assvkrokksyc&pg=pa83&hl=en&sa=x&ved=2ahukewjdv8ywinvzahuugkykhfugabcq6af6baggeai#v=onepage&q&f=false). pag binasa natin 'yon, si **ferdinand dumlao** ang isa sa nag-initiate ng bangui windmill farm. ngayon itong si **thinking pinoy** inaakusahan niya na mali mag fact-check si rappler. ang claim kasi ni tp ay yung bangui windmill farm ay initiated by bbm dahil si dumlao daw kasi ang ""ilocos norte's provincial special projects manager"" ni bbm. watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bghpacxoxh4&t=14m00s&feature=youtu.be) at the 14:00 mark. pero magkaibang dumlao kasi 'yon. ang under ni bbm ay **hindi** si ferdinand dumlao kundi si **chito** dumlao. read [here](https://www.manilatimes.net/2004/11/23/news/regions/bongbong-furious-at-ilocos-norte-killing-spree/683199). at ang daming naloloko. tandaan, **hindi** reliable source ang napakaraming facebook, youtube, and tiktok videos dahil punong puno ito ng propaganda, ilang taon na. wala sila madalas na reference na binibigay, puro accusation at stories. at kung may reference gaya ni thinking pinoy, mina-manipulate nila to fit their narratives. hindi naman masyadong mahirap pag-isipan kung saan nanggaling ang makinarya ng propaganda. tsaka yung iba rin ay nare-reinforce nalang ng positive feedback ng community nila at ng [dunning kruger effect](https://www.britannica.com/science/dunning-kruger-effect#:~:text=dunning%2dkruger%20effect%2c%20in%20psychology,or%20of%20people%20in%20general). tapos magke-claim ang mga apologist na bayaran ang rappler at abs-cbn na nag-report din naman sa katiwalian under the aquinos at previous admins gaya ng sa mendiola—see this [report by rappler](https://www.rappler.com/nation/mendiola-massacre-anniversary-same-injustices). *hmm... sino kayang candidate na kabaliktaran ni cory at [ipinagtanggol](https://www.manilatimes.net/2016/04/13/news/top-stories/sumilao-farmers-choose-leni/255921) ang mga farmers at mga mahihirap laban sa mga elite?* since they cannot attack the evidence, their tactic is to target the sources (media) at siraan sila. kaya wag naman tayo masyado padala sa mga sikat na influencers gaya ni ka tunying, yung inc na vlogger. ok sana kung mag-cite siya ng sources, kaya lang kadalasan ay chismis style lang. pero mabait naman siya, misinformed nga lang din at feel niya pinagtutulungan siya kaya para sa kaniya, masama tayong lahat. valid naman ang point niya, wag dapat ipairal ang galit. &nbsp; ##edit: i had an idea. what if ang volunteer animators natin ay bumuo ng inspiring video animation, na may nagna-narrate using this explanation? kahit yung 1st, 2nd, at 4th misconceptions lang. para pati yung mga tinatamad magbasa ay ma-enlighten. baka may ma-contact kayo. yung with inspiring music gaya ng kay william capistrano et al. tapos gawing ad. suggestion lang naman. 🙂 &nbsp; **sa counterarguments:** feel free to comment your criticisms and counterarguments. please include suggestions so we can engage in civil discourse at ma-edit and improve pa natin itong mga paglilinaw. &nbsp; **sa gustong mag-contribute ng sarili nilang paglilinaw sa comments:** use this format. *misconception:* *paglilinaw:* &nbsp; **sa mga bukas ang mata:** alam nating she is facing an uphill battle for our nation. kaya nananawagan ako na habang may oras pa, tumindig tayo at humakbang para sa bayan. sa kabila ng takot, sa gitna ng magulong politika at malakas na ingay ng propaganda, let us amplify [the voice of reason](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/mobile/folders/19vdfrfqgfboq0kwqcdiuqydtn_dsoaal?usp=drive_fs) at ating patunayan ang ating malasakit sa bayan.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/qx82zk/replying_to_misinformation_against_leni/,19 11 2021

Singsing,"mapait akong napangiti nang mapansin ko ang dalawang magkasintahan sa aking harapan. kitang kita ko ang saya sa mga mata ng babae at kung gaano kasincere ang lalaki kung tumingin sa kanya. napatikhim ako at nag-iwas ng tingin ng maramdam kong humapdi ang aking mga mata. dahil ibig ibig ko nang maiyak ng magbalik sa aking ala-ala ang nakaraan. \~ ""mailene!"" saway sa'kin ni ron nang nakawan ko siya ng halik sa kanyang pisngi. masaya kaming nagkakantahan at nagkekwentuhan sa loob ng kanyang sasakyan. binabaybay ang daan patungo sa batangas. ""what? ayaw mo ba na halikan kita?"" nakalabi kong tugon rito at nagcross arms sa kanya. sumilay ang kanyang matatamis na ngiti at kinuha ang aking kaliwang kamay kahit nagmamaneho siya. ""of course not!"" mabilis na sagot nito at saka dinugtong ""gustong gusto kong hinahalikan mo ako, gustong gusto ko yang labi mo kaya dapat kapag hahalikan mo ako yung siguradong nakaharap ako sayo ha?"" idiniin niya ang haplos sa aking palad at hinalikan ang likod nito. namula ako sa kanyang sinabi at tumango. huminto siya saglit sa pagmamaneho at hinatak niya ako palapit sa kanya at masuyong hinalikan ang aking labi. \~ napahugot ako ng malalim na hininga ng maalala ko ang mukha ni ron. napatingin ako sa singsing kong suot at di ko namalayan na basa na pala ang aking mga pisngi dahil sa luha. tumingin ako muli sa magkasintahan sa aking harapan at napangiti sa kanila. sana'y magtagal ang kanilang relasyon. hinatak ko na ang tali ng jeep at agad pumara ng makita ko na nandito na pala ako sa aking bababaan. sinuyod ko ng tingin ang pet shop at tumingin ulit sa aking cellphone upang tingnan ang message na kakatanggap ko lang.

""alex naman."" nakanguso kong tawag dito. he smirked at me at ginulo ang aking buhok. ""ron will be happy, mailene. gusto niya makitang masaya kayo ng anak mo."" sumikip ang dibdib ko sa kanyang sinabi. pinisil niya ang aking pisngi at inabot sakin ang cage upang mabuhat si ruine. alex is ron's bestfriend. siya ang naging father figure ni ruine. siya ang kasama ko noong nanganak ako, siya ang kasama ko ng unang beses magsalita ang anak ko ng ""mama"", siya ang kasama ko noong sinugod ko sa hospital si ruine ng lagnatin ito. si alex ang nagbantay sa amin ni ruine. kahit kailan ay hindi siya umalis sa tabi ko. itinaas ko ang cage na aking hawak at kinausap ang rabbit sa loob nito. ""katulad mo ako, nakakulong ka sa cage at nakakulong ako sa nakaraan."" napakagat labi ako ng marinig ko ang hagikgik ni ruine, napatingin ako sa likuran ni alex at buhat buhat niya ang aking anak. kitang kita ang saya ni ruine sa kanyang tito alex. humalik ito sa pisngi ng kanyang tito at ngumiti muli. sumunod na ako sa sasakyan ni alex, pinaupo niya ako sa passenger seat at inayos niya ang uupuan ni ruine sa likod katabi ang rabbit nito. sumakay na si alex at pinaandar ang sasakyan. nagulat ako ng kunin niya ang aking kamay kaya binawi ko ito sa kanya. ""pasensya na mai"" ngiting malungkot sakin ni alex ngunit di na ako tumugon. tumingin ako sa labas ng bintana habang dinarama ko ang singsing sa aking palasingsingan. \~ ""i promise, ikaw at ikaw lang sa buhay ko mailene."" pangako ni ron sa akin at isinuot sa akin ang singsing na napili niya. ""di pa nga ako nagsasabi ng yes eh!"" maktol ko rito pero nangingiti dahil parang sasabog ang puso ko. ""mahal, di mo man sabihin. alam ko, ramdam ko. pero magtatanong na lang ako ulit ha?"" napakagat ako ng labi ng pumunta siya sa aking likuran. papalubog na ang araw, nakatanaw sa karagatan. nagulat ako ng may naramdaman akong malamig sa aking leeg kasabay ng pagpatak ng luha ko ng may mga lobong paangat at nakasabit rito ang mga salitang... ""will you marry me, mailene?"" ikinabit niya sa leeg ko ang kwintas at iniharap niya ako sa kanya. ""yes, i will marry you ron."" sagot ko sa pagitan ng aking hikbi dahil sa sobrang saya ng aking nararamdaman. mabalis natapos ang aming maghapon sa batanggas at bumalik na sa manila upang ibalita sa kanila ang plano namin ni ron. magkahawak kamay kami. panaka-naka ang tingin niya sa singsing na suot ko. napangiti ako at humarap sa kanya. ""mahal, may surprise ako sayo."" haplos ko sa kanyang pisngi at ngumiti. ""what is it hmm?"" sumulyap siya sakin at hinalikan ang aking kamay. ""i will tell you late--"" hindi ko na natapos ang aking sasabihin ng makaramdam ako ng hapdi sa aking buong katawan, nakakabingi ang ingay, sobrang labo ng paligid, hindi ko makita si ron, hindi ko maramdaman ang aking katawan. napahawak ako sa aking tyan. ""no, please no."" pinilit kong imulat ang aking mata at natanaw ko si ron sa gitna ng kalsada ""ron!"" sigaw ko rito pero hindi ko marinig ang boses ko. ""ron, please!"" sigaw ko pero hindi siya gumagalaw.

"In the Philippines, What's your most favorite overused Networking/MLM lines or quotes that they usually used when inviting a new member to join them?","i've been a part of **usana, frontrow, uno, emgoldex, kapa** and many more to mention. the only cult (group) that i had succeeded the most (in terms of financial gain) is kapa, probably because i joined them late 2017 nung hindi pa sila mainit sa mata ng government. by the time na na shutdown na sila nakuha ko na ng more than 10x yung ininvest ko. these are some of the things i can remember coming out of their mouth while inviting a newbie: 1.

"alex, tanghaling tapat ng sabado, 2021","(any review for this is very-very much appreciated. i'm an aspiring writer po and i just launched a passion project anthology, isa po ito sa mga kwento) &#x200b; **chairman** ngayon ko lang naranasan ‘to sa tagal ko nang nanunungkulan sa barangay. isama mo na sa mga karanasang ‘yon ang lahat ng away mag-asawa, suntukan ng mga lasing, at mga batang ginagahasa sa bukiran. pero eto… ngayon ko lang napansin na buong araw ko na palang hinihimas ang rosaryong nakasabit sa leeg ko. maya’t-maya ko pa hinahalikan at binubulungan na sana’y wag mangyari sa pamilya ko ang nakita ko kanina. naririnig ko pa rin ang sigaw ni cecil, kumare’t-kapitbahay namin, tanghaling tapat ng sabado, kung saan ang tanghalian sa buong kalsada nami’y naantala dahil sa kanyang nakakakilabot na sigaw. sa ilalim ng nagbabagang init ay nagsitakbuhan kami upang sumaklolo. kinailangan ko pang iwanan ang tinola ni misis at ang isang basong softdrinks na nilalanguyan pa dalawang yelo nang ako’y tumakbo papunta sa bahay ni cecil. ngayo’y hindi pa rin ako kumakain. sa totoo nga’y hindi pa ako nakakaranas ng gutom. hindi ko pa ata kaya. sa bahay ni cecil ay dinatnan namin ang katawan ng panganay ni cecil na si joe na nakaratay sa braso ng kanyang bunsong kapatid na si alex, sa sahig ng kanilang sala. sa leeg ni joe ay nakabaon ang basag na bote na ginamit ni alex na balot na balot sa dugo ng kanyang kapatid. agad ang kapit at halik ko sa aking rosaryo nang makita ko ang imahe; na parang sinaunang obra na naglalahad ng malagim na kwento. pero ano ang kwento neto? hanggang ngayon ay wala pa rin kaming ideya kung bakit. magmula sa pagsigaw ni cecil ng, “anong nangyari?! anak, anong nangyari?!” sa tulalang alex na nakatitig sa dilat na mga mata ni joe, hanggang sa pagpunta namin dito sa aking opisina sa barangay, ay wala pa rin kaming makuhang rason mula sa bakit. sa isang maliit na kwarto sa aking opisina’y pinaupo ko muna si alex. tulala at sinusubukang burahin ang dugo sa kanyang mukha gamit ang duguan ring damit n’ya. hinainan ko ng isang bote ng softdrinks at tatlong pandesal mula pa sa agahan namin kanina si alex, na agad namang n’yang kinain ng walang pag-aalinlangan. dito na nagsimulang gumapang ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod. isang kilabot na hindi ko maipaliwanag, habang pinapanood ko si alex na walang awat sa pagkain, habang ako’y hindi ko pa rin magawang matakam sa masarap na lutong nag-aabang sa’kin sa bahay. “alex,” marahan kong sinabi. “ba’t mo ginawa ‘yun?” tumingin lamang sa’kin si alex, patay na mga mata, bibig na mabagal ang nguya. at sa kanyang paglunok ay walang mga salitang bumalik sa’kin. hindi ko alam kung bakit pero bigla kong naalala si jefferson, isang tricycle driver dito sa’min. dalawang taon na ang nakakalipas nang mapatay n’ya ang isang dayo na nakaaway n’ya sa kalsada. nangyari ‘to nang kamuntikan n’yang makasalpukan ang sasakyan ng dayo, at nang nahinto silang dalawa’y nagkasagutan muna sila bago mapikon si jefferson. hinampas n’ya ng bakal na tubo ang dayo. hindi na raw n’ya napigilan dahil sa mga mapanglait na mga salitang tinawag sa kanya. bobo, unggoy, uling, mababa. labing-isang beses paulit-ulit na hinampas ni jefferson sa ulo ang dayo, at sa sobrang lakas ng bawat hampas ay may parte na ng utak na lumabas dito. sa prisinto’y naalala ko si jefferson, iyak nang iyak at humihingi ng tawad dahil sa nangyari. hindi makakain, hindi rin makatulog. nilamon na s’ya ng konsensya n’ya, at ang konsensya n’ya ang tumulak sa kanya na agawin ang baril ng isa sa mga pulis na nagbabantay, at iputok sa kanyang sariling ulo. nasaktan si jefferson, nagalit, at di nakapagpigil. naintindihan ko ang kwento ‘nun. pero bakit hindi ko maintindihan ‘to? alam kong magkasundo ang magkapatid na ‘to. alam ko kung ga’no sila kalapit sa isa’t-isa. kaya pa’no nangyari ‘to? ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod ay gumagapang paakyat hanggang sa aking dibdib, tila ba kumakapit ng mahigpit. pasikip nang pasikip at medyo nahihirapan akong huminga. ang kakaibang pakiramdam na ‘to’y tumitindi habang nanatiling tahimik at nakatitig lamang sa’kin si alex. biglang iniabot ni alex ang kanyang kamay at dito tumalon na ang puso ko. napaatras ako sa aking kinauupuan, at mabilisan kong hinugot ang aking rosaryo mula sa pagkakatago nito sa aking damit. itinutok ko ito kay alex, na walang ibang kibo kun’di ang kunin ang bote ng softdrinks na nasa harapan n’ya. mas bumilis pa ang pagkatok sa aking dibdib, na para bang kamuntikan na kong mamatay. habang si alex nama’y pinapanood lang ako habang patuloy ang kanyang pag-inom. wala nga ata talagang mangyayari, at nang maramdaman ko kung gaano katahimik ang kwarto’y kumalma na ako. bakit sa dulo ng utak ko’y hinihiling ko na may sapi o di kaya’y isang demonyo talaga ang kaharap ko, at sa presensya ng aking rosaryo’y masasaktan s’ya. kahit anong kakaiba. kahit ano basta magkaroon lang ng eksplenasyon ang nangyari. pero siguro’y kakaiba na rin ang ikinikilos ng bata. at siguro nga’y mas dapat talaga akong matakot sa buhay kaysa sa patay. **cecil** “saan ba ko nagkulang?” tanong ni aling cecil sa mga kumare n’yang nakapalibot sa kanya sa masikip na opisina ni chairmain. napapaligiran din s’ya ng makukulay na mga pamaypay na hindi sabay-sabay ang pagaspas sa harap n’ya; nilulunod si aling cecil sa hangin. ang kanyang mukha nama’y tila ba isang rebulto ng santo kung punas-punasan ng mga panyo. “hindi ko pa rin maintindihan,” dugtong n’ya. “hindi naman ako nagkulang sa aruga. pareho ko namang pinapakita sa kanila na pantay ang pagmamahal ko sa kanila.” tuyo na ang mga mata ni aling cecil, ngunit tila ba hindi pa rin tapos ang kanyang pag-iyak. “hindi sila nag-aaway. hindi ko man lang narinig na nagtalo silang dalawa. o kung may pagtatalo man, malamang sa malamang maliit na bagay lang ‘yun. hindi yung ikakamatay mo!” isang labi ng lumapit sa tenga ni aling cecil, “alam mo tingin ko, baka inggit ‘yan. kasi si joe lang may trabaho sa kanilang dalawa, di ba? tapos si alex, wala pa rin sa kolehiyo. nag-aaral pa rin. sigurado akong ‘yun ang dahilan.” isa pang labi ang lumapit sa kabilang tenga naman ni aling cecil, “baka napikon na. kasi di ba halos s’ya na sa lahat ng gawaing bahay? baka pakiramdam n’ya porke’t mas malaki ambag ng kapatid n’ya , alila na s’ya neto.” isang labi naman na kaharap ni aling cecil ang nagsabing, “baka nagbabait-baitan lang kasi nga si joe ang halos sumasalo sa mga bayarin, pati sa pag-aaral n’ya. pero galit talaga s’ya, kasi baka naman may pagkakataong mas nabibigyang-atensyon si joe kahit hindi n’yo napapansin. kasi halimbawa uuwi s’yang pagod galing sa trabaho, syempre di n’yo maiwasang alagaan, pagsilbihan.” sa gitna ng mga labing ito’y si aling cecil, at ang ideyang unti-unting nabubuo dahil sa mga sinasabi ng mga labi sa kanya. “siguro,” sabi n’ya. “siguro nga.” **abbie** ang pangalan n’ya’y abbie. social worker daw s’ya. pagpasok n’ya’y agad bumungad sa’kin ang asul na bra sa ilalim ng dilaw na blouse nang tapatan ito ng liwanag mula sa bintanang katabi ko. sa kanyang pagtali ng buhok ay nakita kong basang-basa na ang kanyang kili-kili at kumikinang na sa pawis ang kanyang leeg. “alex?” sabi n’ya habang maya’t-mayang tinutulak ng kanyang daliri ang salamin n’yang dumudulas sa kanyang matangos na ilong. “bakit di mo ikwento muna sa’kin ang nangyari bago tayo umalis dito?” pasensya ka na, abbie. hindi ko nagawang sabihin kay chairman, na kilala pa mandin namin. hinding-hindi ko rin masasabi sa’yo. walang ibang maglalahad ng nangyari kun’di ang mga taong nais magbigay kahulugan dito, kasi kung ako tatanungin kung bakit, sa totoo lang, hindi ko rin alam ang isasagot. may nabasag akong bote sa kusina kanina, at sa pagpulot ko nito’y pumasok sa isip ko ang isang udyok. yung tipo ng udyok kapag nasa mataas kang lugar, at bigla mo na lang gustong itulak ang kasama mo. pero alam mong hindi ito dapat gawin, at kakapit ka pa nang mas mahigpit sa kanila para masiguro mong hindi ito mangyayari. ang udyok na ito’y nagsabi sa’kin na isaksak ko kay kuya ang basag na bote. at nalaman ko na lang na totoo na pala ang lahat nang dumapo sa aking balat ang mainit na dugo ni kuya. nahinto lang ako nang maramdaman ko ang buto sa leeg n’ya at nang marinig kong nabibilaukan na s’ya sa kanyang sariling dugo. hindi ko pa rin alam kung bakit. sana, tulad ng iniisip ni chairman, ay nasapian na nga lang ako. pero nakita ko ang lahat, andun ako. hindi ko lang alam na totoo pala ang lahat. namatay si kuya joe sa wala. at hindi ko matanggap na wala. normal lang sana ang sabado namin. tahimik. nanonood lang si kuya ng tv, naglilinis ako sa kusina. si nanay nama’y namamalengke ng pananghalian namin. bicol express daw ang lulutuin n’ya. puta, sinira ko ang araw. gusto kong umiyak dahil hindi na kami babalik sa salo-salo namin. “alex?” muling tawag ni abbie. “gusto kong malaman kung bakit. tayong dalawa lang. kaibigan mo ko dito. hinding-hindi ko ‘to sasabihin sa nanay mo, sa mga kapitbahay n’yo. may mga naririnig ako sa labas na dahil daw sa inggit? totoo ba ‘to? sa inggit nga? magmula nang dinala ako ni chairman dito sa maliit na kwartong ito’y napagpasyahan kong manahimik na lang sa nangyari. sa ngayo’y nilalabanan ko ang mga luha, nilalabanan ko ang panginginig ng aking bibig, at ang mga salitang gustong lumabas mula sa’kin. dapat mukhang hindi ko pinagsisisihan. dapat mukha akong galit. para naman mabigyang halaga, mabigyan ng ibig-sabihin ang pagkamatay ni kuya joe. dapat tinatatak ko sa utak ko na dapat lang! dapat lang sa kanya ang nangyari. dapat hindi ako bibigay. dahil kapag natalo ako, mamatay talaga sa wala si kuya. “sige, kung ayaw mong magkwento, ako muna. kasi naalala ko ‘tong isang batang babae at ang tatay n’yang abusado. tatay n’yang lasinggero. tatay n’yang isang beses s’yang hinipuan sa kanyang sariling kwarto at pinilit. ampon ang batang ‘yon, at tatay-tatayan n’ya lang etong umaabuso sa kanya. takot na takot ang bata dahil pakiramdam n’ya isang gabi’y papatayin na lang s’ya bigla neto. kaya naman isang gabi, nang bigla s’yang pinuntahan ng kanyang tatay upang pagsamantalahan ulit, sinasaksak ito ng bata gamit ang lapis sa mata, sa leeg, at sa dibdib.” kumuha ng panyo si abbie. sa kanyang paggalaw ay muling sumisilip ang kanyang bra sa likod ng blouse na parang mga batang naglalaro sa likod ng kurtina. “masarap sa pakiramdam, pero pumapatay pa rin s’ya ng tao. ilan taon n’yang dinibdib ‘yun. hanggang ngayon nararamdaman pa rin n’ya ang mga kamay ng tatay n’ya sa kanyang ari. sa kanyang dibdib. ilang taon bago n’ya matanggap ang ginawa n’ya. ngayon, medyo mahirap pa ring ikwento, pero kahit papaano’y kaya ko na. nangyari na kasi.” para bang may sumuntok sa aking dibdib nang marinig ko ‘to. bigla kong tinanggal ang aking paningin sa kanyang bra, at sa paggalaw ng aking mga mata’y bigla kong naramdaman ang pamumuo ng mga luha. “ayos lang, alex. pero andito lang ako. aalagaan ka muna namin. tapos pag handa ka na, makikinig ako. kahit pakonte-konte pa, ayos lang. aantayin kong mabuo ang kwento mo.” bumibilis bigla ang tibok ng puso ko. lalong nanginginig ang aking labi. at biglang pumasok si kuya sa isip ko, tumatakbo papalayo sa akin. mga bata pa kami, at hinahabol ko s’ya. “alex?” kuya wag kang lumayo! “alex?” kuya dito ka lang! kailangan kita dito! “sige, ayusin na natin pag-alis mo.” at parang isang batang nadapa sa semento, dito na walang awat na tumulo ang luha sa aking mga mata. “alex?” “hindi ko rin alam… hindi… ko rin alam. sorry, kuya! sorry! hindi ko rin alam kung bakit! patayin n’yo na lang ako! hindi ko alam anong nangyari! hindi ko na kaya!” lumalabo na ang aking paningin, pero kahit ga’no kalabo ang aking mga mata’y kitang-kita ko ang gulat at takot sa mukha ni abbie. pasensya ka na, kuya.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/nlygsa/alex_tanghaling_tapat_ng_sabado_2021/,27 05 2021

&nbsp; paglilinaw: ang hindrance sa ating progress na humihila sa'tin pababa ay hindi ang criticism o pagpuna sa'ting government officials, kundi ang ating intolerance at galit sa criticism. maganda ang sinabi sa [article na ito](https://www.manilatimes.net/2020/03/19/opinion/columnists/topanalysis/criticizing-as-a-form-of-civic-duty/704176). habang hindi naman tayo gumagawa ng threats o nagdudulot ng harm sa'ting kapuwa, walang masama sa pag-express ng frustrations o konting humor sa mga mali sa ating lipunan at gobyerno. mas ok pa rin yung aware tayo kesa magpikit mata tayo na parang mas mahal na natin ang isang public servant kaysa sa bayan. balansihin din natin. hindi ito pagrebelde o pakikipaglaban sa gobyerno, kundi pag-call out ng inefficiencies at incompetence, at pagsuporta na rin sa checks and balances ng ating lipunan para hindi maabuso ang kapangyarihan. at hindi komo nagrereklamo, hindi ibig sabihin wala tayong ibang ginagawa. si leni nga andaming reklamo ng lugaw na yan, pero halos araw-araw ring nagtrabaho simula day 1. ang gusto lang namin kay leni, kahit kailan hindi siya pagalit mag-voice out ng criticism at malumanay siyang nagbibigay ng suggestions for improvement. kaya marami rin ang akala ay mahina at walang political will si leni kasi malumanay siya. pero hindi siya mahina kundi matapang. isipin mo, presidente na mismo ang pinupuna niya, kahit alam niya ang negative effect sa image at popularity niya dahil alam naman niya ang kultura nating mga pinoy na napaka-allergic sa criticism. kita naman natin ang backlash sa facebook posts niya na flooded ng laugh reacts at toxic comments. pero bakit ba talaga si leni nagvo-voice out? ramdam niya ang mga hinanakit ng taong bayan kasi andun siya mismo parati sa ground at may kamalayan siya sa kalagayan ng mga tao. like yung pag-una pa sa dolomite sand, sabi niya ito raw ay [insensitive](https://mb.com.ph/2020/09/08/manila-bay-white-beach-an-insensitive-plan-in-time-of-pandemic-solon/) kasi magbuhos sana dapat muna ng lahat ng resources at attention sa pandemic, which is a valid point 'di ba? dahil alam niyang kapag mas mabilis maka-return to normal ang labor force natin, mas mabilis aangat muli ang ekonomiya natin. &nbsp; ##2. puppet si leni ng oligarchs! &nbsp; paglilinaw: unlike sa panahon ni cory na may injustices laban sa mga magsasaka, kahit bago pa si leni tumakbo for any public office, no political plans or agenda, bilang lawyer ay mahusay niyang ipinagtanggol na pro bono (walang bayad) ang maraming marginalized sectors. halimbawa ay ang paglaban niya para sa mga lupa ng sumilao farmers against sa conglomerate by the name of san miguel corporation. naipanalo nila ang kaso laban sa mga elite. kaya hindi nakakapagtaka kung bakit todo ang suporta sa kaniya ng mga [sumilao farmers](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/779322/sumilao-farmers-to-march-not-for-land-but-for-robredo). iba iba rin ang ugali ng individual na members ng mga partido, hindi lahat masama o lahat mabuti. halimbawa, sina cory at duterte ay parehas na kabilang sa pdp-laban, na sinimulan naman ni ninoy. kakapalit lang din ni sara recently. makikita rin natin sa saln ni leni na hindi siya kasing yaman ng most politicians, kaya noong sinampahan siya ng kaso ni bbm, may volunteers na nagbuo ng [crowdfunding campaign](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/803171/piso-para-kay-leni) to support her legal fees. anong ginawa niya? at her own personal risk, she politely declined to avoid graft at ipinamahagi lahat ng funds sa angat buhay program, especially sa housing projects sa marawi. see [here](https://gogetfunding.com/piso-para-sa-laban-ni-leni/) for more details. also search for ""jeanette concepcion patindol piso para kay leni"" on facebook. this speaks volumes about her integrity. isa pa, her office consistently received the highest audit rating from coa for [3 straight years](https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2021/6/29/ovp-highest-audit-rating-coa-third-straight-year-.html). ilang beses na tayong umasa sa mga napakagandang pangako ng mga politiko, so it might help if i-apply natin ito sa **lahat** ng ating candidates: kahit gaano kaganda ang mga pangako, plano, at plataporma ng kahit sinong candidate, kahit gaano kagaling siyang magsalita, ka-inspiring ang kaniyang vision, at katindi ng kaniyang political will, ang mas reliable indicator ng kanilang totoong character ay hindi ang kanilang words, hindi rin ang words para sa kanila ng naging allies nila or ng sikat na vloggers or influencers, kundi ang kanilang **past actions**. she takes quick actions. at ang lahat ng ginawa niya bilang vp ay **initiatives** lang niya o kusang loob—hindi part ng mandates ng ovp—dahil siya ay isang servant leader. &nbsp; ##3. history is written by the victors! &nbsp; *""napakarami namang infrastructures ang ginawa noon. binenta ng mga dilawan ang mga pagmamayari ng bayan!""* paglilinaw: ang ""history is written by the victors"" and ""corrupt naman lahat, at least may nagawa"" ay tinatawag na fallacious generalizations o mga logical fallacy dahil sa insufficient evidence at overreliance on observations o panlabas na nakikita. kailangan natin makita ang bigger picture para malinawan tayo. graduate ako ng economics sa up kaya kahit nasa 30s na ako at nakalimutan ko na most of my lectures on development economics, kahit papaano ay may kamalayan pa rin ako at paggamit ng critical thinking para ma-separate kung ano ang propaganda at hindi, at kung ano ang nangyari sa ekonomiya natin. oo, napakaraming ginawang infrastructures. walang mali dito kung careful at proper ang pag-spend. ang problema ay maraming cases ng overspending dahil sa cronies at mga rushed projects. read more [here](https://newslab.philstar.com/31-years-of-amnesia/building-spree). meron namang magagandang projects gaya ng san juanico bridge, philippine heart center, lung center of the philippines, dams, at napakarami pang iba. 2 dekada ba naman e. kaya lang napakalaking spending din sa failed investments gaya ng controversial bataan nuclear power plant na ang cost sana sa contract ay $0.65 billion pero biglang naging $2.2 billion. read [here](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2017/ph241/camacho2/). ang malala pa ay ang napakalaking ginastos din sa tinatawag na edifices para magmukhang may progress pero in the long run ay hindi masyadong nakatulong sa ating economic growth gaya ng ccp at manila film center. ang problema, ito ay debt-driven o puro galing sa utang sa world bank. mula around $0.6 billion utang bago maluklok si marcos, naging $26.7b pagkatapos. read [here](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/774774/well-pay-marcos-debt-until-2025). paano natin malalaman kung **overall** ay maganda ang investments natin sa infrastructure? ito ay kung lumago nga ang ating economy. matapos ang 2 dekadang pamumuno niya, anong nangyari sa economy natin? do marcos apologists give you any economic data, kahit ano gaya ng yearly gdp growth rate, o sinasabi lang nila na ""naramdaman at nakita"" nila ang progress at prosperity noon? oo, maganda naman talaga ang simula, pero tignan natin ang long-term effects. tinatawag nila itong ""golden age"" kahit nag-collapse ang economy natin sa early 1980s dahil hindi na tayo makabayad ng utang sa world bank at nagka-recession during his term. see [this image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ekhz98nz5fx8pzqe8306y7-csjhawppy/view) (verifiable at the psa website) sa gdp growth rate ng economy natin under marcos and a more detailed analysis [here](https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/money/content/172779/martial-law-costly-lessons-in-economic-development/story/). ang problema kasi, pinagbabasihan lang nila ang mga nakita nila at own experiences lang. oo, maganda at payapa ang buhay nila, pero hindi nila nire-represent ang buong bansa. bagsak ang economy leading to massive **inflation**, tapos isisisi nila lahat sa next admins. sobrang negative din ng tingin ng marami sa privatization o pagbenta ng government firms kaya isisisi nila lahat sa aquinos, pero may times na mas efficient pa mag-manage ng business ang private sector, kasi nag-invest sila mismo, kumpira sa government na may inefficiencies and red tape. halimbawa, ang bangui windmill farm ay owned and managed by a private corporation. hindi ako dilawan dahil wala naman talagang perfect na adminstration—may injustices din under the aquinos—pero sana aware tayo na iniwan ni marcos na sobrang lubog ang bansa sa utang or [high debt-to-gdp ratio](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gbnetxycvytwzr2_sd_7jod2qdv7klda/view?usp=drivesdk) at bagsak ang ekonomiya. ang privatization ay kahit papaano nakatulong ma-manage ang ating utang. sana wag magbase lang sa outward appearances or facades of progress. tignan natin ang mas malawak na konteksto kung bakit talagang napag-iwanan tayo. at kahit gaano kagaling ang isang leader (kahit pa may photographic memory siya), kagaling siyang magsalita, ka-inspiring ang kaniyang vision, o katindi ng kaniyang political will, ito ang hard lesson sa atin: competence is important but not as important as character. &nbsp; ##4. puro charity lang yan si leni! band-aid solution. di yan para sa long-term progress ng bansa natin! &nbsp; paglilinaw: hindi naman dahil nag-take siya ng initiatives na tumulong ay ibig sabihin noon ay wala siyang kamalayan sa long-term na makakatulong sa economic growth. hindi vp ang nagco-control ng spending natin sa infrastructure. pero graduate si leni ng economics sa up diliman. alam niya ang kahalagahan ng infrastructure kaya itutuloy niya ang [build, build, build](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2021/10/29/2137559/robredo-says-continue-anti-drug-campaign-build-build-build-tweaks?fbclid=iwar12u_l5gubhl7f35bzxzqyu3esc2t965enw7pwpvyxzyhdzq_zfjhiff6s) pero makikinig din siya sa ating best civil engineers para ma-address for example ang ating traffic and congestion sa urban areas. nakita rin natin ang kaniyang efficient management of resources at [achievements](https://www.reddit.com/r/leni2022/comments/qkl0wk/megathread_achievements_and_statements_of_maria/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) as vp kahit relatively maliit ang budget na inilaan sa ovp. at makikinig din siya sa mga experts and our best economists. ang kaibahan sa kaniya, mas confident tayo na hindi niya nanakawan ang kaban ng bayan. alam din natin na maglalagay siya ng professional leaders na nararapat sa bawat department, hindi yung nilagay lang dahil sa pabor o para ma-enforce ang kapangyarihan. &nbsp; ##5. bayaran ang media! &nbsp; paglilinaw: oo, hindi perfect ang media, pero unlike most vloggers na clearly biased, ang media ay much more under threat na mahabla o maaaring makulong kung lumabag ito sa batas. let me illustrate: in case lang naman na sobra kang amazed o hanga kay bbm for ""his"" bangui windmill farm, let's get the facts right. oo, ina-acknowledge natin na he eagerly permitted, facilitated, and inaugurated its construction according to [this opinion piece](https://manilastandard.net/mobile/article/367795). similar to his parents, alam niya kung gaano kalakas ng hatak ng votes ng sights of [big infrastructures](https://opinion.inquirer.net/145027/our-infrastructure-fetish). gamit na gamit nga sa campaign niya halos lahat ng videos ay may kasamang windmill animation. pero tandaan din na ito ay initiated, constructed, and financed not by the government but by the **private sector**. for complete details, see [here](https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=assvkrokksyc&pg=pa83&hl=en&sa=x&ved=2ahukewjdv8ywinvzahuugkykhfugabcq6af6baggeai#v=onepage&q&f=false). pag binasa natin 'yon, si **ferdinand dumlao** ang isa sa nag-initiate ng bangui windmill farm. ngayon itong si **thinking pinoy** inaakusahan niya na mali mag fact-check si rappler. ang claim kasi ni tp ay yung bangui windmill farm ay initiated by bbm dahil si dumlao daw kasi ang ""ilocos norte's provincial special projects manager"" ni bbm. watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bghpacxoxh4&t=14m00s&feature=youtu.be) at the 14:00 mark. pero magkaibang dumlao kasi 'yon. ang under ni bbm ay **hindi** si ferdinand dumlao kundi si **chito** dumlao. read [here](https://www.manilatimes.net/2004/11/23/news/regions/bongbong-furious-at-ilocos-norte-killing-spree/683199). at ang daming naloloko. tandaan, **hindi** reliable source ang napakaraming facebook, youtube, and tiktok videos dahil punong puno ito ng propaganda, ilang taon na. wala sila madalas na reference na binibigay, puro accusation at stories. at kung may reference gaya ni thinking pinoy, mina-manipulate nila to fit their narratives. hindi naman masyadong mahirap pag-isipan kung saan nanggaling ang makinarya ng propaganda. tsaka yung iba rin ay nare-reinforce nalang ng positive feedback ng community nila at ng [dunning kruger effect](https://www.britannica.com/science/dunning-kruger-effect#:~:text=dunning%2dkruger%20effect%2c%20in%20psychology,or%20of%20people%20in%20general). tapos magke-claim ang mga apologist na bayaran ang rappler at abs-cbn na nag-report din naman sa katiwalian under the aquinos at previous admins gaya ng sa mendiola—see this [report by rappler](https://www.rappler.com/nation/mendiola-massacre-anniversary-same-injustices). *hmm... sino kayang candidate na kabaliktaran ni cory at [ipinagtanggol](https://www.manilatimes.net/2016/04/13/news/top-stories/sumilao-farmers-choose-leni/255921) ang mga farmers at mga mahihirap laban sa mga elite?* since they cannot attack the evidence, their tactic is to target the sources (media) at siraan sila. kaya wag naman tayo masyado padala sa mga sikat na influencers gaya ni ka tunying, yung inc na vlogger. ok sana kung mag-cite siya ng sources, kaya lang kadalasan ay chismis style lang. pero mabait naman siya, misinformed nga lang din at feel niya pinagtutulungan siya kaya para sa kaniya, masama tayong lahat. valid naman ang point niya, wag dapat ipairal ang galit. &nbsp; ##edit: i had an idea. what if ang volunteer animators natin ay bumuo ng inspiring video animation, na may nagna-narrate using this explanation? kahit yung 1st, 2nd, at 4th misconceptions lang. para pati yung mga tinatamad magbasa ay ma-enlighten. baka may ma-contact kayo. yung with inspiring music gaya ng kay william capistrano et al. tapos gawing ad. suggestion lang naman. 🙂 &nbsp; **sa counterarguments:** feel free to comment your criticisms and counterarguments. please include suggestions so we can engage in civil discourse at ma-edit and improve pa natin itong mga paglilinaw. &nbsp; **sa gustong mag-contribute ng sarili nilang paglilinaw sa comments:** use this format. *misconception:* *paglilinaw:* &nbsp; **sa mga bukas ang mata:** alam nating she is facing an uphill battle for our nation. kaya nananawagan ako na habang may oras pa, tumindig tayo at humakbang para sa bayan. sa kabila ng takot, sa gitna ng magulong politika at malakas na ingay ng propaganda, let us amplify [the voice of reason](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/mobile/folders/19vdfrfqgfboq0kwqcdiuqydtn_dsoaal?usp=drive_fs) at ating patunayan ang ating malasakit sa bayan.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/qx82zk/replying_to_misinformation_against_leni/,19 11 2021

Singsing,"mapait akong napangiti nang mapansin ko ang dalawang magkasintahan sa aking harapan. kitang kita ko ang saya sa mga mata ng babae at kung gaano kasincere ang lalaki kung tumingin sa kanya. napatikhim ako at nag-iwas ng tingin ng maramdam kong humapdi ang aking mga mata. dahil ibig ibig ko nang maiyak ng magbalik sa aking ala-ala ang nakaraan. \~ ""mailene!"" saway sa'kin ni ron nang nakawan ko siya ng halik sa kanyang pisngi. masaya kaming nagkakantahan at nagkekwentuhan sa loob ng kanyang sasakyan. binabaybay ang daan patungo sa batangas. ""what? ayaw mo ba na halikan kita?"" nakalabi kong tugon rito at nagcross arms sa kanya. sumilay ang kanyang matatamis na ngiti at kinuha ang aking kaliwang kamay kahit nagmamaneho siya. ""of course not!"" mabilis na sagot nito at saka dinugtong ""gustong gusto kong hinahalikan mo ako, gustong gusto ko yang labi mo kaya dapat kapag hahalikan mo ako yung siguradong nakaharap ako sayo ha?"" idiniin niya ang haplos sa aking palad at hinalikan ang likod nito. namula ako sa kanyang sinabi at tumango. huminto siya saglit sa pagmamaneho at hinatak niya ako palapit sa kanya at masuyong hinalikan ang aking labi. \~ napahugot ako ng malalim na hininga ng maalala ko ang mukha ni ron. napatingin ako sa singsing kong suot at di ko namalayan na basa na pala ang aking mga pisngi dahil sa luha. tumingin ako muli sa magkasintahan sa aking harapan at napangiti sa kanila. sana'y magtagal ang kanilang relasyon. hinatak ko na ang tali ng jeep at agad pumara ng makita ko na nandito na pala ako sa aking bababaan. sinuyod ko ng tingin ang pet shop at tumingin ulit sa aking cellphone upang tingnan ang message na kakatanggap ko lang. ""wait a bit. bumili lang ng ice cream"" napailing ako at napangiti ng malapad ng makita ang isang batang napakaganda sa di kalayuan. ""mom!"" sigaw ni ruine ng makita niya ako dahilan upang mapangiti ako. ""hi baby. how's your day?"" tanong ko at humalik ako sa kanyang pisngi at inayos ang kanyang tali sa buhok. ""super duper good, mom!"" may tumikhim sa'king likuran kaya lumingon ako rito ""ooohhh and tito alex bought me a rabbit"" napabagsak ang tingin ko sa cage na hawak ni alex at nakita ang isang kulay brown na rabbit. ""alex naman."" nakanguso kong tawag dito. he smirked at me at ginulo ang aking buhok. ""ron will be happy, mailene. gusto niya makitang masaya kayo ng anak mo."" sumikip ang dibdib ko sa kanyang sinabi. pinisil niya ang aking pisngi at inabot sakin ang cage upang mabuhat si ruine. alex is ron's bestfriend. siya ang naging father figure ni ruine. siya ang kasama ko noong nanganak ako, siya ang kasama ko ng unang beses magsalita ang anak ko ng ""mama"", siya ang kasama ko noong sinugod ko sa hospital si ruine ng lagnatin ito. si alex ang nagbantay sa amin ni ruine. kahit kailan ay hindi siya umalis sa tabi ko. itinaas ko ang cage na aking hawak at kinausap ang rabbit sa loob nito. ""katulad mo ako, nakakulong ka sa cage at nakakulong ako sa nakaraan."" napakagat labi ako ng marinig ko ang hagikgik ni ruine, napatingin ako sa likuran ni alex at buhat buhat niya ang aking anak. kitang kita ang saya ni ruine sa kanyang tito alex. humalik ito sa pisngi ng kanyang tito at ngumiti muli. sumunod na ako sa sasakyan ni alex, pinaupo niya ako sa passenger seat at inayos niya ang uupuan ni ruine sa likod katabi ang rabbit nito. sumakay na si alex at pinaandar ang sasakyan. nagulat ako ng kunin niya ang aking kamay kaya binawi ko ito sa kanya.

Excluded,"ang hirap din pala na lumaki sa pamilya na hinahayaan ka lang. nung elementary ako nag aaral lang talaga or ginugusto ko lang masama sa honor dahil gusto ng nanay ko yun. sinasabi lang ng nanay ko na okay lang daw kahit hindi pero yung totoo sobrang sumasama loob nya pag bumababa grades ko. samin kasing mag kakapatid ako lang yung honor student simula elementary. naaalala ko sumasali akong mga extra curricular kasi gusto ng nanay ko yun. basta gusto nya yung ginagawa ko di ko kailangan mag sabi. naalala ko nun gusto kong sumali sa music club kasi nag aaral silang tumugtog ng mga instruments di lang pag kanta. wala naman akong talent sa pag kanta kaya instruments lang gusto ko, bata palang ako gusto kong tumugtog. sabi ko pa nun pag nag 1st ako piano yung gift nila. sabi nila oo. college nako yung piano ko wala padin hahahaha. hinahayaan nila kong gawin yung mga gusto nilang ipagawa sakin pero yung gusto ko di ko magawa. everytime na may competition ako pag uwi ko galing school hindi nila ko pinagagawa ng gawaing bahay dun lang ako sa kwarto mag review lang daw ako. lagi yun, di nila alam pag nasa kwarto ako umiiyak lang ako madalas kasi sa school buong araw nag rereview lang ako pag uwi ganon ulit. sa isip isip ko di nyo bako iask if kamusta ko, okay ba ko. kamusta yung pag rereview ko. pinaka masakit pa tuwing may competition ako sasabihin ko lang yung araw kailan then bibigyan lang nila kong allowance yun na yun. wala bang ibang support akong makukuha. di nila ko sinasamahan yung mga kasama ko may parents, ako sagot ko lang may work po. laging teacher kasama ko tapos uuwi ako di nila ko tatanungin anong nangyari sa laban. no one knows if i win or not. then nagugulat sila pag nag congrats mga teacher ko sa kanila dahil nanalo ko sa competion. high school nag aral akong tumugtog ng guitar pero pinigilan din nila. paulit ulit lang pag top ako sa class wala akong maririnig sa kanila pag bumaba yung grades nagagalit sila. di nila nalalaman anong nangyayari sakin. gusto kong mag aral ng instrument at mag paint di ko magawa kasi di nila ko isusupport dun. wala akong masabihan nahihirapan na ko mag aral. wala akong masabihan na nagkaka anxiety and panic attack ako. wala silang alam sakin at hindi nila gustong alamin yun. hinahayaan lang nila ko na parang hangin. ang hirap pala, naiingit sakin mga kapatid ko kasi daw nagagawa ko daw yung gusto ko ha ha ha. samantalang sila need padaw nila mag paalam at magsabi kay nanay. sila nga tong may emotional support lagi. lagi silang kinakausap ni nanay para alamin anong nararamdaman nila. last year mag isa kong nakatira sa bahay namin. i celebrate my birthday on my own. no one checks me. i got sick, walang naka alam. buti pa yung mga tita, tito and pinsan ko sinisilip ako sa bahay at kinakamusta kasi takot na baka mapano ako wala akong kasama. pero mga kapatid nung nasa ibang bansa kasama yung tita ko at nag work sa ibang lugar every day kinakamusta. tapos pag may sakit sila tinatawagan ako ng parents ko para alagaan sila pero ako, ako pa yung bumibili ng gamot ko kahit nilalagnat na ko. tatawag yung parents ko sakin para kamustahin mga kapatid ko. pangalawa ako sa pinaka bata samin pero need ko alagaan yung 4 kong kapatid. never sa bahay ko na natanong nila ko kung kamusta ko. kahit iyun lang hindi ko natanggap. sa mata ng ibang tao ang perfect kong anak. may anak kang achiever at masunurin pero di nila alam na ginagawa ko lang yung kasi wala akong worth sa pamilya namin. parang throphy pinagmamalaki sa ibang tao pero hindi naman pinapansin pag di pinansin ng iba. yung tingin nila sakin independent kasi kayang ko gawin yung mga bagay ng walang tulong ng iba pero di nila alam feeling ko kasi left out ako and excluded ako sa family kaya ginagawa ko yun. wala akong kakampi, walang sumusuporta skain ako lang. sinong aasahan ko ako lang hindi. ang hirap.. napapa isip ko kasalan ko ba kaya rin ako nagkaganto?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/11yhgvx/excluded/,22 03 2023
"alex, tanghaling tapat ng sabado, 2021","(any review for this is very-very much appreciated. i'm an aspiring writer po and i just launched a passion project anthology, isa po ito sa mga kwento) &#x200b; **chairman** ngayon ko lang naranasan ‘to sa tagal ko nang nanunungkulan sa barangay. isama mo na sa mga karanasang ‘yon ang lahat ng away mag-asawa, suntukan ng mga lasing, at mga batang ginagahasa sa bukiran. pero eto… ngayon ko lang napansin na buong araw ko na palang hinihimas ang rosaryong nakasabit sa leeg ko. maya’t-maya ko pa hinahalikan at binubulungan na sana’y wag mangyari sa pamilya ko ang nakita ko kanina. naririnig ko pa rin ang sigaw ni cecil, kumare’t-kapitbahay namin, tanghaling tapat ng sabado, kung saan ang tanghalian sa buong kalsada nami’y naantala dahil sa kanyang nakakakilabot na sigaw. sa ilalim ng nagbabagang init ay nagsitakbuhan kami upang sumaklolo. kinailangan ko pang iwanan ang tinola ni misis at ang isang basong softdrinks na nilalanguyan pa dalawang yelo nang ako’y tumakbo papunta sa bahay ni cecil. ngayo’y hindi pa rin ako kumakain. sa totoo nga’y hindi pa ako nakakaranas ng gutom. hindi ko pa ata kaya. sa bahay ni cecil ay dinatnan namin ang katawan ng panganay ni cecil na si joe na nakaratay sa braso ng kanyang bunsong kapatid na si alex, sa sahig ng kanilang sala. sa leeg ni joe ay nakabaon ang basag na bote na ginamit ni alex na balot na balot sa dugo ng kanyang kapatid. agad ang kapit at halik ko sa aking rosaryo nang makita ko ang imahe; na parang sinaunang obra na naglalahad ng malagim na kwento. pero ano ang kwento neto? hanggang ngayon ay wala pa rin kaming ideya kung bakit. magmula sa pagsigaw ni cecil ng, “anong nangyari?! anak, anong nangyari?!” sa tulalang alex na nakatitig sa dilat na mga mata ni joe, hanggang sa pagpunta namin dito sa aking opisina sa barangay, ay wala pa rin kaming makuhang rason mula sa bakit. sa isang maliit na kwarto sa aking opisina’y pinaupo ko muna si alex. tulala at sinusubukang burahin ang dugo sa kanyang mukha gamit ang duguan ring damit n’ya. hinainan ko ng isang bote ng softdrinks at tatlong pandesal mula pa sa agahan namin kanina si alex, na agad namang n’yang kinain ng walang pag-aalinlangan. dito na nagsimulang gumapang ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod. isang kilabot na hindi ko maipaliwanag, habang pinapanood ko si alex na walang awat sa pagkain, habang ako’y hindi ko pa rin magawang matakam sa masarap na lutong nag-aabang sa’kin sa bahay. “alex,” marahan kong sinabi. “ba’t mo ginawa ‘yun?” tumingin lamang sa’kin si alex, patay na mga mata, bibig na mabagal ang nguya. at sa kanyang paglunok ay walang mga salitang bumalik sa’kin. hindi ko alam kung bakit pero bigla kong naalala si jefferson, isang tricycle driver dito sa’min. dalawang taon na ang nakakalipas nang mapatay n’ya ang isang dayo na nakaaway n’ya sa kalsada. nangyari ‘to nang kamuntikan n’yang makasalpukan ang sasakyan ng dayo, at nang nahinto silang dalawa’y nagkasagutan muna sila bago mapikon si jefferson. hinampas n’ya ng bakal na tubo ang dayo. hindi na raw n’ya napigilan dahil sa mga mapanglait na mga salitang tinawag sa kanya. bobo, unggoy, uling, mababa. labing-isang beses paulit-ulit na hinampas ni jefferson sa ulo ang dayo, at sa sobrang lakas ng bawat hampas ay may parte na ng utak na lumabas dito. sa prisinto’y naalala ko si jefferson, iyak nang iyak at humihingi ng tawad dahil sa nangyari. hindi makakain, hindi rin makatulog. nilamon na s’ya ng konsensya n’ya, at ang konsensya n’ya ang tumulak sa kanya na agawin ang baril ng isa sa mga pulis na nagbabantay, at iputok sa kanyang sariling ulo. nasaktan si jefferson, nagalit, at di nakapagpigil. naintindihan ko ang kwento ‘nun. pero bakit hindi ko maintindihan ‘to? alam kong magkasundo ang magkapatid na ‘to. alam ko kung ga’no sila kalapit sa isa’t-isa. kaya pa’no nangyari ‘to? ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod ay gumagapang paakyat hanggang sa aking dibdib, tila ba kumakapit ng mahigpit. pasikip nang pasikip at medyo nahihirapan akong huminga. ang kakaibang pakiramdam na ‘to’y tumitindi habang nanatiling tahimik at nakatitig lamang sa’kin si alex. biglang iniabot ni alex ang kanyang kamay at dito tumalon na ang puso ko. napaatras ako sa aking kinauupuan, at mabilisan kong hinugot ang aking rosaryo mula sa pagkakatago nito sa aking damit. itinutok ko ito kay alex, na walang ibang kibo kun’di ang kunin ang bote ng softdrinks na nasa harapan n’ya. mas bumilis pa ang pagkatok sa aking dibdib, na para bang kamuntikan na kong mamatay. habang si alex nama’y pinapanood lang ako habang patuloy ang kanyang pag-inom. wala nga ata talagang mangyayari, at nang maramdaman ko kung gaano katahimik ang kwarto’y kumalma na ako. bakit sa dulo ng utak ko’y hinihiling ko na may sapi o di kaya’y isang demonyo talaga ang kaharap ko, at sa presensya ng aking rosaryo’y masasaktan s’ya. kahit anong kakaiba. kahit ano basta magkaroon lang ng eksplenasyon ang nangyari. pero siguro’y kakaiba na rin ang ikinikilos ng bata. at siguro nga’y mas dapat talaga akong matakot sa buhay kaysa sa patay. **cecil** “saan ba ko nagkulang?” tanong ni aling cecil sa mga kumare n’yang nakapalibot sa kanya sa masikip na opisina ni chairmain. napapaligiran din s’ya ng makukulay na mga pamaypay na hindi sabay-sabay ang pagaspas sa harap n’ya; nilulunod si aling cecil sa hangin. ang kanyang mukha nama’y tila ba isang rebulto ng santo kung punas-punasan ng mga panyo. “hindi ko pa rin maintindihan,” dugtong n’ya. “hindi naman ako nagkulang sa aruga. pareho ko namang pinapakita sa kanila na pantay ang pagmamahal ko sa kanila.” tuyo na ang mga mata ni aling cecil, ngunit tila ba hindi pa rin tapos ang kanyang pag-iyak. “hindi sila nag-aaway. hindi ko man lang narinig na nagtalo silang dalawa. o kung may pagtatalo man, malamang sa malamang maliit na bagay lang ‘yun. hindi yung ikakamatay mo!” isang labi ng lumapit sa tenga ni aling cecil, “alam mo tingin ko, baka inggit ‘yan. kasi si joe lang may trabaho sa kanilang dalawa, di ba? tapos si alex, wala pa rin sa kolehiyo. nag-aaral pa rin. sigurado akong ‘yun ang dahilan.” isa pang labi ang lumapit sa kabilang tenga naman ni aling cecil, “baka napikon na. kasi di ba halos s’ya na sa lahat ng gawaing bahay? baka pakiramdam n’ya porke’t mas malaki ambag ng kapatid n’ya , alila na s’ya neto.” isang labi naman na kaharap ni aling cecil ang nagsabing, “baka nagbabait-baitan lang kasi nga si joe ang halos sumasalo sa mga bayarin, pati sa pag-aaral n’ya. pero galit talaga s’ya, kasi baka naman may pagkakataong mas nabibigyang-atensyon si joe kahit hindi n’yo napapansin. kasi halimbawa uuwi s’yang pagod galing sa trabaho, syempre di n’yo maiwasang alagaan, pagsilbihan.” sa gitna ng mga labing ito’y si aling cecil, at ang ideyang unti-unting nabubuo dahil sa mga sinasabi ng mga labi sa kanya. “siguro,” sabi n’ya. “siguro nga.” **abbie** ang pangalan n’ya’y abbie. social worker daw s’ya. pagpasok n’ya’y agad bumungad sa’kin ang asul na bra sa ilalim ng dilaw na blouse nang tapatan ito ng liwanag mula sa bintanang katabi ko. sa kanyang pagtali ng buhok ay nakita kong basang-basa na ang kanyang kili-kili at kumikinang na sa pawis ang kanyang leeg. “alex?” sabi n’ya habang maya’t-mayang tinutulak ng kanyang daliri ang salamin n’yang dumudulas sa kanyang matangos na ilong. “bakit di mo ikwento muna sa’kin ang nangyari bago tayo umalis dito?” pasensya ka na, abbie. hindi ko nagawang sabihin kay chairman, na kilala pa mandin namin. hinding-hindi ko rin masasabi sa’yo. walang ibang maglalahad ng nangyari kun’di ang mga taong nais magbigay kahulugan dito, kasi kung ako tatanungin kung bakit, sa totoo lang, hindi ko rin alam ang isasagot. may nabasag akong bote sa kusina kanina, at sa pagpulot ko nito’y pumasok sa isip ko ang isang udyok. yung tipo ng udyok kapag nasa mataas kang lugar, at bigla mo na lang gustong itulak ang kasama mo. pero alam mong hindi ito dapat gawin, at kakapit ka pa nang mas mahigpit sa kanila para masiguro mong hindi ito mangyayari. ang udyok na ito’y nagsabi sa’kin na isaksak ko kay kuya ang basag na bote. at nalaman ko na lang na totoo na pala ang lahat nang dumapo sa aking balat ang mainit na dugo ni kuya. nahinto lang ako nang maramdaman ko ang buto sa leeg n’ya at nang marinig kong nabibilaukan na s’ya sa kanyang sariling dugo. hindi ko pa rin alam kung bakit. sana, tulad ng iniisip ni chairman, ay nasapian na nga lang ako. pero nakita ko ang lahat, andun ako. hindi ko lang alam na totoo pala ang lahat. namatay si kuya joe sa wala. at hindi ko matanggap na wala. normal lang sana ang sabado namin. tahimik. nanonood lang si kuya ng tv, naglilinis ako sa kusina. si nanay nama’y namamalengke ng pananghalian namin. bicol express daw ang lulutuin n’ya. puta, sinira ko ang araw. gusto kong umiyak dahil hindi na kami babalik sa salo-salo namin. “alex?” muling tawag ni abbie. “gusto kong malaman kung bakit. tayong dalawa lang. kaibigan mo ko dito. hinding-hindi ko ‘to sasabihin sa nanay mo, sa mga kapitbahay n’yo. may mga naririnig ako sa labas na dahil daw sa inggit? totoo ba ‘to? sa inggit nga? magmula nang dinala ako ni chairman dito sa maliit na kwartong ito’y napagpasyahan kong manahimik na lang sa nangyari. sa ngayo’y nilalabanan ko ang mga luha, nilalabanan ko ang panginginig ng aking bibig, at ang mga salitang gustong lumabas mula sa’kin. dapat mukhang hindi ko pinagsisisihan. dapat mukha akong galit. para naman mabigyang halaga, mabigyan ng ibig-sabihin ang pagkamatay ni kuya joe. dapat tinatatak ko sa utak ko na dapat lang! dapat lang sa kanya ang nangyari. dapat hindi ako bibigay. dahil kapag natalo ako, mamatay talaga sa wala si kuya. “sige, kung ayaw mong magkwento, ako muna. kasi naalala ko ‘tong isang batang babae at ang tatay n’yang abusado. tatay n’yang lasinggero. tatay n’yang isang beses s’yang hinipuan sa kanyang sariling kwarto at pinilit. ampon ang batang ‘yon, at tatay-tatayan n’ya lang etong umaabuso sa kanya. takot na takot ang bata dahil pakiramdam n’ya isang gabi’y papatayin na lang s’ya bigla neto. kaya naman isang gabi, nang bigla s’yang pinuntahan ng kanyang tatay upang pagsamantalahan ulit, sinasaksak ito ng bata gamit ang lapis sa mata, sa leeg, at sa dibdib.” kumuha ng panyo si abbie. sa kanyang paggalaw ay muling sumisilip ang kanyang bra sa likod ng blouse na parang mga batang naglalaro sa likod ng kurtina. “masarap sa pakiramdam, pero pumapatay pa rin s’ya ng tao. ilan taon n’yang dinibdib ‘yun. hanggang ngayon nararamdaman pa rin n’ya ang mga kamay ng tatay n’ya sa kanyang ari. sa kanyang dibdib. ilang taon bago n’ya matanggap ang ginawa n’ya. ngayon, medyo mahirap pa ring ikwento, pero kahit papaano’y kaya ko na. nangyari na kasi.” para bang may sumuntok sa aking dibdib nang marinig ko ‘to. bigla kong tinanggal ang aking paningin sa kanyang bra, at sa paggalaw ng aking mga mata’y bigla kong naramdaman ang pamumuo ng mga luha. “ayos lang, alex. pero andito lang ako. aalagaan ka muna namin. tapos pag handa ka na, makikinig ako. kahit pakonte-konte pa, ayos lang. aantayin kong mabuo ang kwento mo.” bumibilis bigla ang tibok ng puso ko. lalong nanginginig ang aking labi. at biglang pumasok si kuya sa isip ko, tumatakbo papalayo sa akin. mga bata pa kami, at hinahabol ko s’ya. “alex?” kuya wag kang lumayo! “alex?” kuya dito ka lang! kailangan kita dito! “sige, ayusin na natin pag-alis mo.” at parang isang batang nadapa sa semento, dito na walang awat na tumulo ang luha sa aking mga mata. “alex?” “hindi ko rin alam… hindi… ko rin alam. sorry, kuya! sorry! hindi ko rin alam kung bakit! patayin n’yo na lang ako! hindi ko alam anong nangyari! hindi ko na kaya!” lumalabo na ang aking paningin, pero kahit ga’no kalabo ang aking mga mata’y kitang-kita ko ang gulat at takot sa mukha ni abbie. pasensya ka na, kuya.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/nlygsa/alex_tanghaling_tapat_ng_sabado_2021/,27 05 2021

Legal ba ang pet euthanasia dito? (Isabela province),"na parvo yung 2-month-old puppy ko. noong una palang na nagpakita siya ng signs ng pananamlay at pagsusuka, dinala na namin agad sa vet. once naconfirm na positive siya sa parvo naconfine naman siya agad pero mabilis na nagdeteriorate yung health niya. nung andun na siya sa clinic, nagi-start na syang magpoops ng dugo. tinanong ko na agad yung vet niya kung anong pwedeng maging option in case mag worsen yung kalagayan niya. kasi tinitignan ko yung liit nyan yun, iniimagine ko palang yung pagdadaanan niya sobrang naiiyak na ako. ngayon inaaffirm nila ako na kakayanin niya naman, kaya nagka hope naman ako na magiimprove yung kalagayan niya. basta i-observe lang daw. hindi naman sa pagiging pessimistic, pero gusto ko lang ding marinig yung isang possibility kahit sobrang sakit niyang isipin. gustong gusto ko syang gumaling i swear. pero kung ang ibig sabihin non e ioobserve siya ng ilang days para tignan kung magworkout yung gamutan niya. titignan kung maka survive siya o hindi. and in case man na makasurvive siya, hindi pa guaranteed na magkakaroon siya ng normal life after parvo. triny kong i brought up ko yung euthanasia, kung legal ba, kung pwede bang maging option. pero parang iniiwasan nilang sagutin. never nila akong binigyan ng exact na sagot. basta i-observe lang at kasi baka naman makasurvive siya. ngayon inoobserve namin si puppy. nakaswero parin siya at nagagamot pero parang hindi siya nagwowork. inoobserve nalang namin kung paano siya mag suffer ng unti-unti na syang nanghihina. constant na yung pagsusuka, pagtatae ng dugo, pag ihi niya. sobrang awang-awa na ako sa kanya. parang inaantay nalang namin na kusa siyang malagutan ng hininga. sobrang traumatizing at heartbreaking. i feel so helpless. gustong-gusto kong i-ease na yung nararamdaman niya kaso 'di ko naman alam kung papaano.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/16jghgd/legal_ba_ang_pet_euthanasia_dito_isabela_province/,15 09 2023
Story time: Uninformed News Edition,"a friend showed me a tiktok video of a supposed influencer sharing his thoughts on covid. the video (with embedded texts) went like this: ""storytime: covid 19 edition and then dinala sa hospital, dead on arrival. then sabi nung doctor sa mga kamag anak. kung papayag yung family na ang ilagay sa death cert nung namatay ay covid instead of heart attack 😱😱. so yun lang, idk what to do with that information kaya skl."" let me answer you, what you should do with that information is ask someone who is knowledgeable on the topic or at least someone who knows more than you do, cause you definitely don't know a lot. what you should not do though is post a video putting the hospital and medical professionals in a malicious light. for those of you who wants to be educated on the topic: anyone who is symptomatic, we can't mix with those who do not have the symptoms. ubo, sipon, lagnat, hirap sa paghinga, pananakit ng kasukasuan, pagsusuka, pagtatae or pagkawala ng pang-amoy at panlasa. you might be wondering, eh ang daming sakit with the same symptoms. yes, kaya nga po puno ang emergency rooms and covid floors. unless proven na negative ka sa covid (with rt-pcr), it is prudent that we don't place you with those without the symptoms. hospital protocols also dictates that anyone who arrives dead will be tagged as covid suspect (relating to the tiktok vid, paano nasabing heart attack? may ckmb ka? may trop i ka? may ecg ka ba???). covid also complicates underlying conditions like heart, brain problems which might have led to the demise of the patient. did the patient die of a heart problem? possible. did the patient die of covid? possible. hindi sya exclusive, and unless we do post-mortem swab, we will not know. the government ideally should fund more research centers and laboratories, to make testing more available kahit sa maralita. sayang yung mga inutang. hindi lahat ng tao afford ang 2-5k na rt-pcr swab na may 7 days validity lang. pag may rt-pcr ka na timely ang collection, you need not be tagged as suspect and can be treated sa covid negative area, therefore decongesting the covid suspect area, therefore freeing some resources that can be used for those in critical conditions. i am all for freedom of expression, but i also believe in responsible posting. supposed ~influencers~ should help us eradicate misinformation, use their platform for greater good. you also address your audience well. isang taon na tayong lockdown, ang dami nang dinagdag na letra sa cq. baka naman po? if you have any questions, if in any way i can explain things in simpler terms. i also urge people in the medical field to answer people the simplest way possible, to be ""patola"" na. our job extends way outside the corners of the hospital. di na lang covid ang kalaban, bad governance, ignorance and misinformation too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/mgihgq/story_time_uninformed_news_edition/,30 03 2021

Di ko alam paano mag “move-on”,"sorry at mejo late na pero di talaga ako makapag move-on. di ko kasi maintindihan. nalulungkot ako. i can’t make sense of whats happening. my parents met in college noong ‘83, aktibista sila. and growing up, palagi nilang kinukwento paano sila noon, yung mga kaibigan nila na bigla nalang nawala, mga na detain, etc. mahirap daw talaga ang buhay noong bata sila kaya sabi ng tatay ko, nagsumikap sila to give us a better future. kahit na may pagkakataon noon na umalis sa pinas, ayaw ng tatay ko. mahal nya ang pilipinas at sabi nya doon lang daw siya. during campaign period, nag h2h sila. pero sabi ng tatay ko, “we are trying our best but just prepare yourself because it looks like we’re outnumbered” kasi ang dami nya daw talaga nakakausap na lbm fanatics talaga. nung nanalo na, sobrang lungkot namin. isang linggo ako umiiyak (even now kapag naririnig ko yung rosas, lol) then i asked my dad at sabi nya lang “tayo nalang muna isipin natin”. pero ang bigat pa rin sa pakiramdam besh. paano ba ako magmomove on? ofw ako ngayon at plano ko na talaga umuwi this year. but i’m scared of the future in the philippines. alam mo yung ayaw ko na isipin at gusto ko sana bigyan ng chance ang bagong administration pero bigla akong may makikitang comment or statement or whatever from them na nakakapang-init ng ulo. naiinis ako. pero i feel helpless and its not good for my mental health na ito nalang pagali ko iniisip. i get headaches na kasi i can’t find a way how to move past this. paano ba?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/v3d9f5/di_ko_alam_paano_mag_moveon/,2 06 2022
"After two years, I visited EDSA and Makati again.","hi i am a probinsyano from central luzon 👋. i was based in mm before covid happened and never came back after. at ngayon na free na, i decided to travel again to visit dahil namiss ko (hehe) at to prepare if pababalikin na kami sa office. as i always practically take the buses, here is my commuting experience: 1. nabago na pala bus routes ng mga galing north provinces. hindi na pumapasok sa may cloverleaf to edsa, pero sa same station pa din naman ang babaan. sa mga baranggay na siya dumadaan. 2. may designated na babaan na sa edsa, barricaded, and most is sa tabi ng mrt stations. i found it organized pero grabe ang layo pala ng lakaran dagdag pagod pag sumabay sa init. kawawa ka pala kapag wala kang kotse sa edsa ngayon at hindi malapit sa station ang pupuntahan mo.for example sa boni, wala ng babaan so either ortigas or guada kana bababa. then lakad ka. 3. some roads were re-routed for example papasok ng makati, instead of 1 aircon bus to buendia lrt, you need to take 2 jeepneys na. hassle at pagod, lalo na sa mga papasok sa work. pero ang kagandahan one way na siya. dati kasi traffic doon lagi pag rush hour. 4. lastly pauwi sa province, sa edsa carousel, instead sa may footbridge, sa may q mart na ang babaan. grabe ang layo pala hahaha. di ko sure if magkadistansya sila ng mrt to provincial bus stations (victory, genesis, five star etc.). in conclusion, ang hirap pala bumyahe as a probinsyano ngayon na walang kotse. kung ako nahirapan, naisip ko lang what more sa mga araw araw na nagttrabaho na sa public transpo umaasa at senior citizens na naglalakad lng. ang tataas pa ng footbridge ng iba. though i am not sure if this has more advantages para ma ease ang traffic, pero in my opinion, siguro may other options pa to meet in the middle. iconsider ang mga normal na mamamayan at maimprove pa ang quality ng buhay sa maynila. feel free to correct me baka may schedules pala or mas convenient na paraan bumyahe po ngayon. friday to sunday kasi ako bumyahe. thank you for reading! 😊",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/t8fkp0/after_two_years_i_visited_edsa_and_makati_again/,7 03 2022

On-Going Troll Post Being Shared Around Social Media,"so, a relative shared this to me today. i'm pretty sure it's a troll post meant to spread panic and disruption for whatever reason, but do please stay aware (and intelligent) of posts like these! unfortunately, someone out there is going to believe this (someone not american). ================================================================================ a l e r t !! !! !! please read now !! !! !! attention everyone!!! \[must read!\] step 1: wag kayong papayag na mag swabtest kasi magiging positive kayo sa covid at madadamay lahat ng taong lumapit sa inyo. step 2: wag na wag niyong papabayaan ang mga anak niyo lalo na ang mga bata. step 3: read carefully kasi 500 million na tao ang target sa pandemic na ito. step 4: if masama ang pakiramdam mo or nilalagnat ka, best na gawin ay mag init ng tubig or magsuob ka gamit ang kumot para dun lumabas init mo. very important notice: sinusuhulan na ngayon ang mga companies at sa media para maisagawa na ang pang kalahata!ng bakuna. may dalawang component itong future vaccine na hnd pa tinutukoy, secret pa. pero ang pangatlo ay ang "" squalene "". covid = certificate of vaccination identity 1= a for artificial 9= i for intelligence hindi pala ito pangalan ng virus, kung hindi ito'y international plan para makontrol at hindi dumami ang population. nadevelop na ito more than 10 years ago. nailunsad na ito last january 2020 during the last davos. dont get tracked (wag tau sumunod) pagkatapos ng 70 days, ang virus na ito ay hindi na active, kaya nalalampasan natin ito. kaya naman nagreactivate ang virus na ito, kasi humina ang immune natin sa bakuna. ang plano talaga nila i inject sa atin (7 more terrible vaccines) totoong itutulak tayo papuntang impierno. ang target nila, madaming mababawas na tao, mahigit 80% ang mapapasama. ito namang 5g na na install sa mga cities sa buong mundo ay para pahinain ang ating immune system. kaya wag talaga magpa test dahil hindi ito makabubuti. ang mga manufacturer ng tester na ito ay nag sasabi na hindi madetect ang sras\_cov\_2 virus na ito. kung hindi ang walang katapusan na maliliit na virus o wastes cell lamang na nasa microbiata natin, kaya ang result na lumalabas, madami ang positibo pero hnd nila matukoy ang covid virus mismo. kaya ito ang objective nila: una ilabas ang mga bata, kasi hindi nila ma impose ang test sa mga matatanda. sa kabila nito, last may 11 sa france, nag conduct ng mass screening sa lahat ng schools (700k/per week). kaya naman bawat school director ay may pahintulot galing sa rectorate para sa ganun maimpose ang test sa mga bata kahit walang pahintulot sa magulang o wala manlang pasabi. once na ang bata ay nascreen na, saka lang tatawagin ang immediate family para mag pa screen din. obligado ka tanggapin ang screening. kasi kung ayaw mo, ang anak mo ay aalisin sa naturang school. yan ang mangyayari at itoy ay order ng school. tayong walang sakit ay healthy carriers o carriers lang tayo sa little viruses lamang, yan ang laging lumalabas sa mga test....as positive. lahat sila kailangan ganito: paniwalain na ang buong mundo ay may sakit. "" make the whole world believe that the world is sick"". kapag naging positive ka sa test ay matutukoy na isa kang panganib, tulad ng mga hudyo. ang pagtanggi sa screening ay siyang susi para mas maiwasan natin ang pag tatalaga ng bakuna sa atin (wave 2), kapag hindi tumaas ang bilang, ay mas hindi sila papayagan na italaga ang bakuna sa 7 bilyon katao.... sa oras na nabakunahan, lahat tayo ay magkakasakit at manghihina.....at alam nyo na ang kasunod... sa france, ang mga tao doon ay tumatanggi sa screening. ang mensahe ay naiintindihan ng mga mamamayan doon. hindi nila pababalikin ang mga bata sa school. ayaw nila na may mass screening at hindi sila pumapayag sa second wave vaccination. ang mahalagang solution, iligtas ang sangkatauhan. make people understand that they should not allow themselves to be tested. 1. huwag ka magpapahuli 2. huwag ka magpapa test 3. huwag ka mag papabakuna we must fill the walls of facebook, videos, all media spaces with this message. more clear panels! their point of attacks: our children. their strategy: \_ a screening \_ do not give what they lack \_ at least you cannot say that you have not been warned ipakalat ito sa lahat sa lalong madaling panahon kasi ang prosesong ito ay parating na. \[kung alam niyo man kung ano ang illuminati maiintindihan niyo po ng mas maayos. kumikilos na sila at unti unti ng nangyayari ang nakasulat sa bibliya. keep safe every one! god bless y'all. don't forget to pray t hingin ang guidance ni lord.\] ps: sinasagawa na po ang hakbang na ito sa ibang bansa pero hindi sila nagtagumpay kasi hindi pumayag ang mga taong magpaturok. \[share this to everyone!\]",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/htdgbx/ongoing_troll_post_being_shared_around_social/,18 07 2020

"as a student, I don't feel safe in today's economy","i'm studying my last year in high school (grade 12) and i can't help but feel paranoid about everything that's going on with our economy nowadays. i would say i am performing well in my academics. but nakakasakit talaga isipin na everything is not going to be ok in the future. i have my ambitions in life. gusto ko talaga mas maging part ng forbes list hehe. lately, my family's financial situation has been getting worse and worse (i live with my mom and my infant half-brother). and it's been taking a toll on me talaga. our house is too chaotic for me to study in. di talaga ako maka-focus pag gusto ni bunso ng attention or mom interrupts me with errands. like bruh i have to wait for them to settle down before i can do anything. last week, i went home from school. i was looking forward to plan my day kasi gusto ko pa na man sana mag-schedule ng pahinga at workout before going back to studying. but when i got home, there was no electricity; naputulan na pala kami ng kuryente. i had to sleep alone that night at ang init pa ng kwarto. ever since the start of f2f classes, yung allowance ko kasya lng talaga pang public transportation. i can't save any for the holidays or the future kapag may plano yung mga tropa ko. nag-move na ako to public school dahil alam ko na di na kaya ni mama matustusan yung tuition ko for senior high school. di ko alam na may gastos pa pala sa research dahil di sponsored ng skwelahan namin yung expenses. guess who's getting screwed again? alam ko po na some of you guys have it worse than me, and you might think i'm such a whiny baby for posting this. pero i'm not here to rant about how bad my life is. my point is that i want to achieve my aspirations in life, pero nakaka-demotivate yung mga nangyayari ngayon sa buhay ko. i'm sure may gusto din kayo marating sa buhay nyo pero may mga hadlang talaga katulad nito that makes you just wanna quit. di pa na man ako nakakaabot sa point na gusto ko sumuko sa ambition ko. i hope i don't reach that point. i know na kailangan ko din dumiskarte kung gusto ko maging successful. pero yan yung weakness ko eh. i lack the streetsmarts talaga. still, i'm not gonna mope around and feel sorry for myself. if you have some piece of wisdom you can give to this young soul, i'd really appreciate it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/xaol8g/as_a_student_i_dont_feel_safe_in_todays_economy/,10 09 2022
Commuter Story,"*hango sa totoong pangyayari* late ang company bus, ngawit na ang paa ko matapos ang mahigit isang oras na nakatayo. pawis na pawis na ang nguso dahil sa init ng surgical mask. sa paanan ay walong kilong groceries sa loob ng eco bags. ""hay salamat,"" sabi ko noong nakita ko na ang pinakahihintay kong ""blue line."" tulad ng nakagawian, matapos ang pagsukat ng temperatura ay pinapasok na ako. so pagod, gutom at kalamigan ng aircon ako ay natutulog habang nakasilip sa bintana. trenta minutos lang ay makakauwi na ako. napakalas ng ulan, mahirap makita ang mga dinadaanan. napansin ko na hindi pamilyar ang mga nakikita kong gusali. baka nagbago ng daan ang driver dahil sa baha. nais ko siyang tanungin ngunit ako ay malayo at siya ay nakakulong sa plastik na booth. naghintay-hintay pa ako at nakinig sa balita sa telebisyon tungkol sa quarantine. aabot na sa 15,000 ang may covid-19. mga tricycle ay limitado at hindi pinapayagan sa ibang lugar. nagugutom na ang mga pamilyang nawalan ng trabaho. gusto ko sanang mag *mobile legends* ngunit may kutob akong hindi dapat ako mag laro. hindi pa rin pamilyar ang mga nakikita kong bilihan at mga kainan mula sa bintana ng aking bus. paunti-unti bumababa na ang ilang pasahero at iilan na lang ang natitira. ilang minuto ako nagmasid mula sa bintana at sa kadiliman ng gabi't kasagsagan ng ulan bumati ang: *welcome to the province of rizal.* pauwi dapat ako sa marikina. hindi ko napigilang mapa-potangina. lumapit ako sa driver at nagtanong. doon ko nalaman nagpalit pala ng daan ang mga sasakyan ng kompanya ko at hindi ako nasabihan. may walong kilo ako ng grocery, malakas ang ulan, madilim, at walang ibang masakyan para ako'y makauwi. baha ang mga daanan ng aking ama at hindi kaya ng aming kotse lumusong. ""kuya, paano po kaya gagawin ko?"" sabi ko sa driver, awang awa sa aking sarili. tawag na ng tawag ang nanay ko at nagtatanong kung nasaan na ako. marami na akong nabuong plano kung paano umuwi, kasama na ang pag-arkila ng tricycle mula simbahan ng antipolo pa punta marikina. papayag kaya sila p500? ngunit sabi ni kuya driver, ""sige na nga hatid kita malapit sa inyo."" imbis na nagpahinga ay nagmaneho pa siya ng karagdagang trenta minutos para sa akin. isang malaking ginhawa at labis ang pasasalamat ko kay kuya. nalaman kong sa davao pala talaga siya nakatira ngunit sampung taon na siya sa maynila upang mag-hanap buhay. ang tagal na niya daw hindi nakauwi. ang nagawa ko lang sa kanya ay magbahagi ng iilang grocery ko, bilang tulong at kaunting ginhawa. sa kalagitnaan ng nangyayari sa atin, ang kabutihan na ginawa niya ay napakaganda. hindi ko ito malilimutan habang ako ay nabubuhay. /kwento",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/grkyfh/commuter_story/,27 05 2020

""tang... tinakot mo naman ako boss."" - sabi ko. tinignan n'ya ako na parang wala lang at bumalik sa ginagawa nito. ""akala ko umuwi na ang lahat. ako nga pala si michael, bagong gwardiya."" - sabi ko, gaya ng nauna, hindi n'ya ako pinansin. kumaway na ako at umalis pabalik ng office. babasahin ko na sana ulit ang mga rules ng biglang may matinis na tunog akong narinig na para bang may bakal na kumi-kiskis sa isa pang bakal na nag-eecho sa buong building. medyo mahina na ito at parang nang-gagaling sa mga tubo. tumagal din iyon ng ilang segundo at huminto sa kaparehas na segundo. hindi ko na lang pinansin at i-idlip na lang, check ng cell phone. pero medyo tumatagal na ang tunog at habang mas kinikilabutan ako ay unti-unti nang nagbabago ang kanina'y parang bakal na kumi-kiskis sa isa't-isa ay naging... ungol. lumabas ako ng office at tatanungin ko sana 'yung kaninang naka lab coat pero mukhang naka-uwi na s'ya sa mga oras na 'yun. hindi ako sigurado kung saan mismo nang-gagaling ang tunog, pero parang sa may crypt, kaya naman pinuntahan ko ito. 'yung oras na binuksan ko ang pinto ay ang buong building ay nanahimik. huminga ako ng malalim at napansin ko na 'yung isang chambers ay naka-bukas na ng bahagya. tinulak ko ito pabalik at agad-agad na bumalik sa office. nawala na ng tuluyan ang matinis na na para bang ungol na iyon. nagpatuloy ako sa pagbabasa: 3. maari kang matulog sa office, pero dapat handa ka sa mga mangyayari. sleep at your own risk, ika nga nila. matapos nun ay isang napaka-lakas na tunog ang halos mag-patalon sa buong pagkatao ko. ""tulong! palabasin n'yo ako dito!"" - ang boses ay tila nang-gagaling sa mga tubo. tumayo ako habang sobra ang kalabog ng dibdib ko. ""palabasin n'yo ako, hindi ako maka-hinga!"" - paulit-ulit na pagmama-kaawa ng boses na ngayon ay may kasama ng kalabog. binuksan ko ang pintuan ng office at sa hindi malaman na dahilan sa crypt nang-gagaling ang boses. nanginginig, pero binuksan ko ang pinto. ""buhay pa ako, isa itong pagkakamali! tulong!"" - mas lalong lumakas ang boses nung oras na buksan ko ang napaka-bigat at solidong pinto. ""asan ka?!"" - nanginginig akong tumingin sa paligid, habang ang walang humpay na tumatawag ang boses na may kasamang malalakas na kalabog. lumapit ako at unti-unting inilapit ang tenga para maka-siguro na ang bubuksan ko ay ang tamang chamber. ""buhay pa ako! utang na loob! ple----"" ang boses at ang mga kalabog ay daglian na lamang nawala nang biglaan kong binuksan ang isa sa mga chambers at sinalubong ako ng malamig na bangkay ng isang middle-aged na lalaki. tumayo lang ako doon, nakatitig sa bangkay, halos tumigil sa pagtakbo ang isip ko sa kung ano ang mga nangyayari. malinaw na malinaw kong narinig at naramdaman ko ang bawat kalabog nung oras na hinawakan ko ang hawakan ng chamber at para bang may kung sino man na bigla-bigla na lang nagpatigil nito. pinaglalaruan lang ba ako ng aking isipan? tinulak ko ang chamber pabalik at mabilis na umalis doon, nilock ang pinto ng office. iniisip ko na ang pag-aaply sa trabahong 'to ay maaring isang malaking pagkakamali. pakiramdam ko na nababaliw na ako, pero agad ko ring kinumbinse ang sarili ko na nasa ulo ko lang lahat ng 'to. nagpatuloy ako sa pagbabasa ng mg rules: 4. puwede kang mag-patugtog para maibsan ang katahimikan basta't hindi ito makaka-kuha ng atensyon sa labas. 5. kung may marinig kang hindi mo maipaliwanag na ingay galing sa may crypt, 'wag mo na lamang ito pansinin. 6. kung ang mga ingay na 'yun ay naging sigaw ng pagpapanic, gawin ang mga sumusunod: • kung ang mga sigaw ay mula sa babae, 'wag mo pansinin hanggang sa tumigil ito. 'wag na 'wag kang papasok sa loob ng crypt sa mga oras na nangyayari ito sa kahit anong dahilan. • kung ang mga ingay ay mula sa lalaki, hanapin ang pinag-mumulan ng ingay at hatakin ang chamber. dapat huminto na ang ingay pagkatapos mong mabuksan ang chamber. doon na nagtatapos ang page. nilapag ko na ang papel at dahan-dahang inilapat ang likod ko sa upuan. ala una na noon at nag-sisimula na akong antukin. maya-maya pa ay nagsisimula ng pumikit ang aking mga mata ng kusa. nagsisimula na akong mahulog sa panaginip nang biglang may mahigpit akong hawak na naramdaman sa likod ng aking balikat. sa sobrang gulat ko ay agad-agad akong napatayo at sinipa ang upuan. walang tao o kahit ano noong mga oras na iyon. hindi na ako inaantok nung mga oras na 'yun. tahimik na ang buong kapaligiran noon at nagpunta ako sa palikuran. pagbalik ko ay alas tres na at halos handa na akong tapusin ang shift ko dito. napagisip-isip ko na hindi na rin masama para sa isang libo, hanggang tinalikod ko ang papel na may mga rules at napansin kong may naka-sulat pa sa likod: 7. lahat ng staff ay lalabas o dapat nasa labas na ng building bago mag alas diyes ng gabi, kaya kung may makita kang lalaki na naka lab coat during your shift, 'wag na 'wag sa kahit ano mang sitwasyon na subukan mong makipag-usap sa kanya. paulit-ulit-ulit kong binasa ang rule ng limang beses, pero wala pa ring nagbabago sa naka-sulat. may mahinang katok sa pinto ng office. tinignan ko ito at sa likod ng salamin ay nakita ko ang lalaking naka lab coat naka-ngiti sa akin. alas kwatro 'y media na at patuloy pa rin s'ya sa pagkatok. sa mga magta-tanong, hindi ko na ho alam kung saan ko ito nakuha dahil 2018 ko pa po ito tinagalog. nakita ko lang na naka-save pa rin sa note ng selpon ko. salamat and ang init. tangina.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/t8j464/tagalized_morgue/,7 03 2022
[Story time] Things I Notice As a First Time Driver,"magpapalit na ako ng work thanks to the ccp virus at mapapadpad ako sa makati. hindi ko naman need pumunta doon lagi, pero for moments that need to, mahirap na mag rely sa public transpo at mahirap na din makipagsapalaran sa grab during rush hours. so i made time to learn how to drive. may kotse naman kami at motor. since i know naman mag motor, learning how to drive a car is next. so off to lto to get a student permit. * first annoyance, kupal yung guard na nakapusap ko. pinapabalik ako bukas kasi may quota na daw sila. not exactly sure why, since hindi naman ako mag-eexam doon. just got my medical and came back tomorrow. need daw as early as 4am (wtf!!!) na nakapila. surely, gawin nila parang dfa yung appointment nila, ndi na need mangyari eto. * anyway, went early around 7 am. nakuha ko naman permit shy of lunch. kupal yung guard, for exaggerating. now that's out of the way. puwede na ako mag-drive with supervision. best option ko is via driving school since designed sila for teaching people how to drive. i applied for a manual lesson kahit automatic ang kotse namin, so that i can drive both kinds of cars. fortunately, mabait yung nagturo sa akin at yung last 2 days ay sa automatic na ako since automatic naman kasi yung kotse naming. basically i get a discount 😂 so while driving, eto ang napansin ko: * liberating pala magdrive. kaya gets ko na kung bakit may mga tao na mahilig sa kotse. i was thinking of buying a motorcycle for commute. pero napapaisip ako na kotse na lang, given the convenience and the feeling of being comfortable inside an ac rather than being boiled sa init. * driving with bikers (both peddal and mannual) is never wracking. i bike to work for almost 5 years na. now i see why maiinit ang ulo ng mga drivers kapag may bike na kasalubong. more so yung mga walang pake. * medyo forgiving pa ang roads ngayon since walang mga jeep. pero i imagine mas magiging annoying kung babalik na sila. * more of an art ang pagdrarive. yes, may science para paandarin ang kotse. pero yung decision making at how you decide on what to do sa road. ang mentality ko is more of waiting for the object in front of me to finish rather than iwasan siya. something i practice when i bike. so i need the experience to calculate kung puwede ko ba iwasan eto or hintayin na lang. need more time driving to establish that. now that's out of the way, ang next problem ko is getting a non-pro. since wala pang 2 weeks since i had mine. need to wait for 31 days para makapag-apply for non-pro. since pumunta ako sa only lto na malapit sa area namin na puwede ka mag-apply ng non-pro. para makapag start, need ko pumila ng 4am para lang ma entertain since my quota sila. that's bullshit. again, yung parang dfa sana gawin nila, edi hindi na kailangan pahirapan pa ang taong bayan. yes, driving is a privilege. pero wag namann gawin pasakit ang pagkuha. anyway, i know this is frowned upon. so binigyan ako ng option na i bypass ang quota shit na iyan. besides the extra that i need to pay, ang gusto lang ng lto na kausap ng contact ko is i pasa ko yung exam nila. the driving practical (since nag driving school na ako) and the medical are already waived. basta alam ko ang batas at ang rules of the road, bibigyan na nila ako ng non-pro. that's good for me. hindi niya nilalabag yung principles ko na cheating. i still need to exert effort pa din. yung pasakit lang na pumila ng sobrang aga ang ayoko. anyway, yun lang naman. just want to share kasi baong life experience sa akin. 😂",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/h0rhc1/story_time_things_i_notice_as_a_first_time_driver/,11 06 2020
"alex, tanghaling tapat ng sabado, 2021","(any review for this is very-very much appreciated. i'm an aspiring writer po and i just launched a passion project anthology, isa po ito sa mga kwento) &#x200b; **chairman** ngayon ko lang naranasan ‘to sa tagal ko nang nanunungkulan sa barangay. isama mo na sa mga karanasang ‘yon ang lahat ng away mag-asawa, suntukan ng mga lasing, at mga batang ginagahasa sa bukiran. pero eto… ngayon ko lang napansin na buong araw ko na palang hinihimas ang rosaryong nakasabit sa leeg ko. maya’t-maya ko pa hinahalikan at binubulungan na sana’y wag mangyari sa pamilya ko ang nakita ko kanina. naririnig ko pa rin ang sigaw ni cecil, kumare’t-kapitbahay namin, tanghaling tapat ng sabado, kung saan ang tanghalian sa buong kalsada nami’y naantala dahil sa kanyang nakakakilabot na sigaw. sa ilalim ng nagbabagang init ay nagsitakbuhan kami upang sumaklolo. kinailangan ko pang iwanan ang tinola ni misis at ang isang basong softdrinks na nilalanguyan pa dalawang yelo nang ako’y tumakbo papunta sa bahay ni cecil. ngayo’y hindi pa rin ako kumakain. sa totoo nga’y hindi pa ako nakakaranas ng gutom. hindi ko pa ata kaya. sa bahay ni cecil ay dinatnan namin ang katawan ng panganay ni cecil na si joe na nakaratay sa braso ng kanyang bunsong kapatid na si alex, sa sahig ng kanilang sala. sa leeg ni joe ay nakabaon ang basag na bote na ginamit ni alex na balot na balot sa dugo ng kanyang kapatid. agad ang kapit at halik ko sa aking rosaryo nang makita ko ang imahe; na parang sinaunang obra na naglalahad ng malagim na kwento. pero ano ang kwento neto? hanggang ngayon ay wala pa rin kaming ideya kung bakit. magmula sa pagsigaw ni cecil ng, “anong nangyari?! anak, anong nangyari?!” sa tulalang alex na nakatitig sa dilat na mga mata ni joe, hanggang sa pagpunta namin dito sa aking opisina sa barangay, ay wala pa rin kaming makuhang rason mula sa bakit. sa isang maliit na kwarto sa aking opisina’y pinaupo ko muna si alex. tulala at sinusubukang burahin ang dugo sa kanyang mukha gamit ang duguan ring damit n’ya. hinainan ko ng isang bote ng softdrinks at tatlong pandesal mula pa sa agahan namin kanina si alex, na agad namang n’yang kinain ng walang pag-aalinlangan. dito na nagsimulang gumapang ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod. isang kilabot na hindi ko maipaliwanag, habang pinapanood ko si alex na walang awat sa pagkain, habang ako’y hindi ko pa rin magawang matakam sa masarap na lutong nag-aabang sa’kin sa bahay. “alex,” marahan kong sinabi. “ba’t mo ginawa ‘yun?” tumingin lamang sa’kin si alex, patay na mga mata, bibig na mabagal ang nguya. at sa kanyang paglunok ay walang mga salitang bumalik sa’kin. hindi ko alam kung bakit pero bigla kong naalala si jefferson, isang tricycle driver dito sa’min. dalawang taon na ang nakakalipas nang mapatay n’ya ang isang dayo na nakaaway n’ya sa kalsada. nangyari ‘to nang kamuntikan n’yang makasalpukan ang sasakyan ng dayo, at nang nahinto silang dalawa’y nagkasagutan muna sila bago mapikon si jefferson. hinampas n’ya ng bakal na tubo ang dayo. hindi na raw n’ya napigilan dahil sa mga mapanglait na mga salitang tinawag sa kanya. bobo, unggoy, uling, mababa. labing-isang beses paulit-ulit na hinampas ni jefferson sa ulo ang dayo, at sa sobrang lakas ng bawat hampas ay may parte na ng utak na lumabas dito. sa prisinto’y naalala ko si jefferson, iyak nang iyak at humihingi ng tawad dahil sa nangyari. hindi makakain, hindi rin makatulog. nilamon na s’ya ng konsensya n’ya, at ang konsensya n’ya ang tumulak sa kanya na agawin ang baril ng isa sa mga pulis na nagbabantay, at iputok sa kanyang sariling ulo. nasaktan si jefferson, nagalit, at di nakapagpigil. naintindihan ko ang kwento ‘nun. pero bakit hindi ko maintindihan ‘to? alam kong magkasundo ang magkapatid na ‘to. alam ko kung ga’no sila kalapit sa isa’t-isa. kaya pa’no nangyari ‘to? ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod ay gumagapang paakyat hanggang sa aking dibdib, tila ba kumakapit ng mahigpit. pasikip nang pasikip at medyo nahihirapan akong huminga. ang kakaibang pakiramdam na ‘to’y tumitindi habang nanatiling tahimik at nakatitig lamang sa’kin si alex. biglang iniabot ni alex ang kanyang kamay at dito tumalon na ang puso ko. napaatras ako sa aking kinauupuan, at mabilisan kong hinugot ang aking rosaryo mula sa pagkakatago nito sa aking damit. itinutok ko ito kay alex, na walang ibang kibo kun’di ang kunin ang bote ng softdrinks na nasa harapan n’ya. mas bumilis pa ang pagkatok sa aking dibdib, na para bang kamuntikan na kong mamatay. habang si alex nama’y pinapanood lang ako habang patuloy ang kanyang pag-inom. wala nga ata talagang mangyayari, at nang maramdaman ko kung gaano katahimik ang kwarto’y kumalma na ako. bakit sa dulo ng utak ko’y hinihiling ko na may sapi o di kaya’y isang demonyo talaga ang kaharap ko, at sa presensya ng aking rosaryo’y masasaktan s’ya. kahit anong kakaiba. kahit ano basta magkaroon lang ng eksplenasyon ang nangyari. pero siguro’y kakaiba na rin ang ikinikilos ng bata. at siguro nga’y mas dapat talaga akong matakot sa buhay kaysa sa patay. **cecil** “saan ba ko nagkulang?” tanong ni aling cecil sa mga kumare n’yang nakapalibot sa kanya sa masikip na opisina ni chairmain. napapaligiran din s’ya ng makukulay na mga pamaypay na hindi sabay-sabay ang pagaspas sa harap n’ya; nilulunod si aling cecil sa hangin. ang kanyang mukha nama’y tila ba isang rebulto ng santo kung punas-punasan ng mga panyo. “hindi ko pa rin maintindihan,” dugtong n’ya. “hindi naman ako nagkulang sa aruga. pareho ko namang pinapakita sa kanila na pantay ang pagmamahal ko sa kanila.” tuyo na ang mga mata ni aling cecil, ngunit tila ba hindi pa rin tapos ang kanyang pag-iyak. “hindi sila nag-aaway. hindi ko man lang narinig na nagtalo silang dalawa. o kung may pagtatalo man, malamang sa malamang maliit na bagay lang ‘yun. hindi yung ikakamatay mo!” isang labi ng lumapit sa tenga ni aling cecil, “alam mo tingin ko, baka inggit ‘yan. kasi si joe lang may trabaho sa kanilang dalawa, di ba? tapos si alex, wala pa rin sa kolehiyo. nag-aaral pa rin. sigurado akong ‘yun ang dahilan.” isa pang labi ang lumapit sa kabilang tenga naman ni aling cecil, “baka napikon na. kasi di ba halos s’ya na sa lahat ng gawaing bahay? baka pakiramdam n’ya porke’t mas malaki ambag ng kapatid n’ya , alila na s’ya neto.” isang labi naman na kaharap ni aling cecil ang nagsabing, “baka nagbabait-baitan lang kasi nga si joe ang halos sumasalo sa mga bayarin, pati sa pag-aaral n’ya. pero galit talaga s’ya, kasi baka naman may pagkakataong mas nabibigyang-atensyon si joe kahit hindi n’yo napapansin. kasi halimbawa uuwi s’yang pagod galing sa trabaho, syempre di n’yo maiwasang alagaan, pagsilbihan.” sa gitna ng mga labing ito’y si aling cecil, at ang ideyang unti-unting nabubuo dahil sa mga sinasabi ng mga labi sa kanya. “siguro,” sabi n’ya. “siguro nga.” **abbie** ang pangalan n’ya’y abbie. social worker daw s’ya. pagpasok n’ya’y agad bumungad sa’kin ang asul na bra sa ilalim ng dilaw na blouse nang tapatan ito ng liwanag mula sa bintanang katabi ko. sa kanyang pagtali ng buhok ay nakita kong basang-basa na ang kanyang kili-kili at kumikinang na sa pawis ang kanyang leeg. “alex?” sabi n’ya habang maya’t-mayang tinutulak ng kanyang daliri ang salamin n’yang dumudulas sa kanyang matangos na ilong. “bakit di mo ikwento muna sa’kin ang nangyari bago tayo umalis dito?” pasensya ka na, abbie. hindi ko nagawang sabihin kay chairman, na kilala pa mandin namin. hinding-hindi ko rin masasabi sa’yo. walang ibang maglalahad ng nangyari kun’di ang mga taong nais magbigay kahulugan dito, kasi kung ako tatanungin kung bakit, sa totoo lang, hindi ko rin alam ang isasagot. may nabasag akong bote sa kusina kanina, at sa pagpulot ko nito’y pumasok sa isip ko ang isang udyok. yung tipo ng udyok kapag nasa mataas kang lugar, at bigla mo na lang gustong itulak ang kasama mo. pero alam mong hindi ito dapat gawin, at kakapit ka pa nang mas mahigpit sa kanila para masiguro mong hindi ito mangyayari. ang udyok na ito’y nagsabi sa’kin na isaksak ko kay kuya ang basag na bote. at nalaman ko na lang na totoo na pala ang lahat nang dumapo sa aking balat ang mainit na dugo ni kuya. nahinto lang ako nang maramdaman ko ang buto sa leeg n’ya at nang marinig kong nabibilaukan na s’ya sa kanyang sariling dugo. hindi ko pa rin alam kung bakit. sana, tulad ng iniisip ni chairman, ay nasapian na nga lang ako. pero nakita ko ang lahat, andun ako. hindi ko lang alam na totoo pala ang lahat. namatay si kuya joe sa wala. at hindi ko matanggap na wala. normal lang sana ang sabado namin. tahimik. nanonood lang si kuya ng tv, naglilinis ako sa kusina. si nanay nama’y namamalengke ng pananghalian namin. bicol express daw ang lulutuin n’ya. puta, sinira ko ang araw. gusto kong umiyak dahil hindi na kami babalik sa salo-salo namin. “alex?” muling tawag ni abbie. “gusto kong malaman kung bakit. tayong dalawa lang. kaibigan mo ko dito. hinding-hindi ko ‘to sasabihin sa nanay mo, sa mga kapitbahay n’yo. may mga naririnig ako sa labas na dahil daw sa inggit? totoo ba ‘to? sa inggit nga? magmula nang dinala ako ni chairman dito sa maliit na kwartong ito’y napagpasyahan kong manahimik na lang sa nangyari. sa ngayo’y nilalabanan ko ang mga luha, nilalabanan ko ang panginginig ng aking bibig, at ang mga salitang gustong lumabas mula sa’kin. dapat mukhang hindi ko pinagsisisihan. dapat mukha akong galit. para naman mabigyang halaga, mabigyan ng ibig-sabihin ang pagkamatay ni kuya joe. dapat tinatatak ko sa utak ko na dapat lang! dapat lang sa kanya ang nangyari. dapat hindi ako bibigay. dahil kapag natalo ako, mamatay talaga sa wala si kuya. “sige, kung ayaw mong magkwento, ako muna. kasi naalala ko ‘tong isang batang babae at ang tatay n’yang abusado. tatay n’yang lasinggero. tatay n’yang isang beses s’yang hinipuan sa kanyang sariling kwarto at pinilit. ampon ang batang ‘yon, at tatay-tatayan n’ya lang etong umaabuso sa kanya. takot na takot ang bata dahil pakiramdam n’ya isang gabi’y papatayin na lang s’ya bigla neto. kaya naman isang gabi, nang bigla s’yang pinuntahan ng kanyang tatay upang pagsamantalahan ulit, sinasaksak ito ng bata gamit ang lapis sa mata, sa leeg, at sa dibdib.” kumuha ng panyo si abbie. sa kanyang paggalaw ay muling sumisilip ang kanyang bra sa likod ng blouse na parang mga batang naglalaro sa likod ng kurtina. “masarap sa pakiramdam, pero pumapatay pa rin s’ya ng tao. ilan taon n’yang dinibdib ‘yun. hanggang ngayon nararamdaman pa rin n’ya ang mga kamay ng tatay n’ya sa kanyang ari. sa kanyang dibdib. ilang taon bago n’ya matanggap ang ginawa n’ya. ngayon, medyo mahirap pa ring ikwento, pero kahit papaano’y kaya ko na. nangyari na kasi.” para bang may sumuntok sa aking dibdib nang marinig ko ‘to. bigla kong tinanggal ang aking paningin sa kanyang bra, at sa paggalaw ng aking mga mata’y bigla kong naramdaman ang pamumuo ng mga luha. “ayos lang, alex. pero andito lang ako. aalagaan ka muna namin. tapos pag handa ka na, makikinig ako. kahit pakonte-konte pa, ayos lang. aantayin kong mabuo ang kwento mo.” bumibilis bigla ang tibok ng puso ko. lalong nanginginig ang aking labi. at biglang pumasok si kuya sa isip ko, tumatakbo papalayo sa akin. mga bata pa kami, at hinahabol ko s’ya. “alex?” kuya wag kang lumayo! “alex?” kuya dito ka lang! kailangan kita dito! “sige, ayusin na natin pag-alis mo.” at parang isang batang nadapa sa semento, dito na walang awat na tumulo ang luha sa aking mga mata. “alex?” “hindi ko rin alam… hindi… ko rin alam. sorry, kuya! sorry! hindi ko rin alam kung bakit! patayin n’yo na lang ako! hindi ko alam anong nangyari! hindi ko na kaya!” lumalabo na ang aking paningin, pero kahit ga’no kalabo ang aking mga mata’y kitang-kita ko ang gulat at takot sa mukha ni abbie. pasensya ka na, kuya.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/nlygsa/alex_tanghaling_tapat_ng_sabado_2021/,27 05 2021

Paano kayo nagccope up sa pagkawala ng mahal ninyo sa buhay?,"it's been 2 weeks since my father died. sobrang bilis, ang lakas niya pa lang tapos bigla na lang siyang nastroke. sabi ng doctor niya makakauwi na siya, pero yung day na dapat uuwi na siya ang day ng libing niya. hanggang ngayon, hindi pa rin mawala sa isip ko kung may pagkukulang ang mga doctor ni papa. doctor ni papa na cardiologist ang humawak sa case niya, nadiagnose siya ng hemorrhagic stroke, pumutok ang ugat sa utak niya at kailangan pigilan ang pagkalat ng dugo. sobrang confident namin sa doc ni papa kasi sabi magaling daw, ang sabi after 5 days ic-ct scan ulit si papa. ang lakas ni papa kahit nung 1-2 days niya sa icu. inaalis niya pa ngt sa ilong niya and malikot ang left side niya though hindi niya magalaw ang right side ng katawan niya at hindi namin siya makausap. 3rd day ni papa sa icu, sinabihan siya ng doctor niya na makakalabas na siya ng icu ng thursday (saturday ng madaling araw na stroke si papa at nadala namin siya agad sa ospital). at sabi, saturday makakauwi na siya sa amin. ayan ang advise ng doc niya sa amin bago umalis ang doc ni papa at nagseminar o may pinuntahan sa ibang bansa at iniwan sa isang doc na iternist. that day, nanghina si papa. ang dating malakas na grip na kamay niya at malikot niyang paggalaw ay humina... akala namin okay na... sobrang taranta na namin at late na na may nakapagsabi sa amin na kakilala na bakit walang neurologist si papa. kailangan daw niya neuro. late rin namin nalaman na cardio and internist doctors lang humahawak kay papa. before that, tanong na kami nang tanong sa mga nurses. nagtanong pa kami bakit hindi pa ict-scan si papa dahil nanghina siya. ang sabi, hindi na raw kailangan daw lalabas na siya. binawasan din mga gamot niya. kaso ang sabi nagka-infection daw siya sa dugo dahil hindi mawala ang lagnat niya kay binigyan siya ng antibiotics. thursday nang malaman namin na walang neuro si papa at kailangan niya ng neuro. pinilit namin na ipatingin si papa sa neuro kahit na nagagalit na samin mga nurses. cardio raw ang kailangan ni papa at hindi neuro. pinapirma kami ng waiver na kami ang nag-ask for neuro at hindi ang doctor ni papa. turns out, nang icheck siya ng neuro bakit daw hindi na-ct scan agad. dapat 2-3 days na ct scan daw ulit para malaman kung namaga utak ni papa. mali pa raw ang antibiotics na ibinibigay kay papa, sobrang baba raw dapat daw malakas dahil sa utak nga daw ang problema ni papa. thursday night, bumagsak katawan ni papa. ang gcs niya from 10 nang dinala namin siya sa ospital to 3. kumalat na daw ang dugo sa utak ni papa as per result ng ct scan sabi ng neuro niya baka kailanganin niya ng surgery. that night, sobrang bumaba bp niya, naging abnormal heartbeat niya at super nahirapan siyang huminga nilagyan na siya ng tube. super sakit akala namin makakauwi na siya tapos friday ng madaling araw nawala na siya. super sakit, before siya mastroke pinag-uusapan pa lang namin graduation ko. sabi niya super proud siya sa amin magkakapatid. ngayon hindi na niya ako makikitang ggraduate....yung panganay niya, walang tatay sa graduation. hindi ko alam kung may pagkukulang mga doctors niya or what, until now di pa rin namin nassettle ang bill. ang hirap magsalita kasi di naman kami expert pero para sa akin may pagkukulang sila. hindi ko sila sinisisi pero ang sama-sama ng loob ko!!! may times na parang okay na, pero kapag naaalala ko si papa... ang sakit-sakit, sobrang miss ko na siya. sobrang miss ko na ang papa ko. unang anak niya na mapapagraduate niya ng college, hindi niya makikita... kahit na mahirap, pinag-aaral niya kaming apat. ang sakit-sakit pa rin... hindi ko alam paano magccope up sa pagkawala ni papa...",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/14hwjjn/paano_kayo_nagccope_up_sa_pagkawala_ng_mahal/,24 06 2023
Creatures of Philippine Lower Mythology,"reading this book it details the physical attributes, magic and power, capabilities and domiciles of philippine lower mythological beings like demons (kapre, tikbalang) aswangs, witches, mermaids and engkantos. the book taps the history of pre-colonial philippines. the book also explore the comprehensive effects of these creatures in the daily life of filipinos. positive man or negative. while some filipinos believe in the existence of these creatures, some may not. i personally believe that science should triumph over superstitious or primitive beliefs. that everything has a logical explanations be it sa pagkalampag ng bubong (dahil dinapuan ng aswang ang bubong) or itim na aso na umaaligid sa bahay ng may sakit. however, nakakaaliw din magbasa or makinig ng mga stories tungkol sa aswang, mangkukulam, engkanto, tikbalang and etc. so bilang malapit na ang halloween at bilang batang pinanganak ng early 90s na part ng school life yung pinagkwekwentuhan ang mga kwentong kakatakutan kapag ganitong buwan…drop your stories here (narinig man or naexperience) about these creatures of the night.",https://i.redd.it/15237my7qysb1.jpg,8 10 2023

Short Tagalog Story (I hope you like it),"i'm in a creative mood so i thought of writing a short story. mga anito ng maynila **sa may simbahan ng binondo** nakatingin ang babae sa kalesa at sa kabayo na nakapwesto sa harap ng simbahan ng binondo. may maliit na ngiti sa gilid ng kanyang labi. “sakay kayo?” tanong ng kutsero sa babae. “di ko akalaing makakita ako ng ganito dito.” sabi ng babae. “konti na nga lang mga kalesa dito sa maynila. kung gusto nyo ng ikot lang pwede na ang tatlong daan, pa gabi na din kasi.” “salamat, pero di ko po sila kayang sakyan.” “dalawang daan?” “salamat pa rin po.” tumango ang kutsero at bumalik sa panonood sa kanyang cellphone. “hanapin mo ako.” bulong ng babae sa kabayo bago maglakad pa alis. **sa isang murang hotel sa soler st.** nag ring ang telepono sa room 314. “mam, may lalaki po dito hinahanap kayo.” “paki patuluyin mo sa kwarto ko.” “bukas yan” ang sagot ng babae pagka katok sa kanyang pinto. “nakita mo ang ilaw ng kandila?” tumango ang mama. “pwede ba?” tanong ng lalaki nung binunot nya ang pakete ng fortune. humindi ang babae at tinuro ang “no-smoking” sign sa kwarto. “nagulat ako nung nakita kita kanina, di ko inakalang may… kagaya mo dito sa siyudad.” “at di ko din inakalang may manananggal na bibisita sa siyudad at tumabi pa sa simbahan.” “walang epekto ang simbahan sa akin, taga panga-alaga pa nga ako ng mga santo sa amin. kung alam lang ng mga tao dun.” tumingin tingin ang lalaki sa kwarto. may kandilang itim na naka sindi sa maliit na lamesa at may maleta na may sticker ng cebu pacific na galing tagbilaran sa sahig. “galing ka ng bohol?” “sa loon. nakita ko ang pangalan mo sa kalesa. richard nga ba ang pangalan mo?” tumango ang lalaki. “ako si avelina pero lina na lang itawag mo sa akin” “ano ang pakay mo dito?” “hinahanap ko si bathala.” “di na sya ang bathalang tulad ng dati.” “nandito nga sya? kaya mo ba akong samahan papunta sa kanya?” nagisip isip si richard at walang maisagot sa babae. “may sakit ako at konti na lang ang oras ko dito, sya na lang ang pag asa ko.” “sasamahan kita sa kanya, pero wag ka magugulat sa makikita mo.” bumaba papuntang lobby ang dalawa at lumabas ng hotel. kahit lagpas alas-onse ng gabi ay madami pa din mga kotse sa kalsada. “malayo ba sya?” “walang deretsong jeep papunta sa pwesto nya, lakarin na lang natin.” sarado na ang mga tindahan bukod sa mga 7-11 na nadaraanan ng dalawa. nakapag sindi na din ng sigarilyo si richard habang nag lalakad. “matagal ka na dito sa maynila?” “mga tatlumpung taon na.” “alam ng kutsero kung ano ka?” “oo, mabait ang pamilyang yun sa akin. yung kutsero kanina, anak na yun ng may ari ng kalesa.” “meron din kagaya mo sa bohol, pero sa ibang lugar sila nakatira. may kilala akong apat na kagaya mo doon.” “ikaw pa lang ang manananggal na nakita ko dito sa loob ng apat na taon. may nakilala ako dati na nagging flight stewardess. mahilig yata kayo talagang lumipad.” “di ko yata kaya ang mawalay sa mga tanim at alaga ko. parang ikaw, mukha naman kuntento ka na sa pamilyang kumupkop sayo.” “araguy!” napatigil ang matandang babae dahil sa sakit sa tagiliran. inalalayan naman sya ni richard. “mabilis sana kung lumipad tayo, pero di ko alam saan ang pupuntahan natin.” “di mo ako kayang bitbitin, manang” “akala mo lang, tikbalang” “malapit na din tayo, ulitin ko lang, wag ka magulat sa makikita mo.” tumango si avelina sa sinabi ni richard. nakarating sila sa quiapo church at naglakad patungo sa mga eskinita sa tabi nito. may tindahan ng mga halamang gamot at iba rito ay nasa botelya. “pampa-regla” “gamot sa eksema” mga nakadikit sa bote. may matandang lalaking panot at mabahong natutulog sa tabi ng tindahan na ito. “sya ang hinahanap mo” sabi ni richard kay manang. lumuhod si manang kay bathala at binaba ang ulo. umubo si richard para magising si bathala. walang nangyari at patuloy lang sa pag hilik ang matandang lalaki. tinapik na ni richard ang upuan ng lalaki kaya ito nagising. nagulat si bathala ng makitang si manang avelina na nakaluhod sa harapan nya sabay tingin kay richard. “hoy kamusta, richard? buhat na dyan, di mo kailangan gawin yan, basta may pambayad ka may gamot ako dito. hula ko hindi pampa regla ang kailangan mo.” “bumyahe pa yan mula bohol para makita ka.” sabi ni richard. “meron po akong sakit at kailangan ko ang tulong nyo.” “ano ang sakit mo?” at kinuwento nga ni manang avelina ang kanyang mga sintomas at nakinig naman si bathala. “pasensya ka na, pero wala akong maitutulong sa sakit mo. mga gamot na mabibigay ko ay pantulong lang sa kirot pero di ito mapapahaba ang buhay mo.” “naniniwala pa po ako sa inyong kapangyarihan. baka pwede nyo pong gamitin ang kapangyarihan nyo sa akin.” natawa si bathala. “nakikita mo ba ako? tatlong araw na akong di nakakaligo at nagbabantay na lang ako ng tindahan na ito. dito ako natutulog dahil wala akong bahay. alam mo kung bakit ko piniling pumwesto dito sa simbahan ng quiapo? para maramdaman ko man lang na ako ang sinasamba ng mga tao pero hindi ako ang sinasamba nila kaya’t wala na akong kapangyarihan. ang mangilan-ngilan na kapangyarihan ko sa mga mangigilan na bumubulong ng pangalan ko sa kanilang dasal ay binubuhos ko sa mga gamot na to.” “alam mo sinasamba ng mga tao ngayon? pera. wala din ako nyan. mukha bang malakas ang bentahan ng pwesto ko? pero bebentahan kita ng gamot dahil di pa din ako kumakain ng pang gabi. itong isang bote na to, 350 na lang. inumin mo to isang kutsara sa umaga at isa sa gabi para sa sakit. pero ulitin ko, di ka nito mapapagaling.” kumuha ng pera si manang avelina sa kanyang pitaka at ibinayad kay bathala. “salamat! bumalik ka, hija! at kung maari, babalik na ako sa tulog ko. richard, daan ka ulit dito minsan. kwentuhan tayo.” “salamat pa rin po, dakilang bathala.” at naglakad na pabalik patungo sa hotel ang dalawa. “ayoko man isipin at ayokong maniwala, pero pera na nga yata ang kapangyarihan ngayon. yun na din yata ang sagot sa sakit ko.” sabi ni lina habang naglalakad pabalik. “at least kung may pera ako may pang ospital ako.” “kung di ka din matutulungan ni bathala at pera din lang pala sagot sa problema mo baka hindi si bathala ang pinuntahan natin.” “sino?” “si pilandok” hope to be continued",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/vy5jhx/short_tagalog_story_i_hope_you_like_it/,13 07 2022

DepEd?,"mga bata ngayon takot magkasakit simply because may mga mamimiss silang activities, and i know some people na pumapasok parin even though masama pakiramdam nila. actually sa classroom namin ang dami na nagkakahawaan pero pinupursigi nalang nila pumasok without thinking of the others' health man lang, just because madaming long quiz sa araw na iyon. yung iba nag sisinungaling din sa health declarations nila kasi iniisip nila baka pauwiin sila. pano naman ako magiging kampante sa school na onti lang yung risk sa classroom namin kung hindi naman sumusunod sa protocols mga kaklase ko, tapos hindi pa sila mag mamask. anong klaseng sistema to? pakisama, anyone? alam ko naman na since in the middle tayo ng pandemic ngayon wala talagang kasiguraduhan na safe tayo sa sakit, and sino ba naman may gugustong pumasok sa klase na madaming may sakit diba? edi if covid nga, naka hawa ka pa sa family mo pag uwi mo from classes. so ano na? tapos ung teachers hindi ba alam ung protocol? as far as i know, ang protocol is kapag may symptom hindi na dapat pinapapasok. bat sa amin, pasok daw pag kaya, so sinasabi niyo po ba na kahit may sakit, as long as kaya ng katawan, papasok parin? issue din sa canteen namin. siksikan tuwing recess. alam ko naman na normal lang yan pero, hindi manlang naka mask ung iba... tapos minsan may maririnig ka pag uubo ubo tas sisinghot sa pilahan, like tf? san na napunta ung health protocols na sinasabi niyo?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/zc6za8/hello_deped/,4 12 2022
Permanent WFH Setup: Filipinos Should Look Into Virtual Assistant (VA) Industry,"i want to share this here hoping that it could help some people who are tired from the daily commute that they have to endure just to get to work. marami pa ibang dahilan bakit gusto mag wfh ng isang tao katulad ng: * kailangan mag alaga ng anak o kapamilya na may sakit o matanda na, * malayo ang bahay sa trabaho kaya gusto makatipid sa pamasahe/gas, * estudyante na gusto ng pang allowance/tuition, * may sakit pero kailangan pa rin magtrabaho para may kita, * etc. virtual assistant (va) is a general term that refers to freelancers working **remotely** for **foreign clients**. merong mga freelancers na hindi remote workers (e.g. photographer, model, insurance agent, etc.) kaya wag ka malilito sa term na ""freelancer"" at ""va"". vas yung mga nagtatrabaho sa bahay, sa coffee shop, sa beach, kahit saan kase ""remote worker"" sila. never nila poproblemahin ang return-to-office (rto) order kase nasa ibang bansa yung client nila. anong pwede maging trabaho ng va? depende sa designation. a va can be a/an: * administrative assistant, * architect, * auditor, * bookkeeper, * content creator, * customer service representative, * graphic designer, * human resource, * it personnel * paralegal, * seo specialist, * social media manager, * web developer, * writer, * etc. halos lahat ng designation pwede ma-categorize as va basta permanent wfh + foreign client. just like traditional jobs, you need to apply for the position, undergo interview, training and you can be laid off too due to poor performance, bankruptcy, world crisis, etc. > pros ng pagiging va 1. permanent wfh setup 2. flexible hours (depending on the contract) 3. salary in foreign currency 4. lower tax rate 5. work-life balance > cons ng pagiging va 1. you need to be tech savvy to start in this field, 2. saturated market. madami gusto mag wfh ever since nag pandemic, 3. no ph government benefits, ikaw magfa-file ng taxes mo at magbabayad ng contributions mo as self-employed, 4. no hmo, 13th month pay and bonus **unless** mag agree kayo ng client na meron 5. you need to be independent and resourceful kase kung gusto mo tinuturo lahat sayo at wala ka initiative matuto mag isa, mahirap. short story: i became a part-time va (social media manager) in 2016. i worked with an australian client but i left after 6 months kase mababa ang sahod tapos lakas mag micro-manage and nag focus na lang ako sa pag aaral. tumigil ako ng ilang taon, kinalimutan ko na, maliit naman sahod. in 2019, few months before covid lockdown, i tried again because school expenses are hurting my pocket. this time, i am a full-time va (administrative assistant) for a us client. my starting salary was php22,500 and then it went up to 25k to 27k to 50k. i was promoted to operations manager and started earning php100k a month. after graduation and during bar review, i continued working. when i passed the bar exam in 2022, i told my client that i will leave the job so i can focus on my legal career. he does not want me to leave so he doubled my salary from 2k usd to 4k usd (php200k a month). he also pays for our medical insurance, 13th and 14th month pay, monthly bonus and gadget upgrade. currently, i have 2 jobs: va and my traditional job. mahirap ang buhay. kung kaya mag double job, grab it. you can learn to be a va through: 1. reddit (r/buhaydigital) 2. facebook (online filipino freelancers page) 3. youtube 4. other vas 5. google hindi kami hiring ngayon, wag nyo i-send saken resume nyo. protect your identity, this is reddit. i am just hoping that this could help someone who wants a permanent wfh setup. sobrang pahirap yung public transportation system sa pilipinas, and it will take years and good leaders before we see improvements. that's it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/w8j318/permanent_wfh_setup_filipinos_should_look_into/,26 07 2022
Traffic is being normalized in the Philippines,"while on my way to work this morning, i just realized how covid-19 affected us in a good way. of course, i'm not talking about those people who got sick and died but about the fact that somehow it made our commutes/rides easier. now na marami ng nag-return to office and sooner ay start na rin ng face to face classes sa public schools, unti-unti ng bumabalik yung usual traffic na nararanasan natin everyday before. nakakawalang gana lang. i miss those times na konti lang yung taong nakakalabas. ang sakit lang isipin na normal na lang to sa atin. yung ang aga-aga mo na ngang gumigising sa umaga para makipagsapalaran sa pag-cocommute tapos malelate ka pa. yung ang mahal ng pamasahe pero kalahati lang ng pwet mo yung nakaupo. yung ang mahal ng gasolina tapos di mo naman nasusulit kasi ilang oras ka nakastuck sa traffic. haay, it's indeed more fun in the philippines. this is why mas maganda na talagang mag-freelance na lang or maghanap ng work na fully remote. malaki na matitipid mo, less stress pa.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/wljuen/traffic_is_being_normalized_in_the_philippines/,11 08 2022
Open your eyes,"i will begin by prefacing that i am nobody special, i do not have any redeeming qualities or anything that set me apart from the mass. my only service to the country is the money that i pay in the form of taxes, as well as my desire for it to improve. i will not hide behind a falsified pretense, and i will be upfront and direct. all throughout my life, i've always harbored distaste towards philippines. to me, it was largely unruly and hypocritical; i was forced to suffer through a life so intricately tied to politics. a large number of my family members are connected to politics, i grew up hearing and seeing about politics. my aunts and uncles? politicians. that isn't to say that i have a keen understanding and comprehension of it, no. i am not an analyst, nor am i sagacious enough to pinpoint the finer details of such things. at first, i wanted to become a great person. a lawyer to uphold the law. or perhaps a soldier to fight in the frontlines to protect it. but that steadily deteriorated until money became what i desired, i wanted to become a teacher so that i may teach and at the same time earn money. then even that shattered under the weight of this society. perhaps this is what many would construe as an existential dread; i knew not what i wished to do. in time, i began to grow jaded and exhausted of it all, eventually ceasing to think about my motherland anymore. i considered it to be too congealed in corruption for it to ever be cleansed of it. but now, it's gotten to the point that i can no longer stop caring or averting my eyes. however, **i am powerless.** all i have to offer now are the experiences that i've gone through, the wisdom i picked up throughout my life, my knowledge and my very creed. my voice may go unheard, my ripple may end up small and my wisdom? obsolete. but that matters not. my fellow filipinos, i implore you, i beseech you, to never stop thinking and to never surrender your self. your ethos and your ego. do not simply conform and follow the tide, do not simply melt into the masses like i have in the past. i have staggered because of it, sacrificing my individuality to fit in. do not make that same mistake. ""i think, therefore i am."" is one of my lifelines, but perhaps it truly is harder to see what is right underneath you as i have failed to employ this line until recently. **i am reaching out not to those who are already awake and can see this injustice, i am calling out to the slumbering hearts of those who support president rodrigo roa duterte, better known as the dds.** i am begging you, my kinsmen. open your eyes. do not surrender your very identity for the sake of money, do not surrender your very ego and allow the society to congeal into yourself, turning you into yet another faceless flock. i know that you are not stupid, i know that you are not foolish. look around you, and think for yourself. listen to the voices around you, the loud cries and the hushed whispers then think for yourself. think, so that you will remain yourself. think, so that you may retain all the years you've spent living your life. you are you, no one else may ever become you. you are a unique existence that can only be a singular person in this entire fabric of reality. do not surrender the treasure that is your ego solely for money, or worse for empty platitudes. think, what has he done for us during this time of crisis? enumerate every single one of them in your mind. list them out, so that you may better quantify the help that you believe he has given us. comprehend and think of every single benefit he may have given us. then think, what has he done against us during this time of crisis? what has he done to oppress us? list them out, seek them out, discern every deed that he may have done that harmed us directly, or indirectly. identify things that he may have **not** done to help us, for there is nothing worse than inaction in a time of need. please, if you would only do this not for me, but for yourself who has lived many years of your life remaining who you are. i am begging you. and to the rest of us, who are wide awake after this harsh jolt from reality. may you accept this heartfelt present if you can read this. accept the lessons i have learned from my life, accept the experiences that i have gone through and catalyzed for those of us in dire straits. even if it hurts, even if it's tiring, even if it doesn't seem to make sense. never stop thinking, never stop trying to understand what is happening. for to think is to be yourself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ftzfc7/open_your_eyes/,3 04 2020

I drop KDramas when the Philippines is mentioned in a bad light,"don't eat me alive for my opinion. wala lang, parang nawawalan ako ng interes pag imemention nila ang pinas na parang takbuhan ng kriminal ganon (kahit totoo, no?). parang nadidismaya ako. i mean, ang dami ng south koreans na nagpupunta dito to learn english, ang dami din sa kanilang nagstart ng businesses dito, and they make so much money from fans of their celebrities... tapos ang ibabalik sa'tin halos laging negative yung connotation. i think the only half-assed effort i saw their writers do was to mention that the main kontrabida girlies were going off to cebu for a vacay - pero parang hindi sila masyadong excited? yung delivery eh, parang ""it's just a cheap vacation though\~ugh\~""... and cebu is *not* a cheap vacay spot for us naman? like, ang ganda kaya sa cebu? i'm aware naman na hindi lang ph ang namemention nila in a bad light. they also mention other countries like china, sure, pero it kind of puts me off and leaves a sour taste in my mouth when they sprinkle in this detail in their dialogues. of course, favorite theme din naman ng tv shows and movies natin ang social problems and such pero idk basta for me i don't like it when i see it sa kdrama hahaha. aamin ko din, talagang mas maganda naman talaga quality ng stories ng kdramas - i appreciate how they always manage to churn out unique and entertaining shows while following their tried and tested formulas. and i really like the new non-cutesy ones - maybe cos i've graduated from romcoms to thrillers and action shows. wag niyo akong tanungin kung ano yung mga show yung mga drinop ko, nakalimutan ko na titles nila.ang naalala ko lang cloy hahaha! usually fleeting lang naman yung lines na yon pero once kasi na nakita ko, nawawala na talaga interes ko. yun lang po. end rant. :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/180hw6x/i_drop_kdramas_when_the_philippines_is_mentioned/,21 11 2023

'ano naman to.' then dm sa akin 'anong pinagsasasabi mo? pinapahiya mo magulang mo. di ka nahihiya?' nagdilim na lang paningin ko. every time na binabara nila ako sa posts ko about bbm or sara, technically, pinapahiya nila ako. di ba sila nahihiya? sobrang daming naunpack after that. sa totoo lang, di naman sila ganyan kadouchebags. naging ganyan lang after the elections. parang every time na kinicriticise mo ang mga marcos, offended na offended sila. wala akong tinatawag na bobo or tanga. i accepted na yun binoto nila. never ko sila ininsulto, pero kinacall out ko ang gobyerno.

Matanda sa Bus (Ghost Story),"pauwi ako ng baguio for the barangay elections. the trip via bus from manila was fine. nothing special since sanay naman na akong pabalik-balik from manila to baguio. but this one time, october 28, 2023, to be specific, has become one of the most unforgettable biyahe moments ko. it was around 2:00 am na and paakyat na ng baguio yung bus (a couple hours na lang baguio na), i was asleep pero nagising ako kasi nakaramdam ako ng parang bump which is normal naman. and then i felt na kailangan ko i-adjust yung pants ko kasi kasi medyo hindi na comfy so i had to stand up to do it. tapos for a quick reference l was sitting at the middle part of the bus. habang inaayos ko yung pants ko i saw an old woman boarded the bus. hindi pa ako nagsususpetsa that time coz i wasn't expecting such incident to happen so the first na pumasok sa isip ko bakit hindi inaalalayan ni kuyang kundoktor si lola? and also, bakit naka-dim pa rin yung mga ilaw? ang hindi pumasok sa isip ko, paano siya nakasakay e umaandar? eh itong part ng biyahe na ito is yung part kung saan mabilis yung patakbo ng bus. so nung umupo na ako, i was still looking at the old woman na naglalakad nang mabagal. this time i was aware na something was off. something was paranormal. i was staring at her (the old woman) that time nang kalabitin ako nung ""auntie"" sitting next to me. she said but in ilocano, something like ""wag mong titigan nang titigan kasi baka sumunod sayo."" those words sent shiver to my spine as the old woman gets closer to our spot. sobrang pigil na pigil hininga ko nung dumaan siya sa tabi ko. tapos as she gets closer sobrang clear ng details ng damit niya. she was wearing a navy blue dress na parang sobrang luma (sorry not good with history), pero basically tao siya nung unang panahon. she was also wearing a feathered hairpin idk something like that. may tungkod rin siya na naririnig ko every time ahe steps. pero hindi ko maaninag yung mukha niya. also nung dumaan siya sobrang pungent nung amoy parang masusuka ka sa amoy. nakahinga lang ako (or kami) nung lumagpas na siya sa amin. parang ayaw kong gumalaw that time, and then after siguro mga 30-40 minutes narinig nanaman namin yung tungkod niya and it's approaching. sabi nung ""auntie"" beside me, wag ko daw papansinin kasi sumasama daw yung mga ganun. again the smell nung malapit na siya. tapos what made me cry a little sa sobrang takot is nung nakita ko yung likuran niya, may nakatusok na kahoy idk, tapos some kind of tar was streaming out galing dun sa pinagtusukan. tapos parang walang nangyare nung nakababa na siya. pero when i got in front of our gate halos gibain ko na yung pundasyon sa sobrang takot huhuhu next time na bbiyahe ako pauwi may kasama na ako!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/17j55v2/matanda_sa_bus_ghost_story/,29 10 2023
"Kwento ni kuyang Rider kanina, tumatagay daw asawa nya ng gin na may zonrox habang nag iinuman","malupit to seryoso isheshare ko na to sa maraming tao bago ko pa makalimutan. so sumakay ako ng motor kanina(di ko sasabihin kung anong app ginamit ko baka kasi may kakilala sya dito) kasi may imimeet ako, and tinanong ni kuya kung papasok ba daw ako ng trabaho, sabi ko ""hindi kuya may kikitain ako"", tas sabi nya ""ah, kaya pala posturang postura ka sir eh"". tas dahil dun napa kwento sya about sa asawa nyang taga probinsya, sabi nya di na daw maganda takbo ng relationship nya pero wala syang solid reason para makipag break kahit na maraming red flags si ate tsaka may anak narin daw kasi sila plus maganda si ate mo kaya di nya rin mahiwalayan. so eto yung mga nakwento nya: 1. taga bundok daw si ate so di marunong magluto ng mga normal na pagkain, ang alam lang lutuin is puro gulay na di nya daw alam sang lupalop ng mundo nabibili nung babae, eh wala naman daw sa palengke nung mga yun. nagluluto daw sya sinigang tas walang asim edi parang nilaga lang daw yun. ayaw daw ng asawa nya ng may asim di daw sya sanay. 2. nagtsatsaa daw asawa nya pero pinakuluang damo lang daw, literal yung kinakain daw ng baka na damo. may sinabi syang word na tawag dun eh di ko na maalala kasi puro ""wushh wushh wushh"" nung hangin yung mas naririnig ko ahahha. sa t nagsisimula ata pero tagalog word sya eh. edit: naalala ko na, taragis daw tawag dun sa iniinom ng asawa nya. 3. maraming takot sa asawa nya kasi masama daw tumingin, pero never nya daw nakita yun, basta maganda daw asawa nya, pero di daw nakikita ng ibang tao yun. tas may mga kaibigan pa nga daw syang babae na nanaginip na sinasakal sila nung asawa nya. 4. tingin ng lahat ng kapamilya nya aswang yung babae. kasi eto na nga, nasa title na nung post, umiinom yung babae ng gin tas may halong zonrox. normal daw sa probinsya nila yun, sa surigao ata? paki confirm kung meron mang taga surigao dyan. kaya daw ubusin ng asawa nya kalahating bote nung maliit na zonrox sa isang kwatro kantos ata? nagka family gathering daw sila tas sinama nya asawa nya tas biglang nagtimpla daw ng gin at zonrox sa bote nagalit lahat ng bisita eh akala pinapatay daw sila. tas ginawa nung asawa nya ininom sa harap nila at inubos. after nun di na nya sinama asawa nya sa mga gathering kasi natakot lahat ng bisita sa kanya. akala nya nagtitrip lang asawa nya pero nag iinuman daw sila ng pinsan nung asawa nya at halo daw talaga sa alak nila zonrox. 5. pumunta daw sya dun sa bahay nung babae sa probinsya, tas tinanong nya yung tatay kung bakit sila umiinom ng zonrox kasama ng gin, tas sabi ng tatay nung asawa nya ""normal lang yan dito, eto nga tignan mo oh"" tas kumuha daw ng muriatic ata yun, tas ininom sa harap nya yung isang takip. di nya daw alam anong irereact, pero after nun iniwasan na nya sumama sa inuman kasi yung mga kainuman din daw nila may mga dalang kutsilyo. saksakan daw trip nila pag nagkakainitan ng ulo. never nya raw sinubukan uminom nung gin na may zonrox kasi sino ba namang susubok nun diba? baka daw mamatay sya isang inom pa lang. sabi nga ni kuyang rider, ""pag ako nasiraan ng bait sir una ko talagang gagawin iinom ako ng zonrox sa gin, tutal ginagawa naman ng asawa ko yun"". marami pa syang experience regarding dun sa pagbisita nya sa surigao pero di ko na isheshare kasi masyadong personal na, mga tungkol na sa engkanto at kababalaghan dun sa probinsya. sobrang lupit ng kwento ni kuya napatip ako eh. kung nasan ka man kuya sana buhay ka pa ngayon.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/1859w3g/kwento_ni_kuyang_rider_kanina_tumatagay_daw_asawa/,27 11 2023
"Opinion: In some cases and ways, mas homophobic pa pinays kesa sa male pinoys.","first of all, i was inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/philippines/comments/107679q/why_does_no_one_address_maletomale_sexual/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) sa post nito, andame nagsasabe sa comments na ang homophobic raw ng straight guys. i argue otherwise; in my experience, honestly lang, alam ko ang weird and napaka-counter-intuitive pero mas madame akong kilalang homophobes na straight females kesa sa straight males. crazy, right???!! sobrang dameng beses ko na na-encounter yung mga babaeng nagsasabe na ""omg ang gwapo naman. sayang bakla pala."" and ""ano ba yan andame nang mga bakla. konti nalang mga ""tunay na lalake"" sa panahon ngayon. need i remind you, hindi porket good-looking or attractive yung isang tao, hindi sila obliged or/and hindi entitled mga babae na maging straight yung mga taong yun. subtly napansin ko lanv all over the years kasi ever since elementary ko pa to naririnig, ngayon ko lang na-realize na napaka-homophobic pala ng statements na yan - again - these come from girls. not men. another example is nao-overhear ko lang sa arguments between girls and gays are that pagnatatalo sa usapan yung straight girls, final card nila is ""bakit? tunay na babae ka ba?"" and similar lines. again, wala ako pake. hindi ko kasalanan nao-overhear ko arguments nila sa classroom or in public pero ngayon ko lang din na-realize, parang sobrang taas ng tingin ng mga females just because of their gender and thus homophobic. andame ko din neighbors and friends of relatives na napaka-straight up ang baba ng tingin and diring diri sa mga gay people. one female friend of a relative of mine once said derogatory remarks sa gay tito namin nung may party a few years ago. isa ko pang babaeng classmate na religious noong senior high school sabe (hindi ko matandaan exact words) ""lalake ka talaga, sis. pagna-realize mo sa bible and pag narinig mo calling ni god, malalaman mo na hindi totoo mga bakla."" or something ganun. also, this female classmate rin nagsabe ng ""ay hindi ka marunong magbasketball? hindi ka naman barbie (bakla)?"" like holy shit. (and am very aware that other female pinays think like this, given our upbringing as filipinos). so it may seem like straight females pa ang mas sympathetic sa lgbt community at first glance, it isn't always the case. lahat ng straight guys na kakilala ko either walang pake sa mga gay guys and may isa pa nga ako kakilala na he's a straight guy pero halos.. (tinatantsa ko lang btw) halos 70% ng friends nya ay gay guys or straight girls. although, had to admit, nung high school and elem gays, mas critical ang boys sa lgbt community. pero after high school - pag dating sa shs, college or pag way past 18 na, i realized parang **on the inside** mas homophobic filipino women kesa sa filipino men. ayun lang po, have a good day. edit: another one: last year, may argument sa facebook and one girl said, ""mukha ba kong papatol dyan? tingin nyo magpapa-k*ntot ako dyan? mukha ngang paminta yan."" edit: i can give more examples if y'all want. and plus, handa ako madownote to oblivion and ma-ban ako from r/ph just for speaking the truth based on my experience. it's one of my principles to speak truthfully kahit na hindi angkop sa society na i'm living in.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/107dr7u/opinion_in_some_cases_and_ways_mas_homophobic_pa/,9 01 2023

Managed to leave the country and thought: what in the actual h*ll is wrong with the Philippines,"hello r/philippines! i have left the philippines. this is a post about my disillusionment in the past while living there. brief context: i made a few posts in the past here in the past about a lot of bad stuff that was happening in my life (e.g. my narc pinoy parents filing a false kidnapping report in case i leave the house, and my doubts on if a psychiatrist will actually help me or not if i go to them about my issues) but things have taken a good turn and i have finally managed to leave the country by marrying my dual citizen s/o living abroad (not going to say which country for anonymity reasons). living abroad, i experienced a lot of things that i thought was impossible. here's a few: * i'm earning 100k php a month for an entry-level job. they didn't even ask me to have a bachelor's degree, a pleasing personality and 50 valid ids. * public offices take 20-40 minutes to process documents. i got a resident id on the same day. * the mental health industry actually wants to help me with my mental health conditions (the psychiatrist told me to try consulting with a psychologist first because he warned me that the medications may have unwanted irreversible effects). * my workmates are actually supportive and seek to see me succeed! they said i'm their most promising workmate and they want me to be their manager in the future. * i'm more comfortable opening up to people, they judge me less and they're more inquisitive/open-minded about the things i've went through and my life decisions. * they don't force me into any social interactions. i'm not forced to participate in any social gatherings if i don't wish to. * people are generally more respectful of my boundaries. * i'm not compared to anyone else. * i'm not shamed for my hobbies. * the system doesn't work against me. now, the typical response is to absorb all of this and say ""i'll forget about the shit i went through, i'm finally here where i want to be and am appreciated,"" right? to be honest, i'm disillusioned. why? well, first, i gave my parents a second chance and then stopped going no-contact with them after i finally went abroad. i told them how i was doing and the response i got was: ""edi waw."" ""sana all."" ""sana andiyan ka para saamin."" ""bigyan mo na kami para patawarin namin mga taon na hindi ka nagusap saamin."" ""inisip mo ba yung mga kapatid mo sa ginagawa mo?"" they weren't happy for my achievements. i thought they would finally put behind all those years of abuse i went through from their narcissism, but no, they're bitter that i stopped talking to them because they won't let me move out on their terms. i did what i couldn't before: i gave them my genuine feelings about their response, and told them to not expect any more contact from me in the future. they went, ""sige ka maawa ka saamin."" then i realized, what if i hit them where it hurts? i told them that i will not be sending them any money either anytime in the future. that's when they went ballistic. ""wala kng kwentang anak"" ""ganyan ka sa lahat ginawa namin para sayo?"" ""sinakripisyo kami lahat para sayo"" i told them i don't care. they threatened legal action against me, my s/o, and my s/o's family. i told them ""lol"" then blocked them after. that's something that i never would've done if not for me deciding to take the leap to leave the country. i don't regret my interactions with my parents, but i'm disillusioned with the years i spent in the philippines. i felt like all the years i spent there could've been prevented and avoided by simply not living there. i actually regret being born in into a toxic family within the philippines. then i remembered the things i went through: * i tried to apply for a job that paid 15k per month, but they chose this beauty pageant winner (who allegedly has no job, internship or volunteer experience) even though they said that i have a very promising, experienced resume (i have three internships and a lot of volunteer experience) and that i'm practically good for the job. * to this day i still don't have my national id lmao. i got a fixer for a driver's license, got the bs ""temporary driver's license"" which was literally printed on a piece of a4 paper, and used that for my passport. i don't even know how to drive lmao, i just did that for passport requirements (don't worry, i'm taking driving school in the country i'm currently in!) * i went to a psychiatrist in the philippines, told them all the shit they went through, and said ""we don't believe you, we'll send a social worker to your house to confirm the situation"" even though i already moved out and had evidence of my parents filing false kidnapping charges. plus they gave me a number to call for a comprehensive mental health examination, but the person answering the number was ""disoriented"" or something (probably on drugs? i'm not sure), said they'd call back, but never called back lol. * all my ""friends"" were jealous of my resume right after we graduated, then constantly tried to one-up me by pushing the fact that they got employed sooner than me into my face. jokes on them; i'm working 40 hours a week and getting 100k a month while they have a lot of unpaid overtime and night shift differentials while they slave away in call centers. * whenever i opened up to people about my life story, people typically say ""pero pamilya mo parin sila"", ""hindi ka ba naawa sa mga kapatid mo?"", ""kahit ganyan ginagawa nila sayo, kausapin mo rin sila"". thanks for the unsolicited advice, but i genuinely do not feel safe with parents who tried to file a false kidnapping case on me. * palagi akong pinilit magsama sa mga party, outing, etc. may beses na hindi ako nagsama, pero tinawagan akong ""suplado"", ""masungit"", ""mataray"", ""mayabang"", ""matapobre"" (wtf), etc. * may isang beses na nagsumbong yung ex-friend ko sa magulang ko kung asan ako nakatira. ex-friend said this was an attempt for my parents to ""fix their relationship with me"". i had to stay in my s/o's house in the province, and i had to revoke my contract with my landlord at the time. i still feel bad for my landlord, but i found him a new tenant myself to make up for it. * palagi akong kinompara sa mga pinsan ko. kinompara din ako sa mga batchmate ko. they said ""buti nalang si person x ganyan, may kwenta sila. gayahin mo yan, wag kang maging walang kwenta."" * i was shamed for doing art commissions to earn money, especially my parents. they said ""kapag yan ginagawa mo, gugutom ka. dapat nagnursing, engineering, accounting, o law ka nalang"". i was also shamed for my other hobbies like photography, traveling, anime, learning japanese, theater (this one hurt; i applied to join the philippine educational theater association, but my parents sabotaged my application by stopping it from reaching the interviewers), etc. * the whole time i lived in the philippines... i felt like the system was against me. it tried to make me into someone i wasn't. it was forcing me to become someone who sacrificed everything for others, while not being given anything in return, and to base my worth as a person on my profession, my income, and how much ""support"" i'm giving to my family. thus comes the thought, what in the actual h\*ll is wrong with the philippines? if anyone is going through something similar to me, i hope my story can help you be confident about being yourself. it's not that you're wrong for being different, you're simply in the wrong place that doesn't accept you. you don't have to leave the country. find others going through the same thing you are, and distance yourself from the people that drag you down.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/16tzqab/managed_to_leave_the_country_and_thought_what_in/,27 09 2023

My thanksgiving dinner experience with a BBM family.,"so eto nga guys, nag-punta kami (me (f), my wife (f) my sister and her bf) reluctantly sa invitation ng ilocano-bbm tita na kapit-bahay namin. may pinag-samahan naman yung family kahit papano, before elections super ganda ng communication namin sa kanila kasi kapitbahay namin dito sa canada. saktong usapan lang, nag-dasal kami bago kumain. to be honest, ang ganda nung prayer. as an agnostic, na-appreciate ko naman siya. pero gagi, yung kapatid ko brining-up yung pag-unfriend ko sa tito ko na misogynistic bbm supporter din tapos sabi sakin bigla nung bbm na tita: ""kayo kasi maka-leni kayong lahat diba? dapat di na kayo nagpapa-niwala sa kwento kwento lang. dapat sa totoong news sources lang."" mind you, binigyan ko lang siya nuon ng heads-up na fake yung website source niya (halatang fake kasi no actual sources from credible organizations, news sites, people, also the ones she sent me usually walang https:// (unsecure-doesnt mean all with https:// are legit as well) tapos yung design nung buong site, parang cult na may agila, illuminati sht - web designer and dev ako) tapos kinimkim pala niya yun. di ko nalang tinuloy yung pag-rebut ko kasi yung wife ko natatakot na magalit ako. i was very polite about it kasi mas matanda siya sakin and i was just looking out for her. then na-bring up nanaman ng kapatid ko about yung recently nangyari kay leila de lima. gagi nagulat ako sabi ng panganay niyang babae, ""dapat pinatay na nila yun. tinuluyan na dapat sinaksak."" sabay silang pamilyang tumawa (aside sa bunso na awkward sa situation) i felt chills. paanong nakakapag-dasal ng ganun kaganda tapos without any hesitations, would wish harm on other people just like that. ps. sinabihan din nung bbm tita yung mom ko directly bakit ako nag-cocomment and nag-popost na kumakalaban sa views niya. tas sabi ni bbm tita ""isang post mo nalang eh sasampalin na kita."" sabay tawa. eto din isang kinagalit ko sila yung traditional toxis filipino family. lakas nilang i-body shame yung asawa ko sa harap ko? muntik na talaga nag-liparan ang mga lumpia. anyways, officially cut ties with them na. may bbm supporter akong mga kakilala pero not that extreme (madalas dahil lang kasi ilocano. &nbsp; &nbsp; (edit) just to answer some questions. &nbsp; > quote q1. why was politics bough up nung dinner? i did not want to talk about politics because i knew it was going to be a mess, pero my sister thought our casual arguments sa fb nuon nung tita is civil and casual. she thought wrong. she had no idea the tita was extremely pro-marcos. she tried to change the topic but we decided na umalis bago magka-gulo (because i get really unpleasant pag nasimulan ko nang magalit and isa yun sa puna ng wife ko sakin kaya ayaw ko siya lalo ma-stress) anywho, lesson learned sa kapatid ko lol &nbsp; >quote q2. di bako sumagot or stoop up for what i believe in? i tried. di sa pag-tanggol sa pagkatalo or sa binoto ko, pero sa misinformation na nagbblur sa totoo at hindi. ang sagot sakin ""naniniwala ka kasi sa fake news. dun ka sa totoong balita lang. wag sa kwento kwento sa facebook at tiktok."" can't argue with people who always things they're right. siya nag-banggit na kay leni kami nag-vote last election and my side of the family all nodded (said ""yes. syempre tita."") then she proceeded to complain about the philippines being poor right now and then overcompensating sa pag-puri kay bbm after niya magreklamo. lol also i don't ever want to stoop low para makipag-sampalan at murahan sa harap nung bunso nila (na awkwardly listening to her mom talk about marcos. i guess she's the ""odd"" one in the family.) &nbsp; >quote q3. but they body-shamed your wife? di ka pumatol? as mentioned i can become harsh pag galit ako. my wife doesn't like me when i'm at that point of anger kaya we just looked at each other and signaled na umalis na. although i told them my wife is building strength kasi nag-ddeadlift siya. di nila alam ata kung ano yun. tbh nung tumahimik ako, napansin nung bf ng sister ko and akala daw nila may gagawin ako. i'm honestly surprised i held it in like that. i'm quite proud of myself. charot &nbsp; >quote q4. important ba sila sa inyo? nung bago-bago palang kami sa canada isa yung tita na nagshashare ng food niya samin sa work, nag-lolook out for us and genuinely concerned if we were okay. kaya masakit din na this happened. &nbsp; >quote q5. anong nangyari sa fresh lumpia? binigyan kami ng pa-take home pero wala na gusto kumain. binalik ko yung plate nila kahapon pero di ko na kinausap. iniwan ko nalang sa pinto nila. &nbsp; &nbsp; >quote edit: clarified that not all websites with ""https://"" are legit din.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/y1fwdi/my_thanksgiving_dinner_experience_with_a_bbm/,11 10 2022
"Long Hair, Adik","so some crazy stuff just happened and i'm still pissed. lumabas ako kanina para mag-apply sa trabaho. syempre feeling inadequate, matagal tagal ding natambay dahil sa lockdown, psyching myself up, halos di ko na nga mangitian asawa ko sa nerbyos. pagdating sa site, they said i need to secure a good moral certificate from the barangay. so i went. dayo lang ako sa lugar na 'to, decided to settle here just last december in this ""city"" where my wife grew up. hindi ko naman nasettle agad yung papers ko kasi nga, nalockdown. nagrent kami ng asawa ko ng isang room, and we've been here for about 6 months. i explained this to the people in the brgy hall. as in katabi lang ng brgy hall yung nirerentahan naming kwarto. they said kuha daw ako ng gmc sa permanent address ko. i explained again, dayo lang po ako dito, at meron naman akong cedula registered with my present address, and local lang naman po yung aapplyan kong trabaho. dalawang beses ako bumalik para humingi ng reconsideration. so they ushered me to the brgy captain. and shit went downhill. convo went like this: ""sino ka ba? taga-saan ka? di naman kita kilala, paano kita bibigyan ng good moral?"" ""sir diyan lang po kami nagrerent, kina (name of landlord). bale 6 months na din po akong naninirahan dito, may cedula na din po ako."" ""talikod ka nga."" so i did. note, i am wearing my polo shirt and my nice baleno khaki pants and shoes. my hair is long, nakatali sa likod, waxed and combed neatly. ""oh nakatali pa buhok mo, respetuhin niyo naman ang opisina pag papasok kayo."" i kept quiet. he went on. ""may ganyan ba? mahabang buhok? adik ka ata eh. nagmamarijuana ka ata eh."" nakatitig lahat ng employees sa akin. i pulled down my mask as he pointed fingers at me. ""sir nakapolo at pants at sapatos naman po ako ah. di naman po ako nakatsinelas."" ""hindee, yang buhok mo! pumapasok kayo sa opisina ko ganyan itsura mo? baka may marijuana ka pa diyan?"" ""sir kahit ipadrugtest niyo pa ako."" ""eh bakit ganyan buhok mo?""

(at oo, nakakainggit kasi bukod sa di na niya dama ang covid19, super hot papi pa ang asawa niya.) unfortunately, i don't think i have that will. di ko kayang isuka ako ng pamilya ko, lalo pa ngayong alam kong di ko pa kayang tumayo on my own. kaya pilit ko na lang sinasarili yung sekswalidad ko kahit gusto ko nang aminin sa parents ko. another struggle din yung matindi kong craving for physical touch and intimacy. lahat ng ex ko, we can only do that kapag solo namin ang bahay nila/bahay namin, and that rarely happens. gustong-gusto ko ring maranasan yung may ka-holding hands ka in public or yung pupunta kayo sa amusement park, doing cutesy shits, and no one will bother you. o yung mahalikan ka kapag may fireworks display. o yung maisayaw ka kapag may nagpapatugtog ng sweet songs sa mga gathering like kasal. pero hindi e. i'm not thick-skinned enough to do that, and neither my exes. so, wala. we just keep it to ourselves. speaking of exes, ewan pero magnet din ako ng lalaking malibog lang, which freaking hurts kasi kahit ba mahilig din naman akong makipagtalik, i still date to look for a lifelong companion. pero wala. ang hirap. sometimes kapwa mo pa bakla/bisexual ang unang bigot na ma-e-encounter mo. i literally have a date who kept on saying he's straight kasi he never bottoms, so i ghosted him. sometimes, nakaka-feel ka ng intimacy sa sex friend mo, but you have to keep your feelings intact kasi hanggang libugan lang talaga ito. but my worst experience pa rin e yung may jowang babae at ginawa akong side bitch. i still get angry whenever i remember that, lalo pa noong sinabi niyang dapat daw magpasalamat akong siya pa ang nagyayaya sakin na mag-sex kami. i'm not a sex doll na parausan mo lang. i'm a human. i have feelings. you know, dream kong maging houseband doing a traditional wife role. lumaki kasi akong walang father figure so i wanna be a stay-at-home dad for my kids. besides, tamad din ako mag-work but i enjoy cleaning and cooking, so swak talaga sakin ang maging houseband. but i'm a guy living in an era na both parents have to work to support their family. i don't think magiging possible ang pangarap kong ito. sometimes, i wish i'm straight na lang. i guess less complicated ang buhay ko.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/my73nj/minsan_ang_hirap_maging_bakla/,25 04 2021

buhat na dyan, di mo kailangan gawin yan, basta may pambayad ka may gamot ako dito. hula ko hindi pampa regla ang kailangan mo.” “bumyahe pa yan mula bohol para makita ka.” sabi ni richard. “meron po akong sakit at kailangan ko ang tulong nyo.” “ano ang sakit mo?” at kinuwento nga ni manang avelina ang kanyang mga sintomas at nakinig naman si bathala. “pasensya ka na, pero wala akong maitutulong sa sakit mo. mga gamot na mabibigay ko ay pantulong lang sa kirot pero di ito mapapahaba ang buhay mo.” “naniniwala pa po ako sa inyong kapangyarihan. baka pwede nyo pong gamitin ang kapangyarihan nyo sa akin.” natawa si bathala. “nakikita mo ba ako? tatlong araw na akong di nakakaligo at nagbabantay na lang ako ng tindahan na ito. dito ako natutulog dahil wala akong bahay. alam mo kung bakit ko piniling pumwesto dito sa simbahan ng quiapo? para maramdaman ko man lang na ako ang sinasamba ng mga tao pero hindi ako ang sinasamba nila kaya’t wala na akong kapangyarihan. ang mangilan-ngilan na kapangyarihan ko sa mga mangigilan na bumubulong ng pangalan ko sa kanilang dasal ay binubuhos ko sa mga gamot na to.” “alam mo sinasamba ng mga tao ngayon? pera. wala din ako nyan. mukha bang malakas ang bentahan ng pwesto ko? pero bebentahan kita ng gamot dahil di pa din ako kumakain ng pang gabi. itong isang bote na to, 350 na lang. inumin mo to isang kutsara sa umaga at isa sa gabi para sa sakit. pero ulitin ko, di ka nito mapapagaling.” kumuha ng pera si manang avelina sa kanyang pitaka at ibinayad kay bathala. “salamat! bumalik ka, hija! at kung maari, babalik na ako sa tulog ko. richard, daan ka ulit dito minsan. kwentuhan tayo.” “salamat pa rin po, dakilang bathala.” at naglakad na pabalik patungo sa hotel ang dalawa. “ayoko man isipin at ayokong maniwala, pero pera na nga yata ang kapangyarihan ngayon. yun na din yata ang sagot sa sakit ko.” sabi ni lina habang naglalakad pabalik. “at least kung may pera ako may pang ospital ako.” “kung di ka din matutulungan ni bathala at pera din lang pala sagot sa problema mo baka hindi si bathala ang pinuntahan natin.” “sino?” “si pilandok” hope to be continued",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/vy5jhx/short_tagalog_story_i_hope_you_like_it/,13 07 2022

"Hi, gusto ko lang sana mag bukas loob sa inyo haha TW: INCLUDES SUICIDE","hello wala kasi akong mahanap na lugar kung saang lugar ako pwedeng mag-open up tungkol sa mental health ko. sana okay lang sa inyo na dito ako maglabas ng lakas ng loob na sabihin ito, since open minded naman karamihan ng mga nandito sa community na ito. nahihiya akong ipakilala sarili ko, so brief intro na lang. 19 years old nako, upcoming 20 ngayong april, technically di pa ako college kasi nakahinto ako ngayon dahil wala akong pambayad para makapagenroll. ayun lang naman. may sakit akong depression and anxiety attack, na diagnose na ako noong 2019, pero hindi ako nagkaroon ng proper therapy dahil hindi kaya ng budget ng pamilya ko. pinainom naman ako ng gamot ng doktor para hindi ako mag-panic attack ulit. tapos ng tatlong buwan hinintuan ko na yung paginom ng gamot dahil pakiramdam ko okay nako. pumatak si 2020, ang daming nangyari. nagsteam ng abo ang taal, namatay si kobe bryant at ang anak niyang si gigi, tapos dumating ang pandemic kaya nag cancel ang mga klase noong mga march. dahil sa sobrang daming negatibong nangyayari sa kapaligiran, unti-unti na namang bumabalik yung sakit ko. pero at this point kinakaya ko naman siyang i-endure. ayun lang, akala ko kaya ko pang labanan. natitiis ko pang magpakalakas ng loob noong quarantine era eh. ngunit noong august 2020, doon na ako sumuko. nung time na yun nag-pile up talaga lahat ng problema ko, nawalan ng trabaho tatay ko, hindi ako nakapag-enroll sa la salle taft dahil hindi kaya ng budget namin yung enrollment, sobrang pressured ako at punong-puno ng inggit dahil mga kaibigan ko nakakapag-aral na, ako lang hindi. mas lumala anxiety attack ko dahil doon, to the point na akala ko mamamatay ako dahil hindi ako makahinga. kaya nung time na yun, nagshutdown ako physically and mentally kasi di ko na talaga alam kung anong gagawin ko. gusto kong magpadoktor, pero takot na takot akong lumabas ng bahay. kaya alternatibong paraan na muna ginawa ko---at yun ay magpakabusy muna like workout, mag drawing o painting, sayaw. nagwoworkout naman yung pagwoworkout, drawing o painting, at tsaka sayaw sakin. nakarelieve siya ng sakit ko. hangga't sa nawalan na naman yung motibasyon kong kumilos. bumalik yung panic attack ko, kasi nung mga time na yun sobrang sama ng mga na sa balita, palpak pa yung gobyerno, at ang daming taong namamatay o pinapatay ng mga pulis. bilang isang nialalang na malakas ang empathy trait, sobrang naapektuhan ako, at galit na galit sa mga walang hiyang opisyal na kinakawawa ang mamamayan. dahil doon hindi na naman kinaya ng mental health ko, sobrang nakakahawa talaga sakin yung mga ganong negative na balita. high blood pa naman ako, kaya ang dali kong manghina. mula noon, palala na ng palala yung panic attack ko. halos dalawa sa tatlong beses ako atakihin sa isang linggo. nararanasan ko ito hanggang ngayon. sobrang lungkot ko kasi hindi ako gumagaling. gustong-gusto ko na talagang magpakamatay kasi ayoko na ng mga nangyayari sa paligid ko, ayoko nang mahirapan, at lalong ayoko na talaga sa inutil nating presidente! araw-araw akong nagcocontemplate at naiisip na parang mas masaya kung na sa kabilang mundo na ako. kapag kasi nagkakaroon ako ng panic attack nanghihina ako, hirap na hirap akong huminga, at tsaka nagbablackout na ako. sa totoo lang takot akong magpakamatay, kasi ayoko munang iiwan pamilya ko. naaawa na rin kasi ako sa kanila na ang dami rin nilang pinagdadaanan dahil sakin. naiisip ko rin kasi ayoko munang mamatay dahil gusto kong suklian sila mama at papa na makita nila akong successful. pero nahihirapan na rin kasi ako mentally. gusto ko nang magpatherapy, gusto ko nang magpagamot ulit, pero nahihiya na ako kina mama at papa dahil ayoko nang maging pabigat pa sa kanila. ang mga kaibigan ko naman, ayoko rin na muna silang abalahin pa sa acads nila dahil alam kong stress na stress na rin sila sa online classes. gusto ko na talagang gumaling ako. pasensya na kung sobrang haba nitong post ko, at ang dami kong kinwento sa inyo. sana maunawaan ninyo yung nararamdaman ko ngayon. gusto ko ring makalipas dito, at gusto ko ring malipasan natin itong pandemya at gusto ko na rin mapatalsik si duterte na pabigat sa mental health ko. kung may-advice or message po kayo sa akin maaappreciate ko po yun. kung nakaabot ka dito sa dulo, congrats sayo. gusto ko lang rin sabihin sa inyo na kamustahin niyo yung mga kaibigan niyong may pinagdadaanan na ka tulad ko. nahihirapan rin silang mag-open up kaya lapitan niyo na rin sila. pasensya na ulit kung mahaba yung post, at salamat ng marami.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/mlcfqu/hi_gusto_ko_lang_sana_mag_bukas_loob_sa_inyo_haha/,6 04 2021
Ang hirap maging mahirap,"hi everyone! ito yung pinaka unang beses ko mag post sa reddit and unfortunately dahil pa sa sakit. (please bear with me). during college around 2014-2018 may nararamdaman na ako na pananakit sa sikmura pero sobrang hina or hindi ganon ka grabe then last week kumirot sya ng sobra so nag decide ako magpa er sa private hospital (since may hmo naman ako) pero hindi nila ako tinaggap dahil nung pagpunta ko ay nawala naman yung sakit so tolerable naman daw so nirefer nila ako sa outpatient then after ng mga procedures (labs), so ayun nga may gallstones ako. then na er ulit ako this week dahil hindi ko na kinaya yung aakit and need ko daw ng surgery tumanggi ako dahil baka hindi covered ng hmo ko (maxicare, 150k). bumalik ako sa unang hospital na pinuntahan ko so doon sa akin na explain yung surgery na gagawin which is yung ""open"" or ""laparoscopic"" at ang quotation is around 250k-350k depende pa kung walang ibang findings na makita understandable kasi private yung hospital. nag try ako pumunta sa mercado general hospital inc. sa compound ng pgh for second opinion then sabi sa akin ay aabutin ng around 75k-85k minus yung sa philhealth na around 15k daw so malaki pa din. working naman ako pero wala akong ipon dahil mahirap yung kalagayan namin at nag sisimula pa lang kami. ako lang din mag isa nag aasikaso ng lahat. kumakapit na lang ako sa kahit anong maliit na pag asa na nakikita ko, ayoko mapagod, ayaw ko mawalan ng pag asa pero bakit naman ganito. ang lala na ng anxiety ko na hindi ako makapag isip ng matino, ang daming tumatakbo sa isip ko gusto ko i rant isa isa pero baka ma bored lang kayo. so need ko po ng help/advise: 1. saang hospital may ganoon na procedure yung free or kung hindi man is yung covered ng hmo na hindi lalagpas sa 100k? 2. if ever saan po pwede manghingi ng cash assistance? at ano need na paper since ultrasound and medical certificate lang po ang meron ako. 3. or if may mga alam po kayo na pwede gawin para makapag undergo ng surgery na hindi need mag labas ng sobrang laking pera or mas better kung wala po thank you in advance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/13kauvf/ang_hirap_maging_mahirap/,17 05 2023

Excluded,"ang hirap din pala na lumaki sa pamilya na hinahayaan ka lang. nung elementary ako nag aaral lang talaga or ginugusto ko lang masama sa honor dahil gusto ng nanay ko yun. sinasabi lang ng nanay ko na okay lang daw kahit hindi pero yung totoo sobrang sumasama loob nya pag bumababa grades ko. samin kasing mag kakapatid ako lang yung honor student simula elementary. naaalala ko sumasali akong mga extra curricular kasi gusto ng nanay ko yun. basta gusto nya yung ginagawa ko di ko kailangan mag sabi. naalala ko nun gusto kong sumali sa music club kasi nag aaral silang tumugtog ng mga instruments di lang pag kanta. wala naman akong talent sa pag kanta kaya instruments lang gusto ko, bata palang ako gusto kong tumugtog. sabi ko pa nun pag nag 1st ako piano yung gift nila. sabi nila oo. college nako yung piano ko wala padin hahahaha. hinahayaan nila kong gawin yung mga gusto nilang ipagawa sakin pero yung gusto ko di ko magawa. everytime na may competition ako pag uwi ko galing school hindi nila ko pinagagawa ng gawaing bahay dun lang ako sa kwarto mag review lang daw ako. lagi yun, di nila alam pag nasa kwarto ako umiiyak lang ako madalas kasi sa school buong araw nag rereview lang ako pag uwi ganon ulit. sa isip isip ko di nyo bako iask if kamusta ko, okay ba ko. kamusta yung pag rereview ko. pinaka masakit pa tuwing may competition ako sasabihin ko lang yung araw kailan then bibigyan lang nila kong allowance yun na yun. wala bang ibang support akong makukuha. di nila ko sinasamahan yung mga kasama ko may parents, ako sagot ko lang may work po. laging teacher kasama ko tapos uuwi ako di nila ko tatanungin anong nangyari sa laban. no one knows if i win or not. then nagugulat sila pag nag congrats mga teacher ko sa kanila dahil nanalo ko sa competion. high school nag aral akong tumugtog ng guitar pero pinigilan din nila. paulit ulit lang pag top ako sa class wala akong maririnig sa kanila pag bumaba yung grades nagagalit sila. di nila nalalaman anong nangyayari sakin. gusto kong mag aral ng instrument at mag paint di ko magawa kasi di nila ko isusupport dun. wala akong masabihan nahihirapan na ko mag aral. wala akong masabihan na nagkaka anxiety and panic attack ako. wala silang alam sakin at hindi nila gustong alamin yun. hinahayaan lang nila ko na parang hangin. ang hirap pala, naiingit sakin mga kapatid ko kasi daw nagagawa ko daw yung gusto ko ha ha ha. samantalang sila need padaw nila mag paalam at magsabi kay nanay. sila nga tong may emotional support lagi. lagi silang kinakausap ni nanay para alamin anong nararamdaman nila. last year mag isa kong nakatira sa bahay namin. i celebrate my birthday on my own. no one checks me. i got sick, walang naka alam. buti pa yung mga tita, tito and pinsan ko sinisilip ako sa bahay at kinakamusta kasi takot na baka mapano ako wala akong kasama. pero mga kapatid nung nasa ibang bansa kasama yung tita ko at nag work sa ibang lugar every day kinakamusta. tapos pag may sakit sila tinatawagan ako ng parents ko para alagaan sila pero ako, ako pa yung bumibili ng gamot ko kahit nilalagnat na ko. tatawag yung parents ko sakin para kamustahin mga kapatid ko. pangalawa ako sa pinaka bata samin pero need ko alagaan yung 4 kong kapatid. never sa bahay ko na natanong nila ko kung kamusta ko. kahit iyun lang hindi ko natanggap. sa mata ng ibang tao ang perfect kong anak. may anak kang achiever at masunurin pero di nila alam na ginagawa ko lang yung kasi wala akong worth sa pamilya namin. parang throphy pinagmamalaki sa ibang tao pero hindi naman pinapansin pag di pinansin ng iba. yung tingin nila sakin independent kasi kayang ko gawin yung mga bagay ng walang tulong ng iba pero di nila alam feeling ko kasi left out ako and excluded ako sa family kaya ginagawa ko yun. wala akong kakampi, walang sumusuporta skain ako lang. sinong aasahan ko ako lang hindi. ang hirap.. napapa isip ko kasalan ko ba kaya rin ako nagkaganto?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/11yhgvx/excluded/,22 03 2023

Legal ba ang pet euthanasia dito? (Isabela province),"na parvo yung 2-month-old puppy ko. noong una palang na nagpakita siya ng signs ng pananamlay at pagsusuka, dinala na namin agad sa vet. once naconfirm na positive siya sa parvo naconfine naman siya agad pero mabilis na nagdeteriorate yung health niya. nung andun na siya sa clinic, nagi-start na syang magpoops ng dugo. tinanong ko na agad yung vet niya kung anong pwedeng maging option in case mag worsen yung kalagayan niya. kasi tinitignan ko yung liit nyan yun, iniimagine ko palang yung pagdadaanan niya sobrang naiiyak na ako. ngayon inaaffirm nila ako na kakayanin niya naman, kaya nagka hope naman ako na magiimprove yung kalagayan niya. basta i-observe lang daw. hindi naman sa pagiging pessimistic, pero gusto ko lang ding marinig yung isang possibility kahit sobrang sakit niyang isipin. gustong gusto ko syang gumaling i swear. pero kung ang ibig sabihin non e ioobserve siya ng ilang days para tignan kung magworkout yung gamutan niya. titignan kung maka survive siya o hindi. and in case man na makasurvive siya, hindi pa guaranteed na magkakaroon siya ng normal life after parvo. triny kong i brought up ko yung euthanasia, kung legal ba, kung pwede bang maging option. pero parang iniiwasan nilang sagutin. never nila akong binigyan ng exact na sagot. basta i-observe lang at kasi baka naman makasurvive siya. ngayon inoobserve namin si puppy. nakaswero parin siya at nagagamot pero parang hindi siya nagwowork. inoobserve nalang namin kung paano siya mag suffer ng unti-unti na syang nanghihina. constant na yung pagsusuka, pagtatae ng dugo, pag ihi niya. sobrang awang-awa na ako sa kanya. parang inaantay nalang namin na kusa siyang malagutan ng hininga. sobrang traumatizing at heartbreaking. i feel so helpless. gustong-gusto kong i-ease na yung nararamdaman niya kaso 'di ko naman alam kung papaano.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/16jghgd/legal_ba_ang_pet_euthanasia_dito_isabela_province/,15 09 2023

Tried my luck to apply in a Government Department and this is what I observed,"good day pinas , share ko lang yung journey ko sa pag apply sa contract service job na available sa di ko na papangalanan na department hahah, basta under govt. sinusbukan ko kasi ang best ko para magamit man lang tong cs eligibility (prof) ko. and btw my average is 80.3 hahaha first taker and i passed it so i think that is my sign from god na gamitin yung biyaya na bigay nya . so upon applying this department, short listed agad ang lolo mo. and then akala ko may pa pre-qualifying examination sila , kaso for plantilla position lang daw yung pqe(pre-qualifying examination) nila . so medyo nakahinga ako kasi interview nalang gagawin and i know very formal ang magaganap na recruitment at panel interview ang magaganap and totoo nga ang hinala ko . tatlong regional director ang nandoon and other officers like their secratary and hr staffs. and during my interview i think i nailed it naman and may na impress din sakin since parang prepared ako and medyo fluent na rin sa english eme di nila alam ilang beses na ako naging trainee ng bpo . hanggang trainee lang kasi inaayawan ko din sa huli and hindi ko naitutuloy due to conflict of schedules and certain situations. balik tayo sa interview meron lang dalawang interviewer yung parang nakitaan ako ng red flag , isa dun is yung sagot ko daw na parang hindi ako tatangap ng trabaho na hindi computer related based sa mga answer ko. and i think wala naman akong sinabi para isipin nya yun shinowcase ko lang yung pagiging passionate ko sa computer related job and it industry and that answer is also connected sa isa pang interviewer na parang red flag din yung tingin nya sakin since bakit daw ako nag resign sa recent job ko which is financial company. and sagot ko hindi ko feel yung job since hindi aligned sa degree ko at sa forte ko . which is it industry nga or kahit any computer related task, dun kasi sa recent job ko is may computer naman hahah kaso more on financial service and sales and hindi ko naman ginusto yun , grinab ko lang kasi wala pa akong mapapasukan noon because i'm also a fresh grad last year. and ayun parang feel ko red flag sa kanila yung pag resigned ko. sabi pa ng isang regional director is parang hindi para sakin yung job since ang superior daw ng laman ng pds ko hahaha (may mga trainings na kasi more on webinars lang pero aligned sa mga govertment job) sinadya ko talang kumuha ng mga online trainings for this situation kaso parang yun din yung isa sa mga nag tulak sa kanila na hindi ako tanggapin since superior nga daw like overqualifed. and after 2 weeks ayun nakatanggap ako ng letter of regret na hindi ako nakuha. sakit lang sa loob kasi nag prepare talaga ako and alam ko parang konti nalang tatangapin na nila ako. i believe naman sa kasabihan na "" not because god doesn't grant what you are wishing and praying for doesn't mean he doesn't hear you; sometimes god answers you yes, sometimes he tells you to wait, and other times he says i will exceed your expectations and give you a better one. "". yan yung kinakapitan ko na salita ng diyos ngayon kaso ansakit sa feelings talaga hahaha. better luck next time sa mag papa exam at mag papainterview ulit sakin haha. just want to hear your thoughts and advice on my story. thats all. thank you and magandang gabi bayan! &#x200b; &#x200b; ps: halos 30+ kami na nainterview noon pero sa job role na pinasukan ko 6 or 7 kami pss: as expected may mga insider or mga nag tratrabaho na sa department ang nag apply ulit . haays hahah",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/15w8z9i/tried_my_luck_to_apply_in_a_government_department/,20 08 2023
Rapid test igM positive,"i was hired for work and i was required to do a rapid test before starting, turned out that i was igm weak positive. i felt nothing. all i remember was i had fever, colds and sore throat a month ago and it went off already. sa ngayon, wala na. wala akong sakit. i was shocked and emotional as soon as i saw the results. i only told a trusted friend and my parents. i kept crying because i think, ""paano nalang mga kapatid kong katabi kong matulog,"" ""paano nalang yung mga nakasama ko."" i was so worried. i did what i could — i practiced social distancing, wore my face mask and face shield everywhere i go, and i constantly put alcohol on my hands. as soon as i get home, i change clothes and wash myself plus i drink vitamin c at night before sleeping. i did what i could, but where did i go wrong? the doctor advised that i should monitor symptoms and i am required to do a 2-week home isolation. saw articles that there were really false positives in antibody tests. my friend told me that i should take this in a positive manner since i can see that my immune system is working and is fighting against infection. pero nakakatrauma talaga yung positive rapid test result. eto ako ngayon, naka self-quarantine. wala paring sakit. pero psychologically traumatized.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/i6kpnz/rapid_test_igm_positive/,9 08 2020
"Take any job until you find yout dream job, Pride won't buy you bread.","""take any job until you find you dream job, pride won't buy you bread."" — i just wanna share this. take the lesson you think you learn. i wrote this wholeheartedly. when i was studying, my family was not well off. hindi ko afford bumili ng bagay na gusto ko, mahirap lang kasi kami. i graduated highschool and it's time for college— alam kong hindi afford ng magulang ko na paaralin ako. so nag start ako as workinh student, nag apply ako sa jollibee as service crew. naalala ko na one time nakita ako doon ng mga kaklase ko ng highschool na hindi ko naman kaibigan at pinag tatawanan nila ko. ( sabi ko sa isip ko, wow. ang baba ng tingin nila sa service crew?) all around ako sa jb, taga hugas , taga map, taga ligpit, taga serve ng order — gusto ko maging cashier pero dahil baguhan ako, hindi pwede. dun ko din na experience ang salbahing katrabaho. fast forward, naging awake ako sa hirap ng buhay at hirap kumita. habang nag aaral nag trtrabaho ako. nakakapagod, nakakaiyak — may time na gusto ko na mag suicide. medical course ang inaaral ko noon, sobrang stressful. 10 hrs sa isang major subject tapos kinabukasan trabaho. hindi ko alam kung paano ko kinakaya. may time na habang nag tratrabaho bigla na lang akong lumuluha. na over come ko yun, nag trabaho ako sa mcdonald's bilang crew, sa city hall bilang assistant, lahat ng pwedeng diskarte habang nag aaral. ar'yan ang pangkukutsa ng kakilala dahil di naman nila alam ang sitwasyon o dahilan bakit mo ginagawa iyon. but i kept going. pa graduate na sana ako, nasa 4th na ako ng kolehiyo. ngunit may hindi magandang nangyari. kinailangan ko huminto at nag apply ako sa bpo/call centers. (sabi ng ilan na walang alam ay bagsakan ng mga walang tinapos, which is a stereotype dahil hindi totoo. hindi ka makakapasok sa bpo kung wala kang skills at utak.) kinailangan ko suportahan ang pamilya ko at kumita ng mas malaking pera dahil nagkasakit noon ang lola ko. sa makatuwid, mula ng mag umpisa akong magtrabaho, hindi ko na natapos ang kurso ko. (back story: sa college, binubully ako ng professor dahil loner ako, pano lahat ng kaibigan ko noon ay nagibang kurso na at hindi kinaya ang medical course) so masasabi ko nung panahon na ito, nasa kasagsagan ako ng depression. ito talaga ang panahon na umiiyak ako gabi gabi sa sakit ng mga nararamdaman ko sa buhay. i was a mess. 3 years later — yung mga kaibigan at ilang kaklase ko na naka tapos ng kolehiyo, wala silang trabaho. ""hard work pays off"". hindi ko akalain na magiging itaas akk. kung noon na ako ang inuutusan, ako na ang nag uutos. laking pasasalamat ko sa panginoon sa mga nangyari sa buhay ko. kasalukuyan akong nag tr'trabaho bilang manager ng isang kilalang center sa pinas. may ilang beses na nag mensahe sakin ang ilan kong naging kaklase noon, na binully at tinawanan ako , nagpapa tulong silang makapasok. — tinulungan ko naman sila kaya lang hindi kaya. hindi nila maipasa ang exam para makapag trabaho sa center. bakit kaya? nakatapos naman sila at ang yayabang nila noon? ( nakarma ba sila dahil sa pambubully nila sakin at pangmamata nila sa kapwa? ) upang lumawak pa ang aking kaalaman, habang nagtratrabaho pa din, nag aaral ng kursong related sa business, online nga lang pero sa isang unibersidad na. mga bagay na hindi ko kaya bilin noon, ngayon na kaya ko na, mga lugar na hindi ko kaya puntahan noon, ngayon napupuntahan ko na. ngunit nandun pa din ang pakiramdam na kailangan may ma accomplish ako, hindi para sa iba kundi para sa sarili ko. na kahit nasa itaas na ako, hindi ako titigil matuto, hindi ko itetenga ang aking sarili. saludo ako sa lahat ng breadwinners na madaming sinakrepisyo para lang sa pamilya nila. you win this life. life is too short to have regrets, live in the present moment and do your best with this one life given to you. maraming salamat sa pagbabasa.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/117rkjo/take_any_job_until_you_find_yout_dream_job_pride/,21 02 2023

Mahirap mamuhay sa panahon ngayon.,"almost 2 months mula nang simulan ang ecq, madami ako narealize at madami akong naexperience na bago sa akin. 1. kapag malayo ka sa kusina, di mo matitikman ang bagong lutong pagkain. - dito sa lugar namin, malapit nang maging literal yang mga sinabi ko. biruin mong halos labo labo ang mga taong kasama sa sap ng gobyerno para sa krisis. kapag nagreklamo ka naman, ang sasabihin sayo: ""ilista ka na lang namin para walang gulo"". ang gusto namin patas na pagpili hindi yung ililista mo kami dahil lang nagreklamo kami na bakit yang mayaman na yan, tatanggap ng 8k, tig isa pa sila ng asawa niya. paunahan talaga ang labanan sa kung sino ang makakasali sa sap. bibigyan ka ng form, may sulat na. ready na. yung ibang nakasulat pa, pekeng impormasyon pa. nakatanggap ba pamilya ko? hindi. una dahil may pensyon daw ang nanay ko. oo totoo naman, 1500 kada buwan. pangalawa dahil ang tatay ko nasa abroad. oo totoo din naman, kaso 2 buwan ng walang sahod. pangatlo ay may anak na propesyonal. oo totoo din yun, kaso no work no pay, 2 buwan na din. lehitimo naman mga rason nila ang problema lang, di sila masyadong nagtanong. ay mali, di sila nagtanong. 2. gagawin mo ang lahat pag desperado ka na. - ultimo yung online games na nagcacashout ng sentimo sa paypal, kahit gaano katagal ipunin, papatusin mo makatulong ka lang sa pamilya mo. pati na rin ang... wag na pala. masyadong pribado. 3. mahirap mamatayan, lalo na kung di dahil sa covid19. - naubos lahat lahat ng saving ng pamilya ko, pati ng kamag - anak ko, mapalibing lang lolo ko. ayaw kasi ng nanay at mga kapatid niya na sunugin ang tatay nila at gawing abo. ginawa namin ang lahat, wag lang talaga siya icremate, kahit na pekein namin ang cause of death niya, which is sobrang sakit sa amin. may sakit na matagal na sa baga ang lolo ko. p.s.: di ko po sinasabi na madaling mamatayan dahil sa covid19. masakit at mahirap din yun, pero sa tingin ko yung nangyari sa akin ang mas mahirap. 4. diskriminasyon sa namatayan. - nilayuan kami ng ibang mga kaptibahay nun nalaman nilang namatay lolo ko. ang problema? ni hindi naman namin kasama lolo namin nung namatay siya. nasa bulacan kami, nasa antipolo ang lolo ko. and yet, it still happened. pinagchichismisan na madumi kami at infected ng covid19. hirap pala mapagchismisan, nagiging sikat ka sa maling rason. alam niyo, nagkamali ako ng binotong presidente. tanga ko nung bumoto ako. kaya humihingi ako ng tawad sa inyong lahat, dahil isa ako sa dahilan, kung bakit ganito ang sitwasyon nating lahat ngayon. god bless us. ingat kayo.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/gg630r/mahirap_mamuhay_sa_panahon_ngayon/,9 05 2020

Bukas na liham ng lungkot mula sa anak ni Loren Legarda (ni Lorenzo Legarda Leviste),"sinulat ko ito ilang linggo matapos malaman na ang aking nanay, si loren legarda, ay tumatakbong senador sa partidong pinangungunahan ng isang marcos at ng isang duterte. ineendorso niya ang mga pasista. ilang linggo na akong umiiyak, sumisigaw hanggang sa sumuka ng dugo. hindi ko maintindihan ang desisyon niya, walang konsensya, walang kapatawaran. sa nakaraang buwan, gumuho ang buong buhay ko. mas malala pa ito sa bangungot. hindi ako makapaniwala, hindi ko matatanggap. ilang linggo na akong paralisado ng sakit. pero, wala akong ibang magagawa kung hindi ideklara na nuknukan akong nasusulasok sa aking ina at sa kanyang mga naging desisyon. nakakapanghina at parang gusto ko na lang mamatay. kailangang malaman ng lahat na nawala na kay loren legarda ang anak niyang ito habambuhay. hayaan ninyo siyang mamula sa kahihiyan. wag ninyong hayaang makalimutan niya ito. katulad ng sabi ng isang matalinong babae: hindi ko na siya kilala. kinailangan ang isang post ni ariana grande, kung saan kumakanta ng break free ang napakaraming tao sa rali, para kay leni, upang maalala ko na may eleksyon na paparating. hindi ako naka-base sa pilipinas simula noong edad-18; hindi na rin nakabisita nang dalawang dekada, hindi na rin nagkasama ng aking nanay nang ganoon din kahaba, at hindi ko na alam kung sinu-sino mismo ang mga tumatakbo. subalit nasaksihan ko sa nakaraang anim na taon ang sindak, pagkamuhi, takot. ang pagkawalang-pakialam ko ay isang pribilehiyo, na nakondisyon ng trauma sa kinalakihang bansa na kinikilala kong parating maysakit, at na-impeksyon ng amnesia sa kasaysayan at pagkakaila sa katotohanan. hanggang humantong na nga tayo dito. hindi ako papayag na maging normal na ang pamahalaang pasistang magnanakaw, ang mga kasinungalingan bilang ‘alternate truth,’ ang kawawang kasaysayan ng bansa na sinusulat ngayon bilang pantasya. ehemplo ang nanay ko sa kung paano ang pasismo ay kumakapit, at maging katanggap-tanggap, gawing normal, i-facilitate, i-giya nang basta na lamang. kailangan ninyong malaman na wala siyang ideya tungkol sa todong bigat at kabuktutan ng ginagawa niya. “so, nasa ticket nila ako. pasista na ba ako n’un?” tanong niya, nang may mapangutya at clueless. nakakakilabot. ang babaeng ito ay nasaksihan ang martial law; isa siyang journalist na nagturo sa akin na pahalagahan ang katotohanan at hustisya. ganito na sila ka-suklam-suklam, ka-walang-utak, at katatatapang ng apog ngayon. wala na silang ideya sa kung ano ang pinagagawa nila, at sa deka-dekadang karahasan at dalamhati na ilalarga na naman. para sa kanya, isa na naman itong election year lang, hinog para sa mga mga naglalaway at oportunista muli lamang. walang paghihinuha na ang isa na namang marcos ay kikitil muli sa pilipinas. *the end of history,* ang hangganan ng kasaysayan. pinanganak ako noong dekada ‘90, nasa anino ng mga dekada ng kabuktutan, paniniil, at korapsyon ng mga marcos. hindi talaga ako makapaniwala kung paano napagtakpan ang mga krimen nila pagdating ngayon. pakiramdam ko at hinila na lang bigla ang carpet na kinatatayuan ko. ang litanya ng mga krimen na ginawa ng mga marcos ay hindi na dapat pagtalunan. ang mga kabuktutan ay known fact na, pawang katotohanan. para sabihin at ulitin pa nga ito dito ay absurd at katawa-tawa na. kung i-de-deny mo pa ang mga katotohanang ito, katumbas na iyon sa pagdeklara mo sa sarili bilang kalaban ng hustisya; ng mga libu-libong buhay at pamilya na winasak ng mga marcos at duterte; ng milyun-milyong lumalaban sa frontline para pigilan sila. ang nanay ko, si loren legarda, ay dinuduruan silang lahat sa mukha. may isang indianong makata at aktibista na si aamir aziz, nilamon din siya ng kasamaan ng pasismo. sabi niya: “lahat ay matatandaan.” iniisip kong dapat markahan hindi lang ang mga krimen na ginawa ng mga nasa kapangyarihan. kasama dapat sa tandaan ang mga nagluklok sa kanila sa kapangyarihan. markahan natin ang mga kakilalang bumoboto sa baluktot, wag nating kalimutan ang mga pangalan nila. tandaan na nagdeklara sila ng pagpayag sa mga ginagong bersyon ng kasaysayan, nang walang hiya-hiya, katatapang ng apog, at nakaugat lahat sa kabuktutan. alam nila kung para saan ang boto nila—pabor sa malawakang patayan, malawakang nakawan, pagkitil sa demokrasya, ang panarantado sa kasaysayan—desperado silang gawin lahat yan. kapag umagos na ang dugo sa lansangan, huwag nating hayaang kalimutan nila na may dugo rin sa kanilang mga kamay, maalab at pulang-pula. ipaalala natin sa kanila araw-araw. kagagawan na rin nila ang mga krimen. panagutin sila sa mga krimeng ito. kailangang akuin nila. salagin nila ang mga ‘yan. lubos ang aking lungkot. tangina ang aking ina sa pagsulsol. ang mga krimen nila ay mga krimen na niya. subukan niyang lusutan ang mga ‘yan. ﻿\[si lorenzo legarda leviste ay anak ni loren legarda\] ﻿\[decided to translate and post here for accessibility. no copyright infringement intended. will remove this post when called for by publisher or author\].",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ujbjgv/bukas_na_liham_ng_lungkot_mula_sa_anak_ni_loren/,6 05 2022

Bakit ginawang kontrabida ang hindi bakunado?,"eto ha. mula’t sapul hindi naman binalak ni duterte na bakunahan lahat ng pilipino laban sa pandemya. 70% lang ng populasyon ang target na bakunahan. nasa pangatlong taon na tayo ng hawahan ay milyones pa din ang walang bakuna. pansinin ang mga lugar ng bakunahan at santambak pa din ang nakapila. patuloy na may umuuwi dahil naubusan ng slot. bakit ginagawang kontrabida ang hindi nabakunahan? ang ipinapangako lang ng bakuna ay maiwasan na maging grabe ang covid mo o mamatay ka sakaling tamaan. hindi garantiya ang bakuna na hindi ka mahahawa ng covid. may bakuna ka man o wala maaari kang mahawa, at makahawa. nabakunahan ka man o hindi panganib kayo pareho sa ibang tao kapag nagka-covid kayo. bakit ginagawang kontrabida ang hindi nabakunahan? kung nabakunahan ka na, malaki ang tsansa na mild lang o asymptomatic kapag tinamaan ka. ibig sabihin hindi halata na may sakit ka at makakahawa ka ng iba dahil wala naman testing na gagawin dahil wala ka ngang sintomas. ibig sabihin mas nakakatakot kang lumabas at sumakay sa bus. e bakit ginagawang kontrabida ang hindi nabakunahan? dejado ang hindi nabakunahan dahil mas malaki ang tsansa na grabe ang maging lagay niya pero kapag nagka-covid at gumaling ang hindi nabakunahan, ang natural immunity niya ay nagbibigay ng mas matatag at mas matagal na proteksyon kesa sa prevention na binibigay ng bakuna. pansinin na ang mga nabakunahan ang madalas may re-infection. bakit ginagawang kontrabida ang hindi nabakunahan? hindi ang walang bakuna ang kontrabida. alalahanin ang banta na aakyatin daw nung matanda at sa gabi gagawin. ang vacination card ay parang cedula noong panahon nila andres bonifacio, ginagamit para tapakan ang mga indio. parang nakakarining ako na merong sumisigaw pero pabulong: sunugin ang makabagong cedula! sugurin ang matanda na nasa kulambo! /s ang huling dalawang talata.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/s51dp5/bakit_ginawang_kontrabida_ang_hindi_bakunado/,16 01 2022

I wish people will stop adopting kids for the sake of magkaroon ng anak.,"ganito kasi, mga lods. kanina during breakfast, my dad told us na his older sister will officially be disowning her adopted son. well, di naman na minor yun. he's turning 20 this year. my aunt's reason is masyado na raw matigas ang ulo at hindi na makontrol. my dad is with her. sabi pa nga niya, walang utang na loob yung cousin ko lalo pa di naman nga raw namin kadugo pero pinalaki pa rin ni tita. pero iba ang nakikita ko e. my cousin was neglected. sure, pinakain siya at pinag-aral, but he never really had a parent figure. pinapabayaan lang maggala kasi masyadong busy ang parents niya. on top of that, our other cousins dislike him for the obvious reason he's adopted. lagi siyang kinukutsa. kaya di na rin ako nagulat na malayo ang loob niya sa lahat, except sakin. we're not really close talaga, pero kapag nagkasama naman kami (say, sa inuman or nagkasalubong), wala namang awkward air between us (take note: introvert ako, and i'm not close with my other cousins either). then, i remember this one time when our aunt told him right into his face na ""hindi ka kabilang sa pamilya na to"". i was there. kahit ako, nagulat sa sinabi ni tita. we recently talked about it, and he admitted na tumatak sa isip niya iyon. he's just 8 that time (12 naman ako). siguro para sa iba, sasabihin na lang na my cousin should be thankful pa rin dahil nga at least naranasan niya ang buhay marangya. after all, his real parents were just teenagers when he was conceived. pareho pang mahirap. pero ang akin lang, di naman kasi puro pera lang ang kailangan ng isang tao, especially a child. mas matimbang pa rin ang emotional support. kumbaga sa pagbuo ng bahay, it doesn't matter kung gaano kamahal at kaganda ang materyales na gagamitin mo. kung itatayo mo iyan nang walang pundasyon, bibigay din yan agad. ganoon din sa tao. alam nyo napapaisip ako tuloy bigla. what if my cousin was not treated differently? mabait naman kasi siya sa totoo lang. i never understand the hate, lalo na sa mga adult sa pamilya namin (like that tita i mentioned). makulit siguro siya, yes, pero mabait siya. and if my older relatives will just sit down and actually listen to him bago sila magalit, i think madali lang namang malulutas ang problema na to. but nah. we're in the philippines. old people can never be wrong here. sa mga planong mag-adopt dyan, please, pag-isipan n'yo munang mabuti kung talagang kaya n'yo bang panindigan ang responsibilidad sa aampunin n'yo. those children are not toys na kapag nanawa ka, pwede mong i-set aside. tao iyan. and being a parent is a lifelong commitment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/mjmz4i/i_wish_people_will_stop_adopting_kids_for_the/,4 04 2021
Barya lang daw sa umaga,"nagbayad ako ng 100 pesos para sa 55 pesos na pamasahe ng uv express mula cainta hanggang makati. pahingi daw ng 5 piso para suklian niya ako ng singkwenta, sabi ni manong driver. nag-sorry ako't wala akong 5 pesos. ""mamaya na lng ang sukli mo,"" sagot niya sa akin. ok lang. huminto pa kami sa gas station para magpagasolina. pinaalala ko yung sukli ko at sinabi na baka pwede siya magpabarya sa gasolinahan. hindi ako pinansin. may mga bumaba at may mga sumakay na pasahero. nagbayad. nasuklian. may mga bumaba uli at may mga sumakay. nagbayad din at nasuklian niya din. sa may bandang kalayaan, pinaalala ko uli sa kanya yung sukli ko. ""hindi ba sinuklian na kita? binilang ko yung pera ko dito, sakto lang a."" may dalawang mabait na pasaherong kumampi sa akin at nagsabi na hindi pa daw nga ako nasusuklian kahit na ilang beses na ako nagsabi (thank you, kuya at ate). kumamot ng ulo si driver (hindi ko na siya matawag na ""manong"" dahil nawala na ang respeto ko sa kanya). ""sandali,"" sagot niya. sabay abot sa akin ng mga halos tigbe-bente singko na barya. ""bilangin mo na lang,"" sagot pa niyang natatawa. nag-react ang ibang pasahero habang inaabot sa akin yung sukli. ""walastik naman itong si kuya"" sabi nu'ng isang lalaki. ""bastusan pala tayo dito,"" hirit pa nu'ng lalaking unang kumampi sa akin. ""sa susunod kasi, magbayad ng tama,"" mapagbunying sagot ng driver habang nakangisi. hindi ako kumibo at nagsimula nga ako magbilang. ""26.50 lang po ito. kulang pa kayo ng 18.50,"" sinambit ko. hindi kumibo ang driver. hanggang bumaba sa pbcom, hindi na siya nagsalita. ""kulang pa kayo ng 18.50,"" huling hirit ko bago bumaba. dedma. pumito na ang traffic enforcer at pinaaalis na siya. ""sana masarap ang ulam mo mamayang tanghali,"" huling hirit ko sa kanya sabay sara ng pinto. hindi naman ako madamot, at madalas galante pa. kahit sa mga estranghero. pero alam ko rin naman kung ginagago at binabastos na ako. god bless you na lang, mamang driver. at sana, mapunta sa maayos yung hindi mo isinukli sa akin. lahat naman tayo ngayon naghihirap din at nagpipilit madagdagan ang kita ng konti. maliit na halaga lang naman yung nawala sa akin, at hindi naman ako naghihikahos, pero yun sanang makita ko na mayroon pa ring mga patas at matapat na tao sa kabila ng kabi-kabilang krisis na kinakaharap natin, e hindi ko nakita ngayon. at sana nga, masarap ang ulam mo mamayang tanghali.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/x8lo4j/barya_lang_daw_sa_umaga/,8 09 2022

"As a 22-year old Filipina, how will you tell your parents that you want to go independent?","hi. i'm a 22-years old college student, mag-4th year college na sana. but due to nalulubog kami sa utang, naisip ko na if mag-aaral ako this year mas malulubog lang kami. kasi alam kong malamang eh kukunin ni mama yung pambayad ng tuition fees ko sa pangungutang lang din, and me knowing na marami pa syang ibang pinagkakautangan and bills pa na sa calculation ko ay nasa 200k-300k+ lahat, mas gugustuhin ko nalang na ibayad nya nalang yung ipapangtuition ko at supposedly baon ko araw-araw sa mga utang at bills. i am from somewhere in visayas and i have an ldr boyfriend from luzon for 2 years, thrice na nya ko pinuntahan dito sa visayas. we have small business na nasa luzon na sya yung nagmamanage, while i help naman sa mga pagmamanage like tracking the expenses, socmed postings, and etc na pwede kong ihelp kahit nasa malayo ako. now, dahil one-man lang si boyfie eh limited lang din yung nagiging kita since mahirap nga naman na mag-isa lang syang gumagawa sa lahat (food business kasi). i have decided na wag muna magcollege and pumunta muna sa luzon para din makahelp sa business namin ni boyfie, and expand narin. btw, graduate na si boyfie this year pero di muna sya nag aapply ng work since inaasikaso nga nya yung negosyo namin and gusto daw muna nya magpahinga sa field nya. and mahirap din kasi na nag-aaral ako tapos di ako gano makapagfocus dahil sa mga problema, tbh wala na kong peace of mind dahil toxic narin ng mama ko :( i have always planned na umalis dito at magpakalayo-layo, away from negativity and toxicity. ang pinoproblema ko lang ngayon ay kung paano ko sasabihin kay mama, papano ko ioopen yung topic? napakataas kasi ng pride ni mama at super mainitin ang ulo. ayoko din naman na lumayas nalang bigla, gusto ko magpaalam parin sakanya. nasa isip ko na kung anong isasagot ko, pero di ko alam pano talaga ioopen. my flight is sa saturday na.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/15k8u2n/as_a_22year_old_filipina_how_will_you_tell_your/,7 08 2023
"Kapag namulat sa katotohanan, kasalanang nang pumikit","my sister cried to me a while ago when she learned that our kasambahay who voted for bbm said “nandyan naman si lord” at nakangiti pa siya nung sinabi ko na “ate magdasal dasal ka na dahil paupo na si bbm” kasi it’s really possible that she might lose her work because of our plans to migrate asap. to give a background sa maid namin, may ugali siya na di namin nagugustuhan. she always lies. pag nagpapabili kami sa kanya dati sasabihin niya na sakto ang pera but we learned na kinupit niya yung natira. plastic din siya. pag napagsabihan siya, tatalikod tapos may sasabihing di maganda. and noong nagpaulan ng katigasan ng ulo, sinalo niya lahat. hindi lang namin siya ma-let go kasi mahirap talaga maghanap ng household help ngayong pandemic so pinagtiyatiyagaan kaysa wala. then we learned na she’s voting for bbm. we tried to convince her but to no avail, gusto niya talaga si bbm dahil sa nagawa raw ng tatay. and ayun nga matigas ulo ni ate. so back to my sister, when she learned na sinabi ni ate na “nandyan naman si lord” nagalit ang kapatid ko kasi hindi naman talaga namin plano magmigrate agad, so lahat ng plans ng sister ko parang uncertain na. iyak siya ng iyak. sabi niya “sinira nila ang future ko dahil lang sa simpleng ignorance” she’s only 17 pero ito na ang nararamdaman niya. ilang araw na siyang umiiyak dahil hindi niya alam ang mangyayari sa future niya. when i was 17, pinoproblema ko lang kung saan ako magkacollege. nakakalungkot kasi ang mga taong katulad ni ate parang walang pakialam. dahil maayos naman siyang pinapasweldo hindi niya na naiisip ang iba. alam ko nabiktima si ate ng fake news dahil lagi ko siya naririnig na nakikinig sa propaganda sa youtube at tiktok pero di kami nagkulang sa pagpapaintindi at pagdedebunk ng tama sa mali. ilang beses ko rin pinanood sa kanya ang mga videos ni chris tan. wala pa rin. kahit biktima siya ng fake news, accountable pa rin siya. sabi nga nila kapag namulat ka sa katotohanan, kasalanan nang pumikit. nakakalungkot lang dahil mataas pride ni ate mas pinili niya pa rin ang binoto niya. lahat tayo nadamay pa. and to my sister, i’m really sorry our country failed you. i hope it will be all right for you soon.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/uokxgk/kapag_namulat_sa_katotohanan_kasalanang_nang/,13 05 2022

ANNOYING THINGS RELIGIOUS PEOPLE/GROUPS DO. (TLDR if you're not interested),"i'm atheist and naturally, i find religion pointless and a load of self-indulgent egotistical nonsense but i mostly keep it to myself unless otherwise provoked. i don't go out into the streets and shove atheism down other people's throats - and for the record bwiset din ako sa mga atheists na sobrang outspoken na akala mo ikamamatay nila kapag di nila napatunayan na walang mga diyos. i don't give two fucks if friends and fam alike subscribe to a religion that promotes and encourages bigotry, homophobia, etc. as long as they don't break the law or interfere with my life so i won't go there. instead, i'll focus on the things that they do na nakakaabala sa mga nakapaligid sa kanila (in particular order). and don't even get me started dun sa mga nageendorse ng mga kandidato kapag eleksyon tapos may drama pang laying of the hands sa ulo habang nakapikit yung mga hudas na pulitiko. **1. jehovah's witnesses** ***-*** *the most annoying of the lot. the fact that they turn up during the most inconvenient hours on weekends (esp. while you're busy doing housework) makes me even want to smash them on the head with a really heavy leatherbound bible with decorative brass edges and an enormous medallion embossed in the center. afaik sila rin ang dahilan kung bakit nag-ooverflow ang basurahan ko dahil sa mga nyetang flyers na pinagsisisingit nila sa mga gilid-gilid ng gate. and lastly, kung ubos na ang slots para sa mga maliligtas ay makakapasok sa langit e bakit pa sila nag-eeffort magkayag ng mga bagong miyembro? saan mapupunta yung mga new recruits? house seats, fifth row center in the great theater in the sky? jesus wept.* **2. born again christians** (and pretty much any other christian denomination) *- at least they don't go knocking on people's doors on weekends but they have the resilience of a cockroach. they keep harping on and on and on about ""the lord"" and they'll drag you to join them na magsimba sa church nila if they could. tila di ata sila makabuo ng isang sentence na hindi nasisingit yung phrase na ""si/ni/kay lord"" to the point na naiirita nako every time na marinig ko na banggitin nila yang ""si lord"" nila. i find that rude kase in my case, those people were fully aware na atheist ako. lalo na kapag humirit na sila ng ""diba kapag may napanood kang magandang movie ang tendency mo is ikuwento mo?"" i told them na okay given that's the case, kaya lang kapag paulit ulit mo nang ineendorse yang lecheng movie na yan pero hanggang ngayon hindi parin interesado yung kausap mo it's time to give it a rest na diba? and guess what? not everyone fucking digs harry potter, game of thrones, lord of the rings, etc. and that's perfectly fine. you don't have to get so worked up about it.* **3. roman catholics** *- my major beef with this religion i grew up with is when the powers-that-be interfere with politics. although naiintindihan ko kse may vested interest yung mga higher-ups sa pagpapatakbo ng bansa. roman catholicism is not the most financially-literate religious group in the world for nothing. not to mention we practice catholicism of the most outdated and antiquated sort dito kaya ayun, naging hindrance kase may mga progressive laws sa western world na dapat noon pa naipatupad dito (e.g. abortion, divorce, etc.) kaya lang hinahadlangan ng mga powerful at nagtatabaang mga bishops. unfortunately, it appears secularization is nothing but a pipe dream dito sa pilipinas.* **4. iglesia ni cristo** *- eto pa isa pa to. in due time magdedemand narin to ng mga sangkatutak na holidays na dapat irecognize ng buong sambayanan. but at least they stick to their own kind kaya i find them tolerable most of the time naman. not sure kung may nagbabahay-bahay sa kanila kase wala pa naman akong naencounter. pero once na magsimulang magdemand to na ipagbawal ang mga kung anu-anong bagay-bagay dahil against sa belief system nila ay p\*t\*n\*i\*a there will be blood!* **5. mormons (church of jesus of latter-day saints)** *- paminsan minsan may naeencounter ako nito pero kahit nagbabahay-bahay din sila so far wala namang nagpainit ng ulo ko. i just told them politely i'm an atheist and i don't (and won't ever) subscribe to any organized religion and that's it, they just said their goodbyes sans fanfare. nakakaaliw pa nga yung mga kano na sobrang fluent magtagalog e. minsan nga kino-coach ko pa e kse may mga ginagamit silang tagalog words na sobrang quaint na at baka mapagtawanan pa sila.* **6. muslims** *- the ones i find the most tolerable. they stick to their own kind like all the time. and contrary to popular belief, they're mostly peaceful and they tend to leave others well alone as long as you don't try to offend them on purpose. may mga muslim friends nga ako nung college na kaharap ko pa kpg kumakain ako ng barbecue wala lang sa kanila dedma lang and di namin dinidiscuss it in the first place. they rarely engage in pointless religious debates with non-muslims. yung suki ko nga dati nung uso pa ang pirated dvds nagbebenta pa ng mga religious movies kpg malapit na ang holy week e. as an animal rights advocate i'm not in favor of some jalal practices though...* the rest tulad ng mga buddhists, hindus at jewish bihira ako maka-encounter ng mga members nila kaya wala ako ma-criticize sa mga gawain nila. nung bata ako may naalala pa nga akong grupo ng mga hindus na once in a while nagpaparada sa kalsada tapos namimigay ng popcorn na nakabalot sa papel de hapon kaya may extra brownie points pa sila sakin. minsan nga 2 pa ang nahihingi ko e. :p &#x200b; end of rant.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/xr4ir5/annoying_things_religious_peoplegroups_do_tldr_if/,29 09 2022

(Long post),"hello everyone! i'm from linao (east), tuguegarao city, yung sobrang lubog sa baha na barangay na trending sa buong social media. first and foremost, we[together with my fam & relatives] are safe from the flood(thanks god!). we are here at zone 2 of the barangay and yung totally flooded (lagpas bahay) is nasa zone 6 or 7, not quite sure. humuhupa na po ang baha at sana magtuloy-tuloy na. looking back at 11pm of nov. 13, 3 steps nalang po ng hagdan bago maabot ang 2nd floor ng bahay to think na elevated pa itong bahay so how much more na sa mga mabababang bahay, totally submerged na sila sa tubig baha. hindi makapasok ang mga rescuers dahil hindi kasya ang mga motorized rubber boats sa mga eskinita ng mga natrap na tao. idagdag mo ring zero visibility kasi napaka dilim dahil brownout sa buong lugar. iniisip na naming lumikas pero ang aking nanay at mga(3) tita ay kalmado lamang, nakahigang nasa likod ng ulo ang mga kamay at sabing ""sanay kami maligo sa dagat. huwag niyo kaming alalahanin, hindi kami aalis dito sa bahay"". sobrang nakakatakot sa labas kasi napakalakas ng agos ng baha, isang maling tapak at na-outbalance ka, siguradong buhay mo kaagad ang kapalit. we stayed in our house. i prayed nalang talaga na bumaba ang baha at pagsapit ng 2:37am ng nov.14, chineck ko yung pencil marks na ginawa ko ng 11pm sa dingding namin, bumaba pero almost 1 inch lang. (sobrang saya ko na dito kasi king ina at least bumaba na). tumuntong ako sa bubong ng sala namin na nasa bukana lang ng aming bintana, huminga ng malalim at napatulala sa mga bituin. sobrang dilim at tahimik ng paligid, ang tanging naririnig ko lamang ay mga tunog ng palaka. maya-maya, parang may mga naririnig akong mga boses ng tao at finocus ko ang pandinig sa mga iyon disregarding ang mga palaka, and wtf, ang naririnig ko na sinasabi ng mga tao ay ""rescue"" at ""tulong"" echoing all over our barangay in all directions. sobrang hina lamang ng naririnig ko dahil sa kalayuan ng mga taong sumisigaw. (kung napakinggan niyo yung 17sec clip ng mga tao sa social media na sumisigaw ng ""rescue"", yes that's all true. pero imagine hearing it personally from 3am to 4:30am, wala na talaga akong magagawa kundi ipagdasal na sana maabot na ng rescuers ang aking mga ka-barangay.) ako'y napraning at chineck ulit ang tubig ng 4:30am, bumaba pa ito ng 1 inch. i was so happy na sa span ng 5 hrs, bumaba ang tubig ng 2 inches. yes. 2. freaking. inches. my goodness! as of now, patuloy nang humuhupa ang baha. mababaw na ang tubig, hanggang dibdib na lamang sa labas ng bahay. i mean, may kalaliman parin pero kumpara nung peak ng baha, lagpas pa siguro kahit iangat ko ang aking kamay. approx 6-7ft (i'm 5'7 btw, alam ko to kasi bumili ako ng pagkain namin para dito sa bahay, hanggang leeg tas naka tip-toe ako sa tubig). note na sa zone 2 lamang po ito, sa ibang zones baka umabot ng 15-20ft. i'm writing this at 9pm of november 14, 2020(will probably post it late bc of signal issues), naghihintay ng mga ipamimigay na tubig-inumin dahil trapped parin po kami sa baha. gustuhin ko mang maging bridge of all donations for us here sa flooded area pero trapped parin po kami sa baha at kami rin po mismo ay nangangailangan ng tulong. i excluded all political aspects, didn't dig deep sa mga issues like ""nasaan si mayor"" issue, ""okay lang ang cagayan"" issue by governor, and kilala niyo na kung sinong tinutukoy kong gustong lumangoy. vp leni, u da real mvp being the 1st one to respond to our calls from the national politicians. (alam kong may kanya kanya tayong manok pero sana hindi tayo magbulag-bulagan) #2022 sobrang nakakatakot ang rumaragasang tubig ng baha, sana lagi po tayong mag-iingat. nakalimutan na po ng mga tao ang social distancing dahil hand in hand po kaming nakikipag-sapalaran at nakikipag-laban para sa buhay laban sa bahang ito. ito ang aking mga karanasan sa baha, pasensya kung may mali man kayong makita at mabasa. please pray for us. kapit lang. babangon ulit tayo. maraming salamat sa lahat ng tumulong, tumutulong at tutulong pa lalo na sa mga rescuers natin. this is the worst flood i've ever had. please be safe! #cagayanvalleyneedshelp #bangoncagayanvalley",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ju3w8l/my_experience_in_tuguegarao_city_flooding_long/,14 11 2020

Tenant failed to pay rent and security deposit. Been almost 3 months since move in,"hi, i have a tenant who moved in january. she issued a check covering the advance payment and 2 months security deposit. however, the check bounced and until now, she hasn’t paid me a single centavo since moving in. despite repeated demands, she failed to do so and reneged on her promise to pay and been making excuses. i was even informed last week by the admin asking if i allowed her to have the unit subleased. turns out she was misrepresenting herself as the owner and transacted with a supposed sublessor. buti nalang nalaman ko agad or else they would have deposited an additional 10k on top of he 3,500 “reservation fee”. been in close contact with them with the plan to entrap my tenant. found out also she’s been lying to me kasi inconsistent mga sinasabi niya sakin and sa supposed sublessees. as much as possible, i don’t want to take legal action cause i know it’ll take so much of my time and effort. hirap din maglakad ng mga ganito na may covid tumataas na naman cases. will resort to this pag no choice na talaga. i am now writing a demand letter to my tenant. question is, since she hasn’t paid the first month rent including security deposit, should i also include the deposit in the demand letter even if i am also asking her to vacate the unit? she has unpaid utility bills for jan and feb, and now march. i’m not sure whether to include the deposit or just demand her to pay the bills. my fear is baka takbuhan na ko, which i know sadly, is what usually happens. also, what else can i do to make her pay without resorting to legal action? (as in last resort na talaga yan) would gladly hear from those who have experienced the same thing or is involved with rental business. thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/m5zgie/tenant_failed_to_pay_rent_and_security_deposit/,16 03 2021

Paano kayo nagccope up sa pagkawala ng mahal ninyo sa buhay?,"it's been 2 weeks since my father died. sobrang bilis, ang lakas niya pa lang tapos bigla na lang siyang nastroke. sabi ng doctor niya makakauwi na siya, pero yung day na dapat uuwi na siya ang day ng libing niya. hanggang ngayon, hindi pa rin mawala sa isip ko kung may pagkukulang ang mga doctor ni papa. doctor ni papa na cardiologist ang humawak sa case niya, nadiagnose siya ng hemorrhagic stroke, pumutok ang ugat sa utak niya at kailangan pigilan ang pagkalat ng dugo. sobrang confident namin sa doc ni papa kasi sabi magaling daw, ang sabi after 5 days ic-ct scan ulit si papa. ang lakas ni papa kahit nung 1-2 days niya sa icu. inaalis niya pa ngt sa ilong niya and malikot ang left side niya though hindi niya magalaw ang right side ng katawan niya at hindi namin siya makausap. 3rd day ni papa sa icu, sinabihan siya ng doctor niya na makakalabas na siya ng icu ng thursday (saturday ng madaling araw na stroke si papa at nadala namin siya agad sa ospital). at sabi, saturday makakauwi na siya sa amin. ayan ang advise ng doc niya sa amin bago umalis ang doc ni papa at nagseminar o may pinuntahan sa ibang bansa at iniwan sa isang doc na iternist. that day, nanghina si papa. ang dating malakas na grip na kamay niya at malikot niyang paggalaw ay humina... akala namin okay na... sobrang taranta na namin at late na na may nakapagsabi sa amin na kakilala na bakit walang neurologist si papa. kailangan daw niya neuro. late rin namin nalaman na cardio and internist doctors lang humahawak kay papa. before that, tanong na kami nang tanong sa mga nurses. nagtanong pa kami bakit hindi pa ict-scan si papa dahil nanghina siya. ang sabi, hindi na raw kailangan daw lalabas na siya. binawasan din mga gamot niya. kaso ang sabi nagka-infection daw siya sa dugo dahil hindi mawala ang lagnat niya kay binigyan siya ng antibiotics. thursday nang malaman namin na walang neuro si papa at kailangan niya ng neuro. pinilit namin na ipatingin si papa sa neuro kahit na nagagalit na samin mga nurses. cardio raw ang kailangan ni papa at hindi neuro. pinapirma kami ng waiver na kami ang nag-ask for neuro at hindi ang doctor ni papa. turns out, nang icheck siya ng neuro bakit daw hindi na-ct scan agad. dapat 2-3 days na ct scan daw ulit para malaman kung namaga utak ni papa. mali pa raw ang antibiotics na ibinibigay kay papa, sobrang baba raw dapat daw malakas dahil sa utak nga daw ang problema ni papa. thursday night, bumagsak katawan ni papa. ang gcs niya from 10 nang dinala namin siya sa ospital to 3. kumalat na daw ang dugo sa utak ni papa as per result ng ct scan sabi ng neuro niya baka kailanganin niya ng surgery. that night, sobrang bumaba bp niya, naging abnormal heartbeat niya at super nahirapan siyang huminga nilagyan na siya ng tube. super sakit akala namin makakauwi na siya tapos friday ng madaling araw nawala na siya. super sakit, before siya mastroke pinag-uusapan pa lang namin graduation ko. sabi niya super proud siya sa amin magkakapatid. ngayon hindi na niya ako makikitang ggraduate....yung panganay niya, walang tatay sa graduation. hindi ko alam kung may pagkukulang mga doctors niya or what, until now di pa rin namin nassettle ang bill. ang hirap magsalita kasi di naman kami expert pero para sa akin may pagkukulang sila. hindi ko sila sinisisi pero ang sama-sama ng loob ko!!! may times na parang okay na, pero kapag naaalala ko si papa... ang sakit-sakit, sobrang miss ko na siya. sobrang miss ko na ang papa ko. unang anak niya na mapapagraduate niya ng college, hindi niya makikita... kahit na mahirap, pinag-aaral niya kaming apat. ang sakit-sakit pa rin... hindi ko alam paano magccope up sa pagkawala ni papa...",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/14hwjjn/paano_kayo_nagccope_up_sa_pagkawala_ng_mahal/,24 06 2023
Creatures of Philippine Lower Mythology,"reading this book it details the physical attributes, magic and power, capabilities and domiciles of philippine lower mythological beings like demons (kapre, tikbalang) aswangs, witches, mermaids and engkantos. the book taps the history of pre-colonial philippines. the book also explore the comprehensive effects of these creatures in the daily life of filipinos. positive man or negative. while some filipinos believe in the existence of these creatures, some may not. i personally believe that science should triumph over superstitious or primitive beliefs. that everything has a logical explanations be it sa pagkalampag ng bubong (dahil dinapuan ng aswang ang bubong) or itim na aso na umaaligid sa bahay ng may sakit. however, nakakaaliw din magbasa or makinig ng mga stories tungkol sa aswang, mangkukulam, engkanto, tikbalang and etc. so bilang malapit na ang halloween at bilang batang pinanganak ng early 90s na part ng school life yung pinagkwekwentuhan ang mga kwentong kakatakutan kapag ganitong buwan…drop your stories here (narinig man or naexperience) about these creatures of the night.",https://i.redd.it/15237my7qysb1.jpg,8 10 2023

kaya mo ba akong samahan papunta sa kanya?” nagisip isip si richard at walang maisagot sa babae. “may sakit ako at konti na lang ang oras ko dito, sya na lang ang pag asa ko.” “sasamahan kita sa kanya, pero wag ka magugulat sa makikita mo.” bumaba papuntang lobby ang dalawa at lumabas ng hotel. kahit lagpas alas-onse ng gabi ay madami pa din mga kotse sa kalsada. “malayo ba sya?” “walang deretsong jeep papunta sa pwesto nya, lakarin na lang natin.” sarado na ang mga tindahan bukod sa mga 7-11 na nadaraanan ng dalawa. nakapag sindi na din ng sigarilyo si richard habang nag lalakad. “matagal ka na dito sa maynila?” “mga tatlumpung taon na.” “alam ng kutsero kung ano ka?” “oo, mabait ang pamilyang yun sa akin. yung kutsero kanina, anak na yun ng may ari ng kalesa.” “meron din kagaya mo sa bohol, pero sa ibang lugar sila nakatira. may kilala akong apat na kagaya mo doon.” “ikaw pa lang ang manananggal na nakita ko dito sa loob ng apat na taon. may nakilala ako dati na nagging flight stewardess. mahilig yata kayo talagang lumipad.” “di ko yata kaya ang mawalay sa mga tanim at alaga ko. parang ikaw, mukha naman kuntento ka na sa pamilyang kumupkop sayo.” “araguy!” napatigil ang matandang babae dahil sa sakit sa tagiliran. inalalayan naman sya ni richard. “mabilis sana kung lumipad tayo, pero di ko alam saan ang pupuntahan natin.” “di mo ako kayang bitbitin, manang” “akala mo lang, tikbalang” “malapit na din tayo, ulitin ko lang, wag ka magulat sa makikita mo.” tumango si avelina sa sinabi ni richard. nakarating sila sa quiapo church at naglakad patungo sa mga eskinita sa tabi nito. may tindahan ng mga halamang gamot at iba rito ay nasa botelya. “pampa-regla” “gamot sa eksema” mga nakadikit sa bote. may matandang lalaking panot at mabahong natutulog sa tabi ng tindahan na ito. “sya ang hinahanap mo” sabi ni richard kay manang. lumuhod si manang kay bathala at binaba ang ulo. umubo si richard para magising si bathala. walang nangyari at patuloy lang sa pag hilik ang matandang lalaki. tinapik na ni richard ang upuan ng lalaki kaya ito nagising. nagulat si bathala ng makitang si manang avelina na nakaluhod sa harapan nya sabay tingin kay richard. “hoy kamusta, richard? buhat na dyan, di mo kailangan gawin yan, basta may pambayad ka may gamot ako dito. hula ko hindi pampa regla ang kailangan mo.” “bumyahe pa yan mula bohol para makita ka.” sabi ni richard. “meron po akong sakit at kailangan ko ang tulong nyo.” “ano ang sakit mo?” at kinuwento nga ni manang avelina ang kanyang mga sintomas at nakinig naman si bathala. “pasensya ka na, pero wala akong maitutulong sa sakit mo. mga gamot na mabibigay ko ay pantulong lang sa kirot pero di ito mapapahaba ang buhay mo.” “naniniwala pa po ako sa inyong kapangyarihan. baka pwede nyo pong gamitin ang kapangyarihan nyo sa akin.” natawa si bathala. “nakikita mo ba ako? tatlong araw na akong di nakakaligo at nagbabantay na lang ako ng tindahan na ito. dito ako natutulog dahil wala akong bahay. alam mo kung bakit ko piniling pumwesto dito sa simbahan ng quiapo? para maramdaman ko man lang na ako ang sinasamba ng mga tao pero hindi ako ang sinasamba nila kaya’t wala na akong kapangyarihan. ang mangilan-ngilan na kapangyarihan ko sa mga mangigilan na bumubulong ng pangalan ko sa kanilang dasal ay binubuhos ko sa mga gamot na to.” “alam mo sinasamba ng mga tao ngayon?

relatives na leech. ano dapat gawin?,"di ko alam saan magsisimula hahaha kasi andami kong gusto sabihin pero basically ang mom ko kasi masyadong mabait pagdating sa pera. you see, may mga relatives kami sa side niya na lagi at malaki na ang naitulong samin mula sa paglipat ng bahay, paggawa ng mga may sira naming gamit, etc. pero truthfully willing lang silang tumulong kasi alam nilang may kapalit. pupunta lang ng bahay ikaw pa magaabot ng pamasahe paguwi? naghatid ka lang ng pagkain aabutan ka na ng panggasolina? pagdadrive ka sobra pa sa bayad ang bibigay mo? may sariling silang pamilya pero sa pamilya ng iba sila sumasandal at aasa ng pera galing abroad? lahat kaming magkakapatid alam namin ugali nila and how easy it is for our mom to let go and give money, lagi ko pa nga sinasabi balang araw kelangan niyo i-real talk yan pero wala naman nangyayari, alam kong ayaw din nila masaktan si mama lalo pa may sakit na sa puso at baka kung ano pa mangyari, at alam din naman na pwede niya rin yun gamitin as advantage magawa at masunod lang ang gusto. magouuting kami sa mom ko pa din sila aasa sa food at entrance fee, my god. maraming beses na ang pagaaway na nangyayari dahil lagi siya nauubusan ng pera kahit di naman siya gumagastos, kasi alam namin kung saan napupunta yung monthly ayuda niya na should be for her meds, necessities, etc. the fact na di nagpapadala isa naming kapatid dahil alam niyang napupunta sa walang kwentang bagay ang pera says a lot, which i understand dahil kung ako siya i would do the same. hayyy nakakainis lang talaga yung ganitong attitude ng filipino families na relatives na nga lang eh ang itetake advantage ka pa dahil alam nilang ikaw lang ang meron. kaya naman nilang kumilos, gumawa at magtrabaho pero hindi asa sila sa mom ko. naka-experience ba kayo ng ganito? ano dapat gawin?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/1673xjw/relatives_na_leech_ano_dapat_gawin/,1 09 2023

Permanent WFH Setup: Filipinos Should Look Into Virtual Assistant (VA) Industry,"i want to share this here hoping that it could help some people who are tired from the daily commute that they have to endure just to get to work. marami pa ibang dahilan bakit gusto mag wfh ng isang tao katulad ng: * kailangan mag alaga ng anak o kapamilya na may sakit o matanda na, * malayo ang bahay sa trabaho kaya gusto makatipid sa pamasahe/gas, * estudyante na gusto ng pang allowance/tuition, * may sakit pero kailangan pa rin magtrabaho para may kita, * etc. virtual assistant (va) is a general term that refers to freelancers working **remotely** for **foreign clients**. merong mga freelancers na hindi remote workers (e.g. photographer, model, insurance agent, etc.) kaya wag ka malilito sa term na ""freelancer"" at ""va"". vas yung mga nagtatrabaho sa bahay, sa coffee shop, sa beach, kahit saan kase ""remote worker"" sila. never nila poproblemahin ang return-to-office (rto) order kase nasa ibang bansa yung client nila. anong pwede maging trabaho ng va? depende sa designation. a va can be a/an: * administrative assistant, * architect, * auditor, * bookkeeper, * content creator, * customer service representative, * graphic designer, * human resource, * it personnel * paralegal, * seo specialist, * social media manager, * web developer, * writer, * etc. halos lahat ng designation pwede ma-categorize as va basta permanent wfh + foreign client. just like traditional jobs, you need to apply for the position, undergo interview, training and you can be laid off too due to poor performance, bankruptcy, world crisis, etc. > pros ng pagiging va 1. permanent wfh setup 2. flexible hours (depending on the contract) 3. salary in foreign currency 4. lower tax rate 5. work-life balance > cons ng pagiging va 1. you need to be tech savvy to start in this field, 2. saturated market. madami gusto mag wfh ever since nag pandemic, 3. no ph government benefits, ikaw magfa-file ng taxes mo at magbabayad ng contributions mo as self-employed, 4. no hmo, 13th month pay and bonus **unless** mag agree kayo ng client na meron 5. you need to be independent and resourceful kase kung gusto mo tinuturo lahat sayo at wala ka initiative matuto mag isa, mahirap. short story: i became a part-time va (social media manager) in 2016. i worked with an australian client but i left after 6 months kase mababa ang sahod tapos lakas mag micro-manage and nag focus na lang ako sa pag aaral. tumigil ako ng ilang taon, kinalimutan ko na, maliit naman sahod. in 2019, few months before covid lockdown, i tried again because school expenses are hurting my pocket. this time, i am a full-time va (administrative assistant) for a us client. my starting salary was php22,500 and then it went up to 25k to 27k to 50k. i was promoted to operations manager and started earning php100k a month. after graduation and during bar review, i continued working. when i passed the bar exam in 2022, i told my client that i will leave the job so i can focus on my legal career. he does not want me to leave so he doubled my salary from 2k usd to 4k usd (php200k a month). he also pays for our medical insurance, 13th and 14th month pay, monthly bonus and gadget upgrade. currently, i have 2 jobs: va and my traditional job. mahirap ang buhay. kung kaya mag double job, grab it. you can learn to be a va through: 1. reddit (r/buhaydigital) 2. facebook (online filipino freelancers page) 3. youtube 4. other vas 5. google hindi kami hiring ngayon, wag nyo i-send saken resume nyo. protect your identity, this is reddit. i am just hoping that this could help someone who wants a permanent wfh setup. sobrang pahirap yung public transportation system sa pilipinas, and it will take years and good leaders before we see improvements. that's it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/w8j318/permanent_wfh_setup_filipinos_should_look_into/,26 07 2022
Traffic is being normalized in the Philippines,"while on my way to work this morning, i just realized how covid-19 affected us in a good way. of course, i'm not talking about those people who got sick and died but about the fact that somehow it made our commutes/rides easier. now na marami ng nag-return to office and sooner ay start na rin ng face to face classes sa public schools, unti-unti ng bumabalik yung usual traffic na nararanasan natin everyday before. nakakawalang gana lang. i miss those times na konti lang yung taong nakakalabas. ang sakit lang isipin na normal na lang to sa atin. yung ang aga-aga mo na ngang gumigising sa umaga para makipagsapalaran sa pag-cocommute tapos malelate ka pa. yung ang mahal ng pamasahe pero kalahati lang ng pwet mo yung nakaupo. yung ang mahal ng gasolina tapos di mo naman nasusulit kasi ilang oras ka nakastuck sa traffic. haay, it's indeed more fun in the philippines. this is why mas maganda na talagang mag-freelance na lang or maghanap ng work na fully remote. malaki na matitipid mo, less stress pa.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/wljuen/traffic_is_being_normalized_in_the_philippines/,11 08 2022
Open your eyes,"i will begin by prefacing that i am nobody special, i do not have any redeeming qualities or anything that set me apart from the mass. my only service to the country is the money that i pay in the form of taxes, as well as my desire for it to improve. i will not hide behind a falsified pretense, and i will be upfront and direct. all throughout my life, i've always harbored distaste towards philippines. to me, it was largely unruly and hypocritical; i was forced to suffer through a life so intricately tied to politics. a large number of my family members are connected to politics, i grew up hearing and seeing about politics. my aunts and uncles? politicians. that isn't to say that i have a keen understanding and comprehension of it, no. i am not an analyst, nor am i sagacious enough to pinpoint the finer details of such things. at first, i wanted to become a great person. a lawyer to uphold the law. or perhaps a soldier to fight in the frontlines to protect it. but that steadily deteriorated until money became what i desired, i wanted to become a teacher so that i may teach and at the same time earn money. then even that shattered under the weight of this society. perhaps this is what many would construe as an existential dread; i knew not what i wished to do. in time, i began to grow jaded and exhausted of it all, eventually ceasing to think about my motherland anymore. i considered it to be too congealed in corruption for it to ever be cleansed of it. but now, it's gotten to the point that i can no longer stop caring or averting my eyes. however, **i am powerless.** all i have to offer now are the experiences that i've gone through, the wisdom i picked up throughout my life, my knowledge and my very creed. my voice may go unheard, my ripple may end up small and my wisdom? obsolete. but that matters not. my fellow filipinos, i implore you, i beseech you, to never stop thinking and to never surrender your self. your ethos and your ego. do not simply conform and follow the tide, do not simply melt into the masses like i have in the past. i have staggered because of it, sacrificing my individuality to fit in. do not make that same mistake. ""i think, therefore i am."" is one of my lifelines, but perhaps it truly is harder to see what is right underneath you as i have failed to employ this line until recently. **i am reaching out not to those who are already awake and can see this injustice, i am calling out to the slumbering hearts of those who support president rodrigo roa duterte, better known as the dds.** i am begging you, my kinsmen. open your eyes. do not surrender your very identity for the sake of money, do not surrender your very ego and allow the society to congeal into yourself, turning you into yet another faceless flock. i know that you are not stupid, i know that you are not foolish. look around you, and think for yourself. listen to the voices around you, the loud cries and the hushed whispers then think for yourself. think, so that you will remain yourself. think, so that you may retain all the years you've spent living your life. you are you, no one else may ever become you. you are a unique existence that can only be a singular person in this entire fabric of reality. do not surrender the treasure that is your ego solely for money, or worse for empty platitudes. think, what has he done for us during this time of crisis? enumerate every single one of them in your mind. list them out, so that you may better quantify the help that you believe he has given us. comprehend and think of every single benefit he may have given us. then think, what has he done against us during this time of crisis? what has he done to oppress us? list them out, seek them out, discern every deed that he may have done that harmed us directly, or indirectly. identify things that he may have **not** done to help us, for there is nothing worse than inaction in a time of need. please, if you would only do this not for me, but for yourself who has lived many years of your life remaining who you are. i am begging you. and to the rest of us, who are wide awake after this harsh jolt from reality. may you accept this heartfelt present if you can read this. accept the lessons i have learned from my life, accept the experiences that i have gone through and catalyzed for those of us in dire straits. even if it hurts, even if it's tiring, even if it doesn't seem to make sense. never stop thinking, never stop trying to understand what is happening. for to think is to be yourself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ftzfc7/open_your_eyes/,3 04 2020

"We lost contact with our mom, who works as an overseas Filipino worker in Riyadh","tl;dr: we have not heard anything from our mom for four days and we are worried about her safety. i reached out to her agency but there’s no update yet about her situation there. hello , i am the oldest son and just wanted to get this off my chest. i am currently a 3rd yr student and masyado akong na-busy last week gawa't midterms namin yon. last tuesday, napansin ko na hindi na tumatawag or nagchachat si mama at nakita ko na hindi siya talaga nag o-online. nagtaka na ko at sinubukan kong siyang i-message pero walang reply. ang last convo namin at last activity niya sa fb niya ay nung saturday pa. nag sabi na ko sa so ko at sabi niya we'll call owwa tom if wala pa rin response si mama that day. kinabuksan, tinawagan ko na ang owwa at binigay naman ang cellphone number ng agency ni mama para matawagan at i-raise ang concern. tinawagan ko pero walang sumasagot so nag iwan lang ako ng message. later that night, nag reply naman at sinabing ipapaabot daw nila sa foreign recruitment agency (fra). kinabukasan (today), nag send na ng message ang agency ni mama sa fra this morning at nag reply naman ang fra na they will check with the employer at babalikan daw ang agency kapag may update na. we were all so worried na to the point na si tita, nataranta na at tinawagan ang agency, baka raw inaway na ni tita ang nakausap niya sa agency at binantaan na ipapa tulfo daw (naiintindihan ko naman si tita kay usually ganon talaga mga kilala kong boomers) sabi ni ate na pinsan ko. now, super grateful ako kay so na nagagawa niya kong pakalmahin kahit napaka overthinker ko. we will pray for mama's safety there in riyadh. if may mga kakilala kayo sa fra o nasa riyadh (near alyasmi ), please baka matulungan niyo ko sa concern namin. i forgot, nung last vc namin ni mama ay nabanggit niya na minsan nahahampas niya na ang cp niya kasi raw naglalag gawa nang mabagal ang internet. hindi naman nananakit ang amo niya, mabait naman daw pero sinasabi niyang kuripot kay tinitipid daw siya sa food. so, i assumed na nasira ang phone ni mama kaya hindi namin siya ma-contact. i tried locating her phone through google's 'find my device' app, but i can't locate her. di naman nag ooff si mama ng gps niya sa phone kasi chinecheck ko yan siya before sa app na yan. ang concern ko lang ay baka ma-depress si mama ng todo kasi palagi siya nag rarant sa amin everyday sa tuwing tumatawag siya na nababagot na daw siya doon kasi wala siyang makausap. palagi niya kaming tinatawagan para hindi siya ma-bored doon, kahit na choppy siya. i will be celebrating my bday this month and my only wish is for her to be safe palagi sa saudi. debut ko na this yr at gusto ko sana kasama ko buong family ko mag celebrate pero nasa malayo si mama. pero kahit sana maka-vc man lang namin siya. i hope she's okay. i really miss her. take ko na rin tong opportunity to ask if totoo ba na hindi usually nasusunod ang kontrata ng mga ofw (in middle east, particularly, saudi), lalo na sa day off? update: a friend of my cousin's friend contacted my mother's employer and hung up when she uttered my mother's name. update (2): i want to express my heartfelt gratitude po for the overwhelming support and concern many of you shared in response to this post. i'm relieved to update you all na we've heard from my mom na, and she's safe, thank god! it turns out her employer's internet service was temporarily disconnected, and they estimate it could take up to 2 weeks to resolve. ito po yung reason bakit hindi siya nakapag-contact sa amin. wala po siyang sim card ng saudi and she doesn't have mobile data. di rin po siya basta pina-connect ng amo niya sa data nila. luckily, maybe after ma-raise ang concerns sa iba't-ibang agencies particularly sa fra ng mom ko na ilang beses tinawagan yung employer, her employer finally allowed her brief access to their data po, allowing her to contact us and provide reassurance. it was a very tough time for our entire family. i can't imagine if anything bad happens sa mom ko. thank you all for your support and kind words. it means the world to us, and we're now in a much better state knowing my mom is okay. appreciate you all po! lahat ng comments niyo binasa ko at sobrang laking tulong ng mga suggestions ninyo, and most importantly, ng mga prayers ninyong lahat 🙏 lesson learned: ngayon ko na-realize na ibang-iba talaga ang culture sa saudi. reality hits hard. di ko inexpect na pati sa mobile data ay kayang ipagdamot ng employer ng mama ko. tho i still believe na hindi naman lahat ng stereotype patungkol sa mga arabs ay totoo and cultural diversity plays a role in this. despite our struggles, i'm still very much grateful that my mom is safe and sound.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/18cr8a4/we_lost_contact_with_our_mom_who_works_as_an/,7 12 2023

Ito ang sa akin and sana mabasa niyo ang mahahabang experience ko.,"basically yung bagyo pwede na iconsider na f4 tornado sa us kung gagawin tornado shape ang bagyong rolly. saturday evening wala pa kaming naramdam, literal na calm before the storm. nakapag internet pa ko ng konti hanggang midnight. 3am sunday na nagsisimula ang lakas ng hangin. kahit naka typhoon guard, ramdam pa din ang hampas ng hangin sa gilid ng bintana. 4am na considered na landfall sa catanduanes. ito kaya ang pinakamalakas na bagyo sa buhay ni lolo ko. at tama nga, kasi zero visibility ang sa paligid namin kahit nakikitang umaga na. baha na ang first floor namin. at believe or not pero dahil sa change in air pressure naka bingi yung bilis ng hangin. parang kung lalong bibilis pa, puputok na ata ang ear drums ko. 7am sunday humina na ang bagyo sa catanduanes. nakikita na ang tabing bundok sa amin at unsurprisingly wala ng dahon dun na may landslides na padagdag. yung backyard namin na dating may dahon at puno ngayon ubos na. bagsak na ang mga niyog, at kung di binagong lugar ang mga aso namin patay sila sa na bagsak na niyog sa doghouse nila (ironically ang hindi gaano kasira ay ang bahay kubo namin). sa mga kapitbahay namin halatang nawala yung parte ng bubong nila. nagikot ako sa barangay namin na lahat ng poste either bagsak na or nakasabit sa puno. yung simbahan namin malaki wala na yung bubong, parang lalagyan palang eh. pero mabilis mag linis ang mga tao sa kalye, kailangan lang iaayos at least yung mga poste na baka matumba at matamaan ang mga tao. maraming stories na madaming nalunod or meron namatay pero wala naman kaming maayos na kommunikasyon so di pa gaano ka legit ang mga sabi sabi. pero ang alam kong totoo ay hindi pa kami magkakatubig for around 3 months since galing yan sa bundok na tamaan ng bagyo. then yung kuryente, kung di pa pupunta ang outside help di ko alam kailan pa yan makaayos, meaning extend pa lalo ang online class namin. pero yung nakakatakot ay yung isang barangay sa may bundok na converge ang tubig ng ilog sa tubig galing sa bundok kasama ng malakas na bagyo. isipin niyo yung usual public high school sa manila, baha hanggang kisame ng 1st floor at naabot na din sa 2nd floor. puro basag at putik sa classroom. at mga nara bagsak sa classroom. wala na dun pwedeng isalvage. meron din akong nabasa kanina lang na kinalimutan kami ng goberyno? i mean sure salty ako at sobrang laki ng disrespeto sa amin pero ganyan naman talaga dati. kung nagtanong ka tungkol sa catanduanes, ang masasabi nila sa visayas yan (mali sa luzon pa kami), or the usual wala sila alam. kung hindi malakas ang tourism ng catanduanes in the recent years, parehas lang ang sagot ng karamihan. sinabi na ng gob ng catanduanes pero uulitin ko, sa kultura namin ang bagyo. before and after agad agad na kami nagaayos. hindi na kami na expect ng outside help galing sa goberyno o ano man yan. kahit walang maabot ng tulong inprogress na kami para maayos ang lahat. pero di masasabi na konting damage lang sa amin. dami ko nang narinig na depressing stories dito and hopefully stories lang maabot niyan. dito muna ako, reserve pa din akong load and battery as long as possible. baka next year na kami magkakakuryente.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/joc5vx/konti_lang_ang_nag_share_ng_experience_ng_bagyong/,5 11 2020

Paano kayo nagccope up sa pagkawala ng mahal ninyo sa buhay?,"it's been 2 weeks since my father died. sobrang bilis, ang lakas niya pa lang tapos bigla na lang siyang nastroke. sabi ng doctor niya makakauwi na siya, pero yung day na dapat uuwi na siya ang day ng libing niya. hanggang ngayon, hindi pa rin mawala sa isip ko kung may pagkukulang ang mga doctor ni papa. doctor ni papa na cardiologist ang humawak sa case niya, nadiagnose siya ng hemorrhagic stroke, pumutok ang ugat sa utak niya at kailangan pigilan ang pagkalat ng dugo. sobrang confident namin sa doc ni papa kasi sabi magaling daw, ang sabi after 5 days ic-ct scan ulit si papa. ang lakas ni papa kahit nung 1-2 days niya sa icu. inaalis niya pa ngt sa ilong niya and malikot ang left side niya though hindi niya magalaw ang right side ng katawan niya at hindi namin siya makausap. 3rd day ni papa sa icu, sinabihan siya ng doctor niya na makakalabas na siya ng icu ng thursday (saturday ng madaling araw na stroke si papa at nadala namin siya agad sa ospital). at sabi, saturday makakauwi na siya sa amin. ayan ang advise ng doc niya sa amin bago umalis ang doc ni papa at nagseminar o may pinuntahan sa ibang bansa at iniwan sa isang doc na iternist. that day, nanghina si papa. ang dating malakas na grip na kamay niya at malikot niyang paggalaw ay humina... akala namin okay na... sobrang taranta na namin at late na na may nakapagsabi sa amin na kakilala na bakit walang neurologist si papa. kailangan daw niya neuro. late rin namin nalaman na cardio and internist doctors lang humahawak kay papa. before that, tanong na kami nang tanong sa mga nurses. nagtanong pa kami bakit hindi pa ict-scan si papa dahil nanghina siya. ang sabi, hindi na raw kailangan daw lalabas na siya. binawasan din mga gamot niya. kaso ang sabi nagka-infection daw siya sa dugo dahil hindi mawala ang lagnat niya kay binigyan siya ng antibiotics. thursday nang malaman namin na walang neuro si papa at kailangan niya ng neuro. pinilit namin na ipatingin si papa sa neuro kahit na nagagalit na samin mga nurses. cardio raw ang kailangan ni papa at hindi neuro. pinapirma kami ng waiver na kami ang nag-ask for neuro at hindi ang doctor ni papa. turns out, nang icheck siya ng neuro bakit daw hindi na-ct scan agad. dapat 2-3 days na ct scan daw ulit para malaman kung namaga utak ni papa. mali pa raw ang antibiotics na ibinibigay kay papa, sobrang baba raw dapat daw malakas dahil sa utak nga daw ang problema ni papa. thursday night, bumagsak katawan ni papa. ang gcs niya from 10 nang dinala namin siya sa ospital to 3. kumalat na daw ang dugo sa utak ni papa as per result ng ct scan sabi ng neuro niya baka kailanganin niya ng surgery. that night, sobrang bumaba bp niya, naging abnormal heartbeat niya at super nahirapan siyang huminga nilagyan na siya ng tube. super sakit akala namin makakauwi na siya tapos friday ng madaling araw nawala na siya. super sakit, before siya mastroke pinag-uusapan pa lang namin graduation ko. sabi niya super proud siya sa amin magkakapatid. ngayon hindi na niya ako makikitang ggraduate....yung panganay niya, walang tatay sa graduation. hindi ko alam kung may pagkukulang mga doctors niya or what, until now di pa rin namin nassettle ang bill. ang hirap magsalita kasi di naman kami expert pero para sa akin may pagkukulang sila. hindi ko sila sinisisi pero ang sama-sama ng loob ko!!! may times na parang okay na, pero kapag naaalala ko si papa... ang sakit-sakit, sobrang miss ko na siya. sobrang miss ko na ang papa ko. unang anak niya na mapapagraduate niya ng college, hindi niya makikita... kahit na mahirap, pinag-aaral niya kaming apat. ang sakit-sakit pa rin... hindi ko alam paano magccope up sa pagkawala ni papa...",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/14hwjjn/paano_kayo_nagccope_up_sa_pagkawala_ng_mahal/,24 06 2023

Beware of PNEUMONIA,"as a father of 3...akala ko expert na ko sa lahat ng sakit ng bata. hindi namin dinadala sa hospital kasi mababa lang naman lagnat at pawala wala pa. hindi sya nag tatae so hindi din dehydrated. we ruled out dengue and amoeba as well. little did we know, our little one is having rsv na pala. common ubo't sipon (na usong uso ngayon) pero sa lungs ang atake and pneumonia agad. he's only 3yrs old, pandemic baby so hindi sanay sa tao.. imagine leaving him alone sa icu surrounded by nurses and doctors he doesn't know.. it's heartbreaking. symtoms ang things to look out/do for so you can avoid our mistakes: - nose flaring - tignan ang tyan kung may struggle sa pag hinga - if you have o2 finger reader mas okay - a simple online consultation with your doctor sana would suffice, antibiotics lang sana sapat na - we are self employed so walang hmo, get some one time er use card or something.. or apply for your own hmo kahit sa mga bata lang - mag pa flu shot na buong pamilya pag flu season just today, i found out about a colleague who passed away due to rsv pneumonia as well 😢 he was younger than me.",https://i.redd.it/iz1b02gq3m4c1.jpg,6 12 2023
"May nag post regarding sa Mcdo issue na sinigawan ang Manager. Today, napahiya ako sa sinabi ng isang tao who also happened to by employee. What to do?","i'm currently the general manager of a small company (with a total of 14 employees including me). nag papasuyo sana ako sa isang employee ko na mag pabili sa store since lalabas din siya to buy something. hindi rin naman ako makalabas as i was currently working on something during that time. however, medyo napahiya lang ako dahil bigla siyang bumanat ng ""ay hindi na ako lalabas"" tatlong beses niyang sinabi yon. then, ""ray, hindi na ako lalabas, hindi na nga"" pertaining to the first person na nagpasuyo. all of the employees on the production area heard it and started to laugh. i felt embarrassed, disrespected, napatahimik ako. then bigla siya nag tanong kung ano daw ba ang ipapasuyo ko. my anger get the better of me and blurted: ""hindi na, hindi na ako magpapasuyo, ayaw na ayaw ko sa lahat yung binabastos ako ng ganon"". then, he went his way out to the store. pumasok lang sa isip ko na pwede naman sigurong siyang humindi ng maayos to add more context: \- we all leave in the same apartment (converted and company-provided) though being a manager, i have my own room whereas the employees share rooms. \- the production area is just below/beside the apartment. (separate unit) \- yung employee is off-duty. but, my request was non-work. kumbaga, nakiusap ako, tao sa tao. \- we kind of treat each other as friends within and outside working hours. i've been a general manager for this company for more than 2 years already and this was the first time i felt embarrassed by a person who also happened to be my employee. i just wanted to handle this thing professionally. what is my goal? \- ayaw ko maging habit sa mga employees na okay lang ma bastos ako. \- i want to be the bigger person especially being the general manager. \- i want to confront the person na hindi okay ang ginawa niya without sounding petty dahil hindi lang ako napagbigyan. nanginginig pa laman ko dahil sa galit while typing this, it just happened 15 minutes ago.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/162fnb7/may_nag_post_regarding_sa_mcdo_issue_na_sinigawan/,27 08 2023

My thanksgiving dinner experience with a BBM family.,"so eto nga guys, nag-punta kami (me (f), my wife (f) my sister and her bf) reluctantly sa invitation ng ilocano-bbm tita na kapit-bahay namin. may pinag-samahan naman yung family kahit papano, before elections super ganda ng communication namin sa kanila kasi kapitbahay namin dito sa canada. saktong usapan lang, nag-dasal kami bago kumain. to be honest, ang ganda nung prayer. as an agnostic, na-appreciate ko naman siya. pero gagi, yung kapatid ko brining-up yung pag-unfriend ko sa tito ko na misogynistic bbm supporter din tapos sabi sakin bigla nung bbm na tita: ""kayo kasi maka-leni kayong lahat diba? dapat di na kayo nagpapa-niwala sa kwento kwento lang. dapat sa totoong news sources lang."" mind you, binigyan ko lang siya nuon ng heads-up na fake yung website source niya (halatang fake kasi no actual sources from credible organizations, news sites, people, also the ones she sent me usually walang https:// (unsecure-doesnt mean all with https:// are legit as well) tapos yung design nung buong site, parang cult na may agila, illuminati sht - web designer and dev ako) tapos kinimkim pala niya yun. di ko nalang tinuloy yung pag-rebut ko kasi yung wife ko natatakot na magalit ako. i was very polite about it kasi mas matanda siya sakin and i was just looking out for her. then na-bring up nanaman ng kapatid ko about yung recently nangyari kay leila de lima. gagi nagulat ako sabi ng panganay niyang babae, ""dapat pinatay na nila yun. tinuluyan na dapat sinaksak."" sabay silang pamilyang tumawa (aside sa bunso na awkward sa situation) i felt chills. paanong nakakapag-dasal ng ganun kaganda tapos without any hesitations, would wish harm on other people just like that. ps. sinabihan din nung bbm tita yung mom ko directly bakit ako nag-cocomment and nag-popost na kumakalaban sa views niya. tas sabi ni bbm tita ""isang post mo nalang eh sasampalin na kita."" sabay tawa. eto din isang kinagalit ko sila yung traditional toxis filipino family. lakas nilang i-body shame yung asawa ko sa harap ko? muntik na talaga nag-liparan ang mga lumpia. anyways, officially cut ties with them na. may bbm supporter akong mga kakilala pero not that extreme (madalas dahil lang kasi ilocano. &nbsp; &nbsp; (edit) just to answer some questions. &nbsp; > quote q1. why was politics bough up nung dinner? i did not want to talk about politics because i knew it was going to be a mess, pero my sister thought our casual arguments sa fb nuon nung tita is civil and casual. she thought wrong. she had no idea the tita was extremely pro-marcos. she tried to change the topic but we decided na umalis bago magka-gulo (because i get really unpleasant pag nasimulan ko nang magalit and isa yun sa puna ng wife ko sakin kaya ayaw ko siya lalo ma-stress) anywho, lesson learned sa kapatid ko lol &nbsp; >quote q2. di bako sumagot or stoop up for what i believe in? i tried. di sa pag-tanggol sa pagkatalo or sa binoto ko, pero sa misinformation na nagbblur sa totoo at hindi. ang sagot sakin ""naniniwala ka kasi sa fake news. dun ka sa totoong balita lang. wag sa kwento kwento sa facebook at tiktok."" can't argue with people who always things they're right. siya nag-banggit na kay leni kami nag-vote last election and my side of the family all nodded (said ""yes. syempre tita."") then she proceeded to complain about the philippines being poor right now and then overcompensating sa pag-puri kay bbm after niya magreklamo. lol also i don't ever want to stoop low para makipag-sampalan at murahan sa harap nung bunso nila (na awkwardly listening to her mom talk about marcos. i guess she's the ""odd"" one in the family.) &nbsp; >quote q3. but they body-shamed your wife? di ka pumatol? as mentioned i can become harsh pag galit ako. my wife doesn't like me when i'm at that point of anger kaya we just looked at each other and signaled na umalis na. although i told them my wife is building strength kasi nag-ddeadlift siya. di nila alam ata kung ano yun. tbh nung tumahimik ako, napansin nung bf ng sister ko and akala daw nila may gagawin ako. i'm honestly surprised i held it in like that. i'm quite proud of myself. charot &nbsp; >quote q4. important ba sila sa inyo? nung bago-bago palang kami sa canada isa yung tita na nagshashare ng food niya samin sa work, nag-lolook out for us and genuinely concerned if we were okay. kaya masakit din na this happened. &nbsp; >quote q5. anong nangyari sa fresh lumpia? binigyan kami ng pa-take home pero wala na gusto kumain. binalik ko yung plate nila kahapon pero di ko na kinausap. iniwan ko nalang sa pinto nila. &nbsp; &nbsp; >quote edit: clarified that not all websites with ""https://"" are legit din.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/y1fwdi/my_thanksgiving_dinner_experience_with_a_bbm/,11 10 2022

"Ridiculous ""tips"" from a supposed immigration officer has been making rounds on Facebook.","kailangan mo ba talaga magdala ng yearbook? 🥇 from diy travel philippines group ********** hi, i’m posting again as promised. been with the bureau for a decade now, been assigned to different ports as well. disclaimer: everything you will read in this post are all about my personal experiences sa counter. you’re free to compare me from ios you have encountered, but i will not engage in negative comments or bashing.☺️ also, you cannot use this post as basis na ma clear kayo sa immig counters because everything will be based on the totality of circumstance on the day of your travel. also sa mga ios na makakabasa neto, bahala na kayo to check on yourselves. this is how i perform my job. you’re welcome to make this a big deal, raise your eyebrows, shrug or follow some of my procedures. hahaha whichever. so here comes nothing! first time travelers: 1.) dress comfortably and appropriately. why? because yes, your attire matters. judgemental talaga kami, guys. (hindi ko naman nilalahat🤣) comfortably= yung parang mag chichill ka lng with friends (shirt, jeans, sneakers, perhaps a jacket) bsta hindi yung prang rarampa ka sa stage or mag didinner with heart e. avoid heels, pls. nakakapagod tumakbo sa airport especially pag final call na. a legit or frequent traveller knows this kaya mostly, nka flats yan cla or sneakers. approriately means, nka depende to sa country of destination mo. example, singapore yung ticket mo, pero destination mo talaga is dubai and ayaw mong malaman to ni io. pero kasi, december alis mo, winter sa dubai, mej malamig, nka jacket ka na may furfur. char. eh hndi namin malamig sa singapore. so ma o-offload ka just because of the jacket?😭 diba? do the math. pro tip: pag 1st time to travel abroad, book like a 3d2n trip muna then bring a 10-15kg of clothes. iwasan muna ang change outfit na mga 100 times.😑 bcs the heavier your luggage is, the more suspish you become. the shorter your travel dates, the more legit you look as a tourist. 2.) if traveling alone, sa queue pa lng, take slow and paced breaths. calm down, stop checking your phone every minute. why? kasi kaming mga officers, even though we conduct inspections in an enclosed counters, we are particular of the demeanor ng mga na sa pila namin. we profile you kahit na sa queue ka pa lng. everything, from your shoes, to your bags up to how you behave yourself. we don’t do this to outbound filipinos alone, we also do the same strategy sa mga foreigners coming in. also, if you keep on checking your phone, i have this presumption na may kausap ka for instructions. usually kasi, mga victims ng human trafficking, may kausap yan, coaching them every step of the way hanggang makalusot sa counter. if i see you fidgeting with your phone, i already have a prejudice towards you. refer kita for secondary inspection. also, using of electronic devices is prohibited sa immigration area. if traveling with a group, queue properly. wag mag chismis sa pila or talk too loud because you are contributing to the noise pollution around you. and yung strangers na kasabay nyo sa pila, naiingayan din sa inyo. hahaha 3.) do not, i said, do not place your printed docs sa plastic or brown envelop tapos hahawakan nyo. no. please don’t. put all your documents inside your bag. hindi kayo mag aapply ng work, i personally dont want to see a legit tourist na may hawak na envelop. huhu that envelop for me is already a screaming red flag. and pag may need ka e-abot sa officer, remove it from any concealed envelop. kasi baka may pera ka na naiwan sa loob and the officer might feel insulted with it, baka akalain bribe money.🤭 4.) while nka pila, just hold your passport, remove mo yung passport jacket ksi it wont fit in our scanners. and may mga nahuhulog from your jacket inserts tapos kasalanan pa namin pag nawala.nkklk🤣 anyway, hold your passports, insert your departure card and your boarding pass in any page of your passport, kng may visa ka, dun mo e-insert na page. at yan lng ang ibigay mo pag dating mo sa counter ni io. nothing more, nothing less. pag may hinanap sayo, dat’s the time you present your printed docs or ids. pag hindi, do not proactively present. 5.) re: phone check we are legally armed and protected to do this. your rights to privacy is suspended sa borders, whether outbound or inbound. personally for me, hanggang convo and pictures lang ako. and i don’t do the scrolling and never ko hinahawak ang phone. i would ask the passenger to do the scrolling, photo gallery, convo. i don’t check bank accounts, i am a bit uncomfortable with the thot of checkin people’s money. and tbh, wala akong kakilala or nakasabay na officer on my shift that checks online bank accounts. printed, yes meron, kasi embassies also ask for bank statements, if we apply for visas. and those saying na may printed copies naman bakit mag checheck pa ng email. well, you wouldnt believe what people can fraudulently do just to present coes. or fabricate company ids pra mapaniwala kami na employed siya dito. 6.) for males specifically. disclaimer: this is my personal discretion. let’s say, your profile is a family man, meaning, you have a wife and kids here in ph, you’re traveling alone for a holiday. or to just visit a family member abroad, you think maniniwala kami? mag eenjoy ka kaya without your family with you?🥺 our initial judgement will be, you will work there. and there is nothing wrong with that. pro tip: when the officer asks you the reason for travel, and kung totoo naman talaga dat you have a relative abroad within 4th degree, you can say that you will visit the relative and say “at kung may mahanap na trabaho po dun, baka may chance po na mag ta-trabaho dun” i am not saying this will guarantee you can get thru that counter, but i personally appreciate an honest answer and i will gladly stamp your passport knowing you are doing what it takes for your family. hindi namin kami heartless, guys.❤️ p.s i only apply this to male travelers but never to females. why? because women and children, as study shows, are more prone to human trafficking incidents. that’s reality. this is not discrimination. and i stand firm on this kasi hindi ko kinaya when i encountered an abused filipina who was sent home from saudi. hindi sya makausap ng matino as in sobrang traumatic nangyari sa kanya. she pretended to be a tourist bound for hk but jumped to ksa, instead. for previously offloaded: 1.) bring as much as possible yung hiningi ng io sayo when you were offloaded. don’t simply base your experience with someone else’s kasi hndi talaga kayo 100% the same situation. even sa akin, minsan, i would vouch for a friend na aalis ng bansa, may times na napapayagan, meron ding times na hindi talaga. and halos the same lng naman ang situation, it so happened na by the book c io, meaning kung ano yung rules, the officer sticks and adheres to it kasi yun naman talaga ang dapat. may times lng na kagaya ko na mejo relaxed yung approach sa rules, maybe it goes with age or tagal sa work. depende. but you know, everything happens for a reason. for freelancers: i wouldn’t mind if you don’t have your itr, what’s important are your ✔️ticket ✔️hotel booking ✔️coe with compensation ✔️simple itinerary, yung gawa mo for family traveling together: immediate family only for example: father, mother, kids, you may queue in one counter. isama mo na lng din or paunahin mo na yung grandparents then you stand behind them. yung kapatid mo na may sariling, pamilya, hayaan mong mag queue din separately. pero kng mag-isa lng sya, den by all means, isabay mo. hold all passports together tas before mo ibagay sa officer, ask mo muna kung okay lng na buong angkan nyo ang magpapa clear sa kanya. we’re usually not that strict pag family. pro tip: if previously offloaded ka, malaki ang possibility na makakaalis ka if kasama mo family mo. of course, you’ll be interviewed again just so may mailagay kmi sa system to justify your travel, pero 90%, goods ka na. kaya, isama ang buong pamilya pra masaya! i have seen a comment pala na nonsense dw ang question ni io na “bakit doon ang punta mo?” (referring to the country of destination.) this is answerable by either, you have family there, you’re meeting a friend, you wanted to see a spot you’ve seen in a movie, you wanted to try something na sikat dun sa country. diba? possibilities are endless. so dont be sarcastic and say on your mind na “eh dun gusto ko eh, pakialam mo ba.” we would ask this to gauge your knowledge of the place you’re supposed to visit. paano pala kung singapore yung ticket mo tapos gusto mo mag disney land? eh universal studios lng meron cla dun. nasa hk ung dl.😑 if may friend ka na io, if ka-close mo talaga, message mo na before your flight (hindi kami manghihingi ng pasalubong, pramisssss😂) at kung legit nman tlaga na mag to-tour ka lng.. wag na wag ka mag mi-message asking for help pag na offload ka na kasi yung record mo nasa system na, hassle makipag usap just to clear your records, guys. hindi lahat ng nasa airport ay taga bureau of immigration, so if you have bad experience with other employees, wag nyo namin kami e-blame just because kami yung last na nakausap nyo.😅🥹 be courteous and respectful at all times. we appreciate those mababait na passengers and well-mannered kasi marami talaga ang rude and feeling entitled. well, it goes both ways din nman. meron din mga ios na ganto.🤭🙈 share it to help more peeps. save this post as well. enjoy your travel.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/121xioi/ridiculous_tips_from_a_supposed_immigration/,25 03 2023

Free healthcare for animals on Barangay Health Centers,"so, yesterday i lost my dog. nadala na namin sya sa vet, ilang beses na pero hindi sya gumaling. gusto pa sana sya dalhin ni mama sa vet para ipagamot kaso wala na syang pera. naubos na sa mga gamot and gatas ng aso namin. i know hindi sana kami nag alaga ng aso if we are struggling financially pero bigay lang sya sa amin and first dog namin sya. tapos ayon, naisip ko lang, meron bang free healthcare for animals dito sa bansa natin? or if wala, bakit? may pros and cons ba? i'm genuinely curious. naiisip kaya ng ibang mga nasa posisyon yon? hindi ba pwedeng magkaroon ng ganon sa mga health centers? or dito lang sa amin wala? para ka na rin palang nagka anak kapag nag-alaga ka ng aso, kailangan emotionally and financially stable hahshah",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/182k6nv/free_healthcare_for_animals_on_barangay_health/,24 11 2023

Sino ang mas kawawa? Magulang o Anak?,"i agree: 1. both biktima ng sistema ng lipunan o ng kultura ng kahirapan 2. both pwedeng magkamali sa desisyon sa buhay 3. both biktima ng pagpapasa ng kultura 4. both merong utak at puso na pwedeng magkamali. i cannot put it into words dahil sobrang personal sa akin neto pero tanong ko lang sa magulang dito o magbabalak mag anak sino ba ang mas kawawa ang magulang or anak? kapag nag desisyon na bumuhay ng bata ang isang couple, automatically magulang na sila, whether they are capable or not, they decided to have a child. pero sa lipunan nating ito, laging talo ang anak. wala namang kamuwang muwang ang bata at higit sa lahat hindi namilit na buhayin sa mundong ito, magulang ang nag desisyon na mag anak pero bakit sila pa din ang kawawa? kawawa sila palagi lalo na sa media portrayal kaya lahat tayo na condition na ganon, laging superior ang magulang sa lahat ng bagay, lagi silang kawawa, lagi silang dapat intindihin, lagi sila dapat bigyan ng pagmamahal, hindi ko maintindihan. nakaka awa lang na hanggang ngayon hindi pa rin mabago yan, example na lang sa mini miss u, may mga bata na naaawa sa magulang nila dahil napapagod magtrabaho, gusto na nilang magtrabaho para makatulong sa magulang nila, hindi ba nakaka gago yun na ipinapakita nila sa anak nila na napapagod sila dahil sa anak nila??? na iniisip ng bata na pabigat sila sa magulang nila??? eh hindi naman ang bata ang nag desisyon na mabuhay siya sa mundong ito kundi ang magulang niya? oo na sige na, sistema na may problema pero maaayos ba agad yan? wala bang mga utak o puso ang mga magulang na ito para maisip nila na desisyon nila mag anak pero pinaparamdam o pinapakita nila sa anak nila na mahirap mabuhay dahil sa anak nila? ang anak laging masama ang edit kapag ka humiwalay, nag decide magpamilya , inuna ang sarili, laging susumbatan ng magulang na pinakain, pinalaki sila neto , pinag aral — eh aba dapat lang kasi responsibilidad mo yun bilang magulang? bakit ganyan yung ibang magulang parang nag anak lang para pagkakitaan o para may mag alaga sa kanila sa pag tanda. hindi ba may buhay din yang mga anak? bakit laging kawawa ang mga magulang??? in the first place naman sila nag decide na bumuhay ng bata, kung nahihirapan sila consequence na yun ng desisyon nila? para sa akin, tama na yang paawa edit, kasalanan mo yan kasi nag anak ka?? hindi ko magets yung edit sa media, na parang utang na loob pa ng bata na nabuhay siya, na parang pinilit niya yung magulang na ipanganak siya?? nag anak lang ba ang mga magulang kasi wala silang pangarap sa buhay? nag anak lang ba sila para may mag alaga sa kanila? nag anak lang ba sila dahil sa pressure ng lipunan? pero isa pa rin yang desisyon? at kung ano mang consequence niyan e own up to it?? hindi yung papaawa ka sa ibang tao, sa tv shows, sa radio shows at maski sa harap ng anak mo para magkaroon ng utang na loob sayo at maawa sayo? hindi ko siya maput into words dahil nga personal kong na experience to e , yung pag mamanipula ng magulang, yung pagpaparamdam sa akin na kasalanan ko kung bakit nahihirapan sila, kasalanan ko kung bakit wala kaming makaen, pisikal at verbal abuse ang naranasan ko masakit man o hindi abuso yun para sa akin , at naranasan ko lahat ito mula bata hanggang sa paglaki, nakwento ko na din to sa mga close friends ko pero para sa kanila normal lang daw yun kaya naisantabi ko yung feelings ko. normal na pala na matawag na palamunin kahit bata ka palang. kaya nung nagkatrabaho ako, sobrang saya ko na makatulong pero nung may nabasa ako somewhere dun ako nagising sa katotohanan na, hindi ko dapat naranasan yun kasi bata lang ako that time. umiiyak ako habang tinatype to, si oa pala to eh haha. tumigil sa pagtatrabaho yung tatay ko nung nagkatrabaho na ako, edi malamang ako na naging breadwinner malamang sa malamang di lang ako nakakaranas neto, kaya nung nagising ako dun na bumalik lahat ng alaala ko nung bata ako, na akala ko normal lang yun pala hindi. hindi dapat. tumutulong ako kasi walang choice, kung hindi ako tutulong walang tutulong sa kanila kasi hindi na bila kaya tulungan sarili nila. o diba kawawa na naman sila. pero kelan magiging kawawa ang mga anak na nagsantabi ng pangarap sa buhay, ng oras, ng pamumuhay magisa, ng pagkakaroon ng karanasan katulad ng mga taong may matitinong magulang, kelannn??? hindi lang ako nakaranas neto dahil sigurado ako marami ding naging forced na maging breadwinner sila pero lagi pa ding kawawa edit ang mga magulang sa media portrayal, maski sa lipunan natin, kelan magkakaroon ng narrative na ""ayan anak pa more, alam mong hindi mo kaya nag anak ka pa, ngayon papa awa kang nahihirapan"" like.... hindi pa ba abuso na bubuo ka ng anak knowing na hindi mo kaya?... sa lipunang ito, sa ekonomiyang ito? nakakasawa na at lubos na nakakalungkot makarinig sa mga bata sa tv na kaya sila sumasali sa contest para makatulong sa magulang. hindi ba nahiya tong mga magulang na pinapakita nila sa mga bata yung paghihirap nila? fcking fake it. maawa ka sa bata, ipinaparamdam mo na mahirap ang buhay dahil sa kanya, at kelangan ka bigyan ng award dahil sa paghihirap mo, eh kung pwede namang hindi ka mahirapan kung hindi ka nag decide mag anak. gets ko na may problema sa sistema, pero maaayos banagad yan? hindi talaga pwede sisihin yung magulang sa desisyon nila? nakakainis yung ibang pa woke sa twitter na sasabihin na problema sa sistema yan kaya ganyan ang mga magulang? like so okay lang mang abuso kasi kasalanan ng sistema, hindi talaga sila pwede sisihin sa katangahang desisyon na ginawa nila???? ewan ko, mapa media, mapa woke. laging kawawa ang magulang , laging kelangan may bigger understanding ang mga anak sa magulang ""hindi mo maiintindihan kasi hindi ka pa nagiging magulang"" like bitch may utak ako and i'm in the right mind not to have a child knowing na im not financially capable para buhayin sila i can only speak for myself, for what i experienced, kung ano nakikita ko sa tv at kung ano response ng kaibigan ko sa karanasan ko, and by all of that, it only means na normal lang to pero hindi talaga dapat siya normal. tl;dr media portrayal affects the thinking of filipinos na nakaka awa ang magulang and it is love to be abusive towards children na forced sila to be a breadwinner and maging caregiver sa magulang dahil sa reponsibilities ng magulang masked as sacrifices. this normalizes the abusive culture at dynamics ng magulang at ng anak. hindi nakaka awa ang mga magulang, desisyon nilang mag anak kaya kung mahirapan man sila dapat di sila mag pa awa. mas nakaka awa ang mga anak na hindi naman nila desisyong mabuhay pero mag susuffer sila sa lipunang ito dahil sa desisyon ng magulang nila. knowing this, sino ang mas nakaka awa? magulang o anak?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/15rkqrq/sino_ang_mas_kawawa_magulang_o_anak/,15 08 2023

Managed to leave the country and thought: what in the actual h*ll is wrong with the Philippines,"hello r/philippines! i have left the philippines. this is a post about my disillusionment in the past while living there. brief context: i made a few posts in the past here in the past about a lot of bad stuff that was happening in my life (e.g. my narc pinoy parents filing a false kidnapping report in case i leave the house, and my doubts on if a psychiatrist will actually help me or not if i go to them about my issues) but things have taken a good turn and i have finally managed to leave the country by marrying my dual citizen s/o living abroad (not going to say which country for anonymity reasons). living abroad, i experienced a lot of things that i thought was impossible. here's a few: * i'm earning 100k php a month for an entry-level job. they didn't even ask me to have a bachelor's degree, a pleasing personality and 50 valid ids. * public offices take 20-40 minutes to process documents. i got a resident id on the same day. * the mental health industry actually wants to help me with my mental health conditions (the psychiatrist told me to try consulting with a psychologist first because he warned me that the medications may have unwanted irreversible effects). * my workmates are actually supportive and seek to see me succeed! they said i'm their most promising workmate and they want me to be their manager in the future. * i'm more comfortable opening up to people, they judge me less and they're more inquisitive/open-minded about the things i've went through and my life decisions. * they don't force me into any social interactions. i'm not forced to participate in any social gatherings if i don't wish to. * people are generally more respectful of my boundaries. * i'm not compared to anyone else. * i'm not shamed for my hobbies. * the system doesn't work against me. now, the typical response is to absorb all of this and say ""i'll forget about the shit i went through, i'm finally here where i want to be and am appreciated,"" right? to be honest, i'm disillusioned. why? well, first, i gave my parents a second chance and then stopped going no-contact with them after i finally went abroad. i told them how i was doing and the response i got was: ""edi waw."" ""sana all."" ""sana andiyan ka para saamin."" ""bigyan mo na kami para patawarin namin mga taon na hindi ka nagusap saamin."" ""inisip mo ba yung mga kapatid mo sa ginagawa mo?"" they weren't happy for my achievements. i thought they would finally put behind all those years of abuse i went through from their narcissism, but no, they're bitter that i stopped talking to them because they won't let me move out on their terms. i did what i couldn't before: i gave them my genuine feelings about their response, and told them to not expect any more contact from me in the future. they went, ""sige ka maawa ka saamin."" then i realized, what if i hit them where it hurts? i told them that i will not be sending them any money either anytime in the future. that's when they went ballistic. ""wala kng kwentang anak"" ""ganyan ka sa lahat ginawa namin para sayo?"" ""sinakripisyo kami lahat para sayo"" i told them i don't care. they threatened legal action against me, my s/o, and my s/o's family. i told them ""lol"" then blocked them after. that's something that i never would've done if not for me deciding to take the leap to leave the country. i don't regret my interactions with my parents, but i'm disillusioned with the years i spent in the philippines. i felt like all the years i spent there could've been prevented and avoided by simply not living there. i actually regret being born in into a toxic family within the philippines. then i remembered the things i went through: * i tried to apply for a job that paid 15k per month, but they chose this beauty pageant winner (who allegedly has no job, internship or volunteer experience) even though they said that i have a very promising, experienced resume (i have three internships and a lot of volunteer experience) and that i'm practically good for the job. * to this day i still don't have my national id lmao. i got a fixer for a driver's license, got the bs ""temporary driver's license"" which was literally printed on a piece of a4 paper, and used that for my passport. i don't even know how to drive lmao, i just did that for passport requirements (don't worry, i'm taking driving school in the country i'm currently in!) * i went to a psychiatrist in the philippines, told them all the shit they went through, and said ""we don't believe you, we'll send a social worker to your house to confirm the situation"" even though i already moved out and had evidence of my parents filing false kidnapping charges. plus they gave me a number to call for a comprehensive mental health examination, but the person answering the number was ""disoriented"" or something (probably on drugs? i'm not sure), said they'd call back, but never called back lol. * all my ""friends"" were jealous of my resume right after we graduated, then constantly tried to one-up me by pushing the fact that they got employed sooner than me into my face. jokes on them; i'm working 40 hours a week and getting 100k a month while they have a lot of unpaid overtime and night shift differentials while they slave away in call centers. * whenever i opened up to people about my life story, people typically say ""pero pamilya mo parin sila"", ""hindi ka ba naawa sa mga kapatid mo?"", ""kahit ganyan ginagawa nila sayo, kausapin mo rin sila"". thanks for the unsolicited advice, but i genuinely do not feel safe with parents who tried to file a false kidnapping case on me. * palagi akong pinilit magsama sa mga party, outing, etc. may beses na hindi ako nagsama, pero tinawagan akong ""suplado"", ""masungit"", ""mataray"", ""mayabang"", ""matapobre"" (wtf), etc. * may isang beses na nagsumbong yung ex-friend ko sa magulang ko kung asan ako nakatira. ex-friend said this was an attempt for my parents to ""fix their relationship with me"". i had to stay in my s/o's house in the province, and i had to revoke my contract with my landlord at the time. i still feel bad for my landlord, but i found him a new tenant myself to make up for it. * palagi akong kinompara sa mga pinsan ko. kinompara din ako sa mga batchmate ko. they said ""buti nalang si person x ganyan, may kwenta sila. gayahin mo yan, wag kang maging walang kwenta."" * i was shamed for doing art commissions to earn money, especially my parents. they said ""kapag yan ginagawa mo, gugutom ka. dapat nagnursing, engineering, accounting, o law ka nalang"". i was also shamed for my other hobbies like photography, traveling, anime, learning japanese, theater (this one hurt; i applied to join the philippine educational theater association, but my parents sabotaged my application by stopping it from reaching the interviewers), etc. * the whole time i lived in the philippines... i felt like the system was against me. it tried to make me into someone i wasn't. it was forcing me to become someone who sacrificed everything for others, while not being given anything in return, and to base my worth as a person on my profession, my income, and how much ""support"" i'm giving to my family. thus comes the thought, what in the actual h\*ll is wrong with the philippines? if anyone is going through something similar to me, i hope my story can help you be confident about being yourself. it's not that you're wrong for being different, you're simply in the wrong place that doesn't accept you. you don't have to leave the country. find others going through the same thing you are, and distance yourself from the people that drag you down.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/16tzqab/managed_to_leave_the_country_and_thought_what_in/,27 09 2023

Wanna share some positive experiences with your parents growing up?,"fully aware of the pinoy parent stereotype and tropes. naging parte na ng psyche nating mga pinoy yung generational trauma, bad parenting tropes like ginawagawang retirement plan or emotional fullfillment ang anak, or super strict parents nung teenage years na biglang nagdedemand ng apo in their 20s, or yung common occurrence yung sigawan sa loob ng bahay. mas middle ground ako sa ganito, minsan nakaka-relate ako pero minsan hindi talaga ako nakakarelate at all (pero aware ako na common experience siya sa maraming pinoy). for instance, nakakarelate naman talaga yung striktong nanay na nagbibigay ng curfew. daming beses na naming nagtalo ng mama ko about curfew at bantayan pag-inom ko pag kasama ang barkada, pero never naman akong sheltered sa bahay na di pinapayagan lumabas. makulit lang siya na palaging may reminder pero ganun naman talaga ang nanay. kahit nung nasa late 20s na ako, tapos sila mismo nagsasabi sa'kin na di ko kailangan mag-anak agad. imbis na gawin kaming retirement plan ng magulang namin, inaassure kami na ""nak, di mo kailangan mag-alala sa'min pagtanda. covered kami ng insurance. basta bisitahin mo kami pag tumira na kami sa probinsya"". on the contrary, kami pa yung ineencourage mag-ipon at mag-invest. kahit yung dad ko, walang trace of machismo at all. payag siyang maging butt of the joke sa mga meal time namin. stereotypical dad siya yes, in the sense na marunong mag-karpintero, mag-ayos ng kuryente at tubo, may green thumb sa gardening. pero di kasama sa stereotype yung sexism at homophobia, baka kasi prof din dad ko. never kong nadinig doon yung mga linyang ""lalaki ka, dapat ganito"" other than dapat maging responsableng tao ako (pero sinasabi niya rin yun sa sister ko). since pareho din kaming prof, mga nerd history stuff mga pinag-uusapan namin madalas, siya din kasi parang uncle iroh na mahilig magbigay ng life lesson. nagagalit din naman siya pero bihira; tamang amount lang ng pinapagalitan ako pero sa mga pagkakataong gano'n gets ko agad kung bakit. at napakabihira ko silang nakikitang mag-away. siguro in a 3-year span, dalawang beses. i almost feel bad kasi andami kong friends na di gaanong magkasundo magulang nila, tapos marami-rami rin yung hiwalay yung magulang at may resentment. sa magulang ko, ramdam na ramdam mo na gusto pa rin nila company ng isa't isa kahit pushing 60 na sila pareho: sabay mag-meryenda kahit nagphophone lang pareho, di nauubusan ng kwento sa isa't isa, tapos malambing pa rin.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/15pnpb3/wanna_share_some_positive_experiences_with_your/,13 08 2023

PBA mirrors most of the things wrong in our society,"i just saw this news that pba, the country's ""best"" basketball league, is taking actions to prevent the ""poaching"" of filipino players to other asian leagues. for those not subscribed to ph basketball, since 2020, there seem to be a start of the diaspora of filipino players to other asian leagues in japan, korea, and taiwan. these players are imports and are very good ones- they can constitute a national team pool. i just thought that pba's move shows their incompetence and their care for the clubs more than the players. pretty much same with ph politics that the admin favors the cronies more than the people. imagine stopping someone from getting a better paying job because you don't do you job well. crab mentality, right? nakakainis lang na puta, lahat tayo naghahanapbuhay pero pipigilan mo kasi nahihirapan yung favorites mo? wtf. majority of the clubs are under the smc or the mvp group, and these clubs basically moves under the table to get the best best players in the league, leaving the others on independent ones. they do not reveal player salaries probably kasi mahuhuli na yung bigger market teams gives a lot more. lack of transparency possibly leads to corruption. i mean ilang beses na nagkaroon ng star player - bench player ""trades"" sa pba? pba players might also have some toxic masculinity culture, probably more elaborated on the wuwjs podcast. the gist is it is an org run by ""dinosaur men"" preventing it to become a more progressive org. they don't stand against national issues as much as nba does e.g. black lives matter. they also show the ""ex- presidential partner / executive assistant senator"" a lot. pba x politics - james yap as councilor, san juan probably has a mythical five in their political lineup este munisipyo. not to undermine the individuals pero retirement move lagi ng mga ex-pba ang pulitika. not surprised to see pba players doing the ""fist sign"" or being closely affiliated with politicians (corrupt ones probbably). paano ka uunlad kung naghahalal tayo ng mga tao kasi sya favorite player mo nung bata ka? imagine na sa paboritong palaro ng mga pilipino, ganyan ang pamamalakad, paano pa sa bansa? putanginang basketball association yan.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/xh2qbu/pba_mirrors_most_of_the_things_wrong_in_our/,18 09 2022

"We lost contact with our mom, who works as an overseas Filipino worker in Riyadh","tl;dr: we have not heard anything from our mom for four days and we are worried about her safety. i reached out to her agency but there’s no update yet about her situation there. hello , i am the oldest son and just wanted to get this off my chest. i am currently a 3rd yr student and masyado akong na-busy last week gawa't midterms namin yon. last tuesday, napansin ko na hindi na tumatawag or nagchachat si mama at nakita ko na hindi siya talaga nag o-online. nagtaka na ko at sinubukan kong siyang i-message pero walang reply. ang last convo namin at last activity niya sa fb niya ay nung saturday pa. nag sabi na ko sa so ko at sabi niya we'll call owwa tom if wala pa rin response si mama that day. kinabuksan, tinawagan ko na ang owwa at binigay naman ang cellphone number ng agency ni mama para matawagan at i-raise ang concern. tinawagan ko pero walang sumasagot so nag iwan lang ako ng message. later that night, nag reply naman at sinabing ipapaabot daw nila sa foreign recruitment agency (fra). kinabukasan (today), nag send na ng message ang agency ni mama sa fra this morning at nag reply naman ang fra na they will check with the employer at babalikan daw ang agency kapag may update na. we were all so worried na to the point na si tita, nataranta na at tinawagan ang agency, baka raw inaway na ni tita ang nakausap niya sa agency at binantaan na ipapa tulfo daw (naiintindihan ko naman si tita kay usually ganon talaga mga kilala kong boomers) sabi ni ate na pinsan ko. now, super grateful ako kay so na nagagawa niya kong pakalmahin kahit napaka overthinker ko. we will pray for mama's safety there in riyadh. if may mga kakilala kayo sa fra o nasa riyadh (near alyasmi ), please baka matulungan niyo ko sa concern namin. i forgot, nung last vc namin ni mama ay nabanggit niya na minsan nahahampas niya na ang cp niya kasi raw naglalag gawa nang mabagal ang internet. hindi naman nananakit ang amo niya, mabait naman daw pero sinasabi niyang kuripot kay tinitipid daw siya sa food. so, i assumed na nasira ang phone ni mama kaya hindi namin siya ma-contact. i tried locating her phone through google's 'find my device' app, but i can't locate her. di naman nag ooff si mama ng gps niya sa phone kasi chinecheck ko yan siya before sa app na yan. ang concern ko lang ay baka ma-depress si mama ng todo kasi palagi siya nag rarant sa amin everyday sa tuwing tumatawag siya na nababagot na daw siya doon kasi wala siyang makausap. palagi niya kaming tinatawagan para hindi siya ma-bored doon, kahit na choppy siya. i will be celebrating my bday this month and my only wish is for her to be safe palagi sa saudi. debut ko na this yr at gusto ko sana kasama ko buong family ko mag celebrate pero nasa malayo si mama. pero kahit sana maka-vc man lang namin siya. i hope she's okay. i really miss her. take ko na rin tong opportunity to ask if totoo ba na hindi usually nasusunod ang kontrata ng mga ofw (in middle east, particularly, saudi), lalo na sa day off? update: a friend of my cousin's friend contacted my mother's employer and hung up when she uttered my mother's name. update (2): i want to express my heartfelt gratitude po for the overwhelming support and concern many of you shared in response to this post. i'm relieved to update you all na we've heard from my mom na, and she's safe, thank god! it turns out her employer's internet service was temporarily disconnected, and they estimate it could take up to 2 weeks to resolve. ito po yung reason bakit hindi siya nakapag-contact sa amin. wala po siyang sim card ng saudi and she doesn't have mobile data. di rin po siya basta pina-connect ng amo niya sa data nila. luckily, maybe after ma-raise ang concerns sa iba't-ibang agencies particularly sa fra ng mom ko na ilang beses tinawagan yung employer, her employer finally allowed her brief access to their data po, allowing her to contact us and provide reassurance. it was a very tough time for our entire family. i can't imagine if anything bad happens sa mom ko. thank you all for your support and kind words. it means the world to us, and we're now in a much better state knowing my mom is okay. appreciate you all po! lahat ng comments niyo binasa ko at sobrang laking tulong ng mga suggestions ninyo, and most importantly, ng mga prayers ninyong lahat 🙏 lesson learned: ngayon ko na-realize na ibang-iba talaga ang culture sa saudi. reality hits hard. di ko inexpect na pati sa mobile data ay kayang ipagdamot ng employer ng mama ko. tho i still believe na hindi naman lahat ng stereotype patungkol sa mga arabs ay totoo and cultural diversity plays a role in this. despite our struggles, i'm still very much grateful that my mom is safe and sound.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/18cr8a4/we_lost_contact_with_our_mom_who_works_as_an/,7 12 2023
Lady MC Taxi Rider,"disclaimer: this post is not sexist nor discriminatory. this is just based from my observation and experience. i would like to share my experience and observations. ilang beses na ko nagbo-book ng mga mc taxi (angkas at joyride) at first time ko lang maka-book ng move it. to my surprise, babae ang rider ko (surprising kasi first time ko makakuha ng babaeng rider). dumating ang rider then lumarga na. in my observation, mas risky at mas mabilis mag-drive ang mga lalaki. kayang sumingit ng mga lalaking rider sa mga kotse at tight spaces nang walang hesitation. unlike with my female rider, mas mabagal at ilang sumingit pero napakaingat sa pagda-drive. banayad lang ang biyahe lalo kung hindi naman magmamadali. personally, nakakailang para sa akin (m) na babae ang rider. not because may malice ang tingin ko sa kaniya pero i have this tendency to close my legs lalo na kung feeling ko mahuhulog ako. of course, puwedeng iba ang interpretation ng babaeng rider sa ganoong movement ng isang lalaking passenger. pagbaba ko, i returned the helmet with thanks and rated her five stars. just to recognize the safe travels. i know this would not represent the entirety of female mc taxi drivers. kaya if ever na babae ulit, i may write a different review. ps. to the move it management, sana hindi lang ""kuya ng kalsada"" ang tag ninyo. kuya at ate sana hehe.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/16o5dud/lady_mc_taxi_rider/,21 09 2023

AITA for feeling no remorse to fanatic lola?,"my lola was the definition of 'narcissistic'. she gaslights everyone in our family and demanded various things from her children. her kids and grankids (we) hated her so much that we often rejoice if unfortunate things happen to her. mas lumala ang ugali niya noong dumating ang campaign period. i'm talking about that palong-palo sa fake news fanatic ni ""who shall not be named"" at feeling niya she's better than everyone else. she even fought multiple senior citizens who said that martial law was a dark time for them. she said that: ""dapat pinapatay na kayo ni marcos para mabawasan dilawan"" to one of her churchmates which started a fight. she even stated that ""all students who are in favor of leni should be killed or (bitayin) and be denied of all scholarships"". now this old lady was always hateful and bitter to those around her. specially sa amin na grandkids niya. i don't know kung ilang beses niya na ba along tinawag na ""bobo"" at ""r\*t\*rded"" dahil di niya raw ako naririnig mag-english. she even called mom's life ""useless"". currently ay pinagkakalat niya sa mga katulad din niyang panatikong matatanda na npa daw ang angat buhay ngo at dapat daw barilin ng mga sundalo ang mga lalahok dito. lalo na daw ang mga muslims. she would like her dear president to erase muslims here in our country last month she had an asthma attack and i feel so happy. i was smiling to myself thinking na 'finally, nagsisimula na ang karma niya'. her health starts declining from that and i still feel no guilt for her. honestly, she deserves it. tldr: lola is a complete narcissistic asshole that i don't feel any remorse that she's slowly dying. in fact, i am happy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/vvgh0r/aita_for_feeling_no_remorse_to_fanatic_lola/,10 07 2022

"We lost contact with our mom, who works as an overseas Filipino worker in Riyadh","tl;dr: we have not heard anything from our mom for four days and we are worried about her safety. i reached out to her agency but there’s no update yet about her situation there. hello , i am the oldest son and just wanted to get this off my chest. i am currently a 3rd yr student and masyado akong na-busy last week gawa't midterms namin yon. last tuesday, napansin ko na hindi na tumatawag or nagchachat si mama at nakita ko na hindi siya talaga nag o-online. nagtaka na ko at sinubukan kong siyang i-message pero walang reply. ang last convo namin at last activity niya sa fb niya ay nung saturday pa. nag sabi na ko sa so ko at sabi niya we'll call owwa tom if wala pa rin response si mama that day. kinabuksan, tinawagan ko na ang owwa at binigay naman ang cellphone number ng agency ni mama para matawagan at i-raise ang concern. tinawagan ko pero walang sumasagot so nag iwan lang ako ng message. later that night, nag reply naman at sinabing ipapaabot daw nila sa foreign recruitment agency (fra). kinabukasan (today), nag send na ng message ang agency ni mama sa fra this morning at nag reply naman ang fra na they will check with the employer at babalikan daw ang agency kapag may update na. we were all so worried na to the point na si tita, nataranta na at tinawagan ang agency, baka raw inaway na ni tita ang nakausap niya sa agency at binantaan na ipapa tulfo daw (naiintindihan ko naman si tita kay usually ganon talaga mga kilala kong boomers) sabi ni ate na pinsan ko. now, super grateful ako kay so na nagagawa niya kong pakalmahin kahit napaka overthinker ko. we will pray for mama's safety there in riyadh. if may mga kakilala kayo sa fra o nasa riyadh (near alyasmi ), please baka matulungan niyo ko sa concern namin. i forgot, nung last vc namin ni mama ay nabanggit niya na minsan nahahampas niya na ang cp niya kasi raw naglalag gawa nang mabagal ang internet. hindi naman nananakit ang amo niya, mabait naman daw pero sinasabi niyang kuripot kay tinitipid daw siya sa food. so, i assumed na nasira ang phone ni mama kaya hindi namin siya ma-contact. i tried locating her phone through google's 'find my device' app, but i can't locate her. di naman nag ooff si mama ng gps niya sa phone kasi chinecheck ko yan siya before sa app na yan. ang concern ko lang ay baka ma-depress si mama ng todo kasi palagi siya nag rarant sa amin everyday sa tuwing tumatawag siya na nababagot na daw siya doon kasi wala siyang makausap. palagi niya kaming tinatawagan para hindi siya ma-bored doon, kahit na choppy siya. i will be celebrating my bday this month and my only wish is for her to be safe palagi sa saudi. debut ko na this yr at gusto ko sana kasama ko buong family ko mag celebrate pero nasa malayo si mama. pero kahit sana maka-vc man lang namin siya. i hope she's okay. i really miss her. take ko na rin tong opportunity to ask if totoo ba na hindi usually nasusunod ang kontrata ng mga ofw (in middle east, particularly, saudi), lalo na sa day off? update: a friend of my cousin's friend contacted my mother's employer and hung up when she uttered my mother's name. update (2): i want to express my heartfelt gratitude po for the overwhelming support and concern many of you shared in response to this post. i'm relieved to update you all na we've heard from my mom na, and she's safe, thank god! it turns out her employer's internet service was temporarily disconnected, and they estimate it could take up to 2 weeks to resolve. ito po yung reason bakit hindi siya nakapag-contact sa amin. wala po siyang sim card ng saudi and she doesn't have mobile data. di rin po siya basta pina-connect ng amo niya sa data nila. luckily, maybe after ma-raise ang concerns sa iba't-ibang agencies particularly sa fra ng mom ko na ilang beses tinawagan yung employer, her employer finally allowed her brief access to their data po, allowing her to contact us and provide reassurance. it was a very tough time for our entire family. i can't imagine if anything bad happens sa mom ko. thank you all for your support and kind words. it means the world to us, and we're now in a much better state knowing my mom is okay. appreciate you all po! lahat ng comments niyo binasa ko at sobrang laking tulong ng mga suggestions ninyo, and most importantly, ng mga prayers ninyong lahat 🙏 lesson learned: ngayon ko na-realize na ibang-iba talaga ang culture sa saudi. reality hits hard. di ko inexpect na pati sa mobile data ay kayang ipagdamot ng employer ng mama ko. tho i still believe na hindi naman lahat ng stereotype patungkol sa mga arabs ay totoo and cultural diversity plays a role in this. despite our struggles, i'm still very much grateful that my mom is safe and sound.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/18cr8a4/we_lost_contact_with_our_mom_who_works_as_an/,7 12 2023

'ano naman to.' then dm sa akin 'anong pinagsasasabi mo? pinapahiya mo magulang mo. di ka nahihiya?' nagdilim na lang paningin ko. every time na binabara nila ako sa posts ko about bbm or sara, technically, pinapahiya nila ako. di ba sila nahihiya? sobrang daming naunpack after that. sa totoo lang, di naman sila ganyan kadouchebags. naging ganyan lang after the elections. parang every time na kinicriticise mo ang mga marcos, offended na offended sila. wala akong tinatawag na bobo or tanga. i accepted na yun binoto nila. never ko sila ininsulto, pero kinacall out ko ang gobyerno. 'grabe niyo naman ipagtanggol si bbm. anak niyo?' sinagot ako ng 'di kupal si bbm tulad mo.' wow! no words! pakiramdam ko nagpost ako as validation na rin sa konsensya ko kung masama ba akong tao para pabayaan yung sarili kong magulang kung icutoff ko sila. yung huli kong message ay 'ok, kupal pala ako, sarili niyong anak, kumpara kay marcos. sige, sa kanya kayo manghingi ng panggastos niyo ah.' sabay block. di ko gets yung level ng fanaticism. it's not just pride, it's straight up delusion. nakalimutan ko ring banggitin na my dad was named after sr. lmfao. i did not delete the post, btw. kung friend ko kayo sa facebook, feeling ko, maeentertain kayo hahahahaha. silver lining is i reconnected with my cousins na nakakarelate. nagtutulungan na kami paano gagawin sa siblings ko. pagdadasal ko na lang na magising sila sa delusion nila. iniisip ko na lang din buti di ako naimpluwensyahan ng ganoong mentality. edit: nagdm na ang extended family ko sa akin, asking bakit ko raw binabastos ang dad ko. i-'haha' react ko lang lahat kasi i am now choosing pettiness dahil naubos na yung kindness hahahahahaha. edit 2: nagcomment yung isa kong tita: yung bible verse na 'honour thy father and mother'. nag-'haha' react ako tapos sa group chat namin, tinag ako at sabing ginagamit daw ako ng demonyo. haha react lang ulit sagot ko hahahahahahahaha.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/16pzcgg/update_woes_of_a_kakampink_ofw/,23 09 2023
My thanksgiving dinner experience with a BBM family.,"so eto nga guys, nag-punta kami (me (f), my wife (f) my sister and her bf) reluctantly sa invitation ng ilocano-bbm tita na kapit-bahay namin. may pinag-samahan naman yung family kahit papano, before elections super ganda ng communication namin sa kanila kasi kapitbahay namin dito sa canada. saktong usapan lang, nag-dasal kami bago kumain. to be honest, ang ganda nung prayer. as an agnostic, na-appreciate ko naman siya. pero gagi, yung kapatid ko brining-up yung pag-unfriend ko sa tito ko na misogynistic bbm supporter din tapos sabi sakin bigla nung bbm na tita: ""kayo kasi maka-leni kayong lahat diba? dapat di na kayo nagpapa-niwala sa kwento kwento lang. dapat sa totoong news sources lang."" mind you, binigyan ko lang siya nuon ng heads-up na fake yung website source niya (halatang fake kasi no actual sources from credible organizations, news sites, people, also the ones she sent me usually walang https:// (unsecure-doesnt mean all with https:// are legit as well) tapos yung design nung buong site, parang cult na may agila, illuminati sht - web designer and dev ako) tapos kinimkim pala niya yun. di ko nalang tinuloy yung pag-rebut ko kasi yung wife ko natatakot na magalit ako. i was very polite about it kasi mas matanda siya sakin and i was just looking out for her. then na-bring up nanaman ng kapatid ko about yung recently nangyari kay leila de lima. gagi nagulat ako sabi ng panganay niyang babae, ""dapat pinatay na nila yun. tinuluyan na dapat sinaksak."" sabay silang pamilyang tumawa (aside sa bunso na awkward sa situation) i felt chills. paanong nakakapag-dasal ng ganun kaganda tapos without any hesitations, would wish harm on other people just like that. ps. sinabihan din nung bbm tita yung mom ko directly bakit ako nag-cocomment and nag-popost na kumakalaban sa views niya. tas sabi ni bbm tita ""isang post mo nalang eh sasampalin na kita."" sabay tawa. eto din isang kinagalit ko sila yung traditional toxis filipino family. lakas nilang i-body shame yung asawa ko sa harap ko? muntik na talaga nag-liparan ang mga lumpia. anyways, officially cut ties with them na. may bbm supporter akong mga kakilala pero not that extreme (madalas dahil lang kasi ilocano. &nbsp; &nbsp; (edit) just to answer some questions. &nbsp; > quote q1. why was politics bough up nung dinner? i did not want to talk about politics because i knew it was going to be a mess, pero my sister thought our casual arguments sa fb nuon nung tita is civil and casual. she thought wrong. she had no idea the tita was extremely pro-marcos. she tried to change the topic but we decided na umalis bago magka-gulo (because i get really unpleasant pag nasimulan ko nang magalit and isa yun sa puna ng wife ko sakin kaya ayaw ko siya lalo ma-stress) anywho, lesson learned sa kapatid ko lol &nbsp; >quote q2. di bako sumagot or stoop up for what i believe in? i tried. di sa pag-tanggol sa pagkatalo or sa binoto ko, pero sa misinformation na nagbblur sa totoo at hindi. ang sagot sakin ""naniniwala ka kasi sa fake news. dun ka sa totoong balita lang. wag sa kwento kwento sa facebook at tiktok."" can't argue with people who always things they're right. siya nag-banggit na kay leni kami nag-vote last election and my side of the family all nodded (said ""yes. syempre tita."") then she proceeded to complain about the philippines being poor right now and then overcompensating sa pag-puri kay bbm after niya magreklamo. lol also i don't ever want to stoop low para makipag-sampalan at murahan sa harap nung bunso nila (na awkwardly listening to her mom talk about marcos. i guess she's the ""odd"" one in the family.) &nbsp; >quote q3. but they body-shamed your wife? di ka pumatol? as mentioned i can become harsh pag galit ako. my wife doesn't like me when i'm at that point of anger kaya we just looked at each other and signaled na umalis na. although i told them my wife is building strength kasi nag-ddeadlift siya. di nila alam ata kung ano yun. tbh nung tumahimik ako, napansin nung bf ng sister ko and akala daw nila may gagawin ako. i'm honestly surprised i held it in like that. i'm quite proud of myself. charot &nbsp; >quote q4. important ba sila sa inyo? nung bago-bago palang kami sa canada isa yung tita na nagshashare ng food niya samin sa work, nag-lolook out for us and genuinely concerned if we were okay. kaya masakit din na this happened. &nbsp; >quote q5. anong nangyari sa fresh lumpia? binigyan kami ng pa-take home pero wala na gusto kumain. binalik ko yung plate nila kahapon pero di ko na kinausap. iniwan ko nalang sa pinto nila. &nbsp; &nbsp; >quote edit: clarified that not all websites with ""https://"" are legit din.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/y1fwdi/my_thanksgiving_dinner_experience_with_a_bbm/,11 10 2022

Creatures of Philippine Lower Mythology,"reading this book it details the physical attributes, magic and power, capabilities and domiciles of philippine lower mythological beings like demons (kapre, tikbalang) aswangs, witches, mermaids and engkantos. the book taps the history of pre-colonial philippines. the book also explore the comprehensive effects of these creatures in the daily life of filipinos. positive man or negative. while some filipinos believe in the existence of these creatures, some may not. i personally believe that science should triumph over superstitious or primitive beliefs. that everything has a logical explanations be it sa pagkalampag ng bubong (dahil dinapuan ng aswang ang bubong) or itim na aso na umaaligid sa bahay ng may sakit. however, nakakaaliw din magbasa or makinig ng mga stories tungkol sa aswang, mangkukulam, engkanto, tikbalang and etc. so bilang malapit na ang halloween at bilang batang pinanganak ng early 90s na part ng school life yung pinagkwekwentuhan ang mga kwentong kakatakutan kapag ganitong buwan…drop your stories here (narinig man or naexperience) about these creatures of the night.",https://i.redd.it/15237my7qysb1.jpg,8 10 2023

Guarantee letter from OVP para sa immunotherapy meds?,may nakapagtry na po ba dito na humingi ng tulong sa ovp para macover yung gamot nila para sa immunotherapy? pumunta kasi mama ko sa ovp tapos ang sabi nya sakin 5k guarantee letter lang daw makukuha namin pero pinakuha daw sya ng quotation ng gamot at worth 140k++ yung gamot. sinubukan namin humingi ng medical assistance sa kanila kasi nung pumunta kami sa dswd kinover naman nila lahat ng cost ng gamot. yung binyaran nalang namin ay yung pagbigay sakin ng gamot sa iv sa ospital. itry naman daw namin sa ovp kasi makakarequest ulit kami ng gamot sa dswd pagkatapos pa ng 3 months. nakakapanlumo lang na nagleave mama ko ng halos dalawang araw tapos yun lang mapapala. mas mahal pa magagastos namin kung kunin ang guarantee letter sa kanila kumpara sa kung magbabayad kami diretso sa ospital. kung may pambayad lang kami edi sana ganon nalang ginawa namin diba hindi na kami humingi sa kanila ng financial assistance. sa mga tulad ko na may cancer o ibang malubhang sakit nakasubok na ba kayo humingi ng guarantee letter sa ovp para sa mahal na gamot o treatment (more than 100k) tapos sinabihan kayo na hanggang 5k lang ang guarantee letter? nakakalungkot 1 month na delay ang pagpapagamot ko.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/16gr6n2/guarantee_letter_from_ovp_para_sa_immunotherapy/,12 09 2023
Konsensiya at Awa ang pumipigil,"kapag nakakakita ako ng ages 35+ na babae at lalaki na di stable ang income tapos naganak, nanlulumo ako. sa situation kasi namin late 30s na nagasawa mga magulang namin at di rin nakareceive ng proper education. so they aren't just incapable financially, they too cannot set a good example to us lalo na nung formative years. my father brag about the anti-social behavior he committed in the past. he is ill-tempered, tamad, at irresponsible. you can really tell that the proper ways of doing things. like pag nagsuklay sa jeep meaning nun malandi ka na. imbis na turuan kami magmahalan, madalas sasabihan niya na gantihan kapatid ko pagnagaaway ganun. our mama naman, she did everything for us to the point na nalosyang siya, as in maaga kumulubot ang skin. medyo timid at consintidor type siya kaya hinayaan niya maging batugan tatay namin. hanggang hindi na kinaya ng health niya. so ayun na nga, ang ending mukha kami laging mga basang sisiw nuon. lagi kami nabubully kasi poor and also most of our clothes were hand-me-downs. we were all thriving in school and gave extra effort nung students pa kami to the point na sinampal kami lahat ng kahirapan kasi nakita naman how wide the gap is, how insufficient we are financially. thankfully, we were able to graduate in one of the well-known public uni in the country. we are all working now but we are all still stucked. ganito pala pag mahirap ka, ang hirap din umangat. lalo na pag ang dkait ng parent mo umaabot ng more than 35k a month. ang dami pang extra gastos. hospitalization, check-ups, at iba pang needs. ang tagal mo na tumutulong but nothing seems to change. minsan gusto ko na mabuhay sa paraan na gusto ko. pero kasi wala talagang kayang makasuport kundi ako lang. may sakit din kasi mga kapatid ko. nakakalungkot lang. tapos minsan ang hirap pa kasama mga kawork lalo na manager, lahat issue. ang difficult na mga tao. hayss. still, i'm still fighting my battles fairly. magdusumikap pa rin ako hanggang sa makahanap ng pagkakataong mabuhay para sa sarili ko. yun lang sorry haba.. wala mapagkwentuhan e.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/16u61sb/konsensiya_at_awa_ang_pumipigil/,28 09 2023
Ang hirap maging mahirap,"hi everyone! ito yung pinaka unang beses ko mag post sa reddit and unfortunately dahil pa sa sakit. (please bear with me). during college around 2014-2018 may nararamdaman na ako na pananakit sa sikmura pero sobrang hina or hindi ganon ka grabe then last week kumirot sya ng sobra so nag decide ako magpa er sa private hospital (since may hmo naman ako) pero hindi nila ako tinaggap dahil nung pagpunta ko ay nawala naman yung sakit so tolerable naman daw so nirefer nila ako sa outpatient then after ng mga procedures (labs), so ayun nga may gallstones ako. then na er ulit ako this week dahil hindi ko na kinaya yung aakit and need ko daw ng surgery tumanggi ako dahil baka hindi covered ng hmo ko (maxicare, 150k). bumalik ako sa unang hospital na pinuntahan ko so doon sa akin na explain yung surgery na gagawin which is yung ""open"" or ""laparoscopic"" at ang quotation is around 250k-350k depende pa kung walang ibang findings na makita understandable kasi private yung hospital. nag try ako pumunta sa mercado general hospital inc. sa compound ng pgh for second opinion then sabi sa akin ay aabutin ng around 75k-85k minus yung sa philhealth na around 15k daw so malaki pa din. working naman ako pero wala akong ipon dahil mahirap yung kalagayan namin at nag sisimula pa lang kami. ako lang din mag isa nag aasikaso ng lahat. kumakapit na lang ako sa kahit anong maliit na pag asa na nakikita ko, ayoko mapagod, ayaw ko mawalan ng pag asa pero bakit naman ganito. ang lala na ng anxiety ko na hindi ako makapag isip ng matino, ang daming tumatakbo sa isip ko gusto ko i rant isa isa pero baka ma bored lang kayo. so need ko po ng help/advise: 1. saang hospital may ganoon na procedure yung free or kung hindi man is yung covered ng hmo na hindi lalagpas sa 100k? 2. if ever saan po pwede manghingi ng cash assistance? at ano need na paper since ultrasound and medical certificate lang po ang meron ako. 3. or if may mga alam po kayo na pwede gawin para makapag undergo ng surgery na hindi need mag labas ng sobrang laking pera or mas better kung wala po thank you in advance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/13kauvf/ang_hirap_maging_mahirap/,17 05 2023
Short Tagalog Story (I hope you like it),"i'm in a creative mood so i thought of writing a short story. mga anito ng maynila **sa may simbahan ng binondo** nakatingin ang babae sa kalesa at sa kabayo na nakapwesto sa harap ng simbahan ng binondo. may maliit na ngiti sa gilid ng kanyang labi. “sakay kayo?” tanong ng kutsero sa babae. “di ko akalaing makakita ako ng ganito dito.” sabi ng babae. “konti na nga lang mga kalesa dito sa maynila. kung gusto nyo ng ikot lang pwede na ang tatlong daan, pa gabi na din kasi.” “salamat, pero di ko po sila kayang sakyan.” “dalawang daan?” “salamat pa rin po.” tumango ang kutsero at bumalik sa panonood sa kanyang cellphone. “hanapin mo ako.” bulong ng babae sa kabayo bago maglakad pa alis. **sa isang murang hotel sa soler st.** nag ring ang telepono sa room 314. “mam, may lalaki po dito hinahanap kayo.” “paki patuluyin mo sa kwarto ko.” “bukas yan” ang sagot ng babae pagka katok sa kanyang pinto. “nakita mo ang ilaw ng kandila?” tumango ang mama. “pwede ba?” tanong ng lalaki nung binunot nya ang pakete ng fortune. humindi ang babae at tinuro ang “no-smoking” sign sa kwarto. “nagulat ako nung nakita kita kanina, di ko inakalang may… kagaya mo dito sa siyudad.” “at di ko din inakalang may manananggal na bibisita sa siyudad at tumabi pa sa simbahan.” “walang epekto ang simbahan sa akin, taga panga-alaga pa nga ako ng mga santo sa amin. kung alam lang ng mga tao dun.” tumingin tingin ang lalaki sa kwarto. may kandilang itim na naka sindi sa maliit na lamesa at may maleta na may sticker ng cebu pacific na galing tagbilaran sa sahig. “galing ka ng bohol?” “sa loon. nakita ko ang pangalan mo sa kalesa. richard nga ba ang pangalan mo?” tumango ang lalaki. “ako si avelina pero lina na lang itawag mo sa akin” “ano ang pakay mo dito?” “hinahanap ko si bathala.” “di na sya ang bathalang tulad ng dati.” “nandito nga sya? kaya mo ba akong samahan papunta sa kanya?” nagisip isip si richard at walang maisagot sa babae. “may sakit ako at konti na lang ang oras ko dito, sya na lang ang pag asa ko.” “sasamahan kita sa kanya, pero wag ka magugulat sa makikita mo.” bumaba papuntang lobby ang dalawa at lumabas ng hotel. kahit lagpas alas-onse ng gabi ay madami pa din mga kotse sa kalsada. “malayo ba sya?” “walang deretsong jeep papunta sa pwesto nya, lakarin na lang natin.” sarado na ang mga tindahan bukod sa mga 7-11 na nadaraanan ng dalawa. nakapag sindi na din ng sigarilyo si richard habang nag lalakad. “matagal ka na dito sa maynila?” “mga tatlumpung taon na.” “alam ng kutsero kung ano ka?” “oo, mabait ang pamilyang yun sa akin. yung kutsero kanina, anak na yun ng may ari ng kalesa.” “meron din kagaya mo sa bohol, pero sa ibang lugar sila nakatira. may kilala akong apat na kagaya mo doon.” “ikaw pa lang ang manananggal na nakita ko dito sa loob ng apat na taon. may nakilala ako dati na nagging flight stewardess. mahilig yata kayo talagang lumipad.” “di ko yata kaya ang mawalay sa mga tanim at alaga ko. parang ikaw, mukha naman kuntento ka na sa pamilyang kumupkop sayo.” “araguy!” napatigil ang matandang babae dahil sa sakit sa tagiliran. inalalayan naman sya ni richard. “mabilis sana kung lumipad tayo, pero di ko alam saan ang pupuntahan natin.” “di mo ako kayang bitbitin, manang” “akala mo lang, tikbalang” “malapit na din tayo, ulitin ko lang, wag ka magulat sa makikita mo.” tumango si avelina sa sinabi ni richard. nakarating sila sa quiapo church at naglakad patungo sa mga eskinita sa tabi nito. may tindahan ng mga halamang gamot at iba rito ay nasa botelya. “pampa-regla” “gamot sa eksema” mga nakadikit sa bote. may matandang lalaking panot at mabahong natutulog sa tabi ng tindahan na ito. “sya ang hinahanap mo” sabi ni richard kay manang. lumuhod si manang kay bathala at binaba ang ulo. umubo si richard para magising si bathala. walang nangyari at patuloy lang sa pag hilik ang matandang lalaki. tinapik na ni richard ang upuan ng lalaki kaya ito nagising. nagulat si bathala ng makitang si manang avelina na nakaluhod sa harapan nya sabay tingin kay richard. “hoy kamusta, richard? buhat na dyan, di mo kailangan gawin yan, basta may pambayad ka may gamot ako dito. hula ko hindi pampa regla ang kailangan mo.” “bumyahe pa yan mula bohol para makita ka.” sabi ni richard. “meron po akong sakit at kailangan ko ang tulong nyo.” “ano ang sakit mo?” at kinuwento nga ni manang avelina ang kanyang mga sintomas at nakinig naman si bathala. “pasensya ka na, pero wala akong maitutulong sa sakit mo. mga gamot na mabibigay ko ay pantulong lang sa kirot pero di ito mapapahaba ang buhay mo.” “naniniwala pa po ako sa inyong kapangyarihan. baka pwede nyo pong gamitin ang kapangyarihan nyo sa akin.” natawa si bathala. “nakikita mo ba ako? tatlong araw na akong di nakakaligo at nagbabantay na lang ako ng tindahan na ito. dito ako natutulog dahil wala akong bahay. alam mo kung bakit ko piniling pumwesto dito sa simbahan ng quiapo? para maramdaman ko man lang na ako ang sinasamba ng mga tao pero hindi ako ang sinasamba nila kaya’t wala na akong kapangyarihan. ang mangilan-ngilan na kapangyarihan ko sa mga mangigilan na bumubulong ng pangalan ko sa kanilang dasal ay binubuhos ko sa mga gamot na to.” “alam mo sinasamba ng mga tao ngayon? pera. wala din ako nyan. mukha bang malakas ang bentahan ng pwesto ko? pero bebentahan kita ng gamot dahil di pa din ako kumakain ng pang gabi. itong isang bote na to, 350 na lang. inumin mo to isang kutsara sa umaga at isa sa gabi para sa sakit. pero ulitin ko, di ka nito mapapagaling.” kumuha ng pera si manang avelina sa kanyang pitaka at ibinayad kay bathala. “salamat! bumalik ka, hija! at kung maari, babalik na ako sa tulog ko. richard, daan ka ulit dito minsan. kwentuhan tayo.” “salamat pa rin po, dakilang bathala.” at naglakad na pabalik patungo sa hotel ang dalawa. “ayoko man isipin at ayokong maniwala, pero pera na nga yata ang kapangyarihan ngayon. yun na din yata ang sagot sa sakit ko.” sabi ni lina habang naglalakad pabalik. “at least kung may pera ako may pang ospital ako.” “kung di ka din matutulungan ni bathala at pera din lang pala sagot sa problema mo baka hindi si bathala ang pinuntahan natin.” “sino?” “si pilandok” hope to be continued",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/vy5jhx/short_tagalog_story_i_hope_you_like_it/,13 07 2022

Permanent WFH Setup: Filipinos Should Look Into Virtual Assistant (VA) Industry,"i want to share this here hoping that it could help some people who are tired from the daily commute that they have to endure just to get to work. marami pa ibang dahilan bakit gusto mag wfh ng isang tao katulad ng: * kailangan mag alaga ng anak o kapamilya na may sakit o matanda na, * malayo ang bahay sa trabaho kaya gusto makatipid sa pamasahe/gas, * estudyante na gusto ng pang allowance/tuition, * may sakit pero kailangan pa rin magtrabaho para may kita, * etc. virtual assistant (va) is a general term that refers to freelancers working **remotely** for **foreign clients**. merong mga freelancers na hindi remote workers (e.g. photographer, model, insurance agent, etc.) kaya wag ka malilito sa term na ""freelancer"" at ""va"". vas yung mga nagtatrabaho sa bahay, sa coffee shop, sa beach, kahit saan kase ""remote worker"" sila. never nila poproblemahin ang return-to-office (rto) order kase nasa ibang bansa yung client nila. anong pwede maging trabaho ng va? depende sa designation. a va can be a/an: * administrative assistant, * architect, * auditor, * bookkeeper, * content creator, * customer service representative, * graphic designer, * human resource, * it personnel * paralegal, * seo specialist, * social media manager, * web developer, * writer, * etc. halos lahat ng designation pwede ma-categorize as va basta permanent wfh + foreign client. just like traditional jobs, you need to apply for the position, undergo interview, training and you can be laid off too due to poor performance, bankruptcy, world crisis, etc. > pros ng pagiging va 1. permanent wfh setup 2. flexible hours (depending on the contract) 3. salary in foreign currency 4. lower tax rate 5. work-life balance > cons ng pagiging va 1. you need to be tech savvy to start in this field, 2. saturated market. madami gusto mag wfh ever since nag pandemic, 3. no ph government benefits, ikaw magfa-file ng taxes mo at magbabayad ng contributions mo as self-employed, 4. no hmo, 13th month pay and bonus **unless** mag agree kayo ng client na meron 5. you need to be independent and resourceful kase kung gusto mo tinuturo lahat sayo at wala ka initiative matuto mag isa, mahirap. short story: i became a part-time va (social media manager) in 2016. i worked with an australian client but i left after 6 months kase mababa ang sahod tapos lakas mag micro-manage and nag focus na lang ako sa pag aaral. tumigil ako ng ilang taon, kinalimutan ko na, maliit naman sahod. in 2019, few months before covid lockdown, i tried again because school expenses are hurting my pocket. this time, i am a full-time va (administrative assistant) for a us client. my starting salary was php22,500 and then it went up to 25k to 27k to 50k. i was promoted to operations manager and started earning php100k a month. after graduation and during bar review, i continued working. when i passed the bar exam in 2022, i told my client that i will leave the job so i can focus on my legal career. he does not want me to leave so he doubled my salary from 2k usd to 4k usd (php200k a month). he also pays for our medical insurance, 13th and 14th month pay, monthly bonus and gadget upgrade. currently, i have 2 jobs: va and my traditional job. mahirap ang buhay. kung kaya mag double job, grab it. you can learn to be a va through: 1. reddit (r/buhaydigital) 2. facebook (online filipino freelancers page) 3. youtube 4. other vas 5. google hindi kami hiring ngayon, wag nyo i-send saken resume nyo. protect your identity, this is reddit. i am just hoping that this could help someone who wants a permanent wfh setup. sobrang pahirap yung public transportation system sa pilipinas, and it will take years and good leaders before we see improvements. that's it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/w8j318/permanent_wfh_setup_filipinos_should_look_into/,26 07 2022

Open your eyes,"i will begin by prefacing that i am nobody special, i do not have any redeeming qualities or anything that set me apart from the mass. my only service to the country is the money that i pay in the form of taxes, as well as my desire for it to improve. i will not hide behind a falsified pretense, and i will be upfront and direct. all throughout my life, i've always harbored distaste towards philippines. to me, it was largely unruly and hypocritical; i was forced to suffer through a life so intricately tied to politics. a large number of my family members are connected to politics, i grew up hearing and seeing about politics. my aunts and uncles? politicians. that isn't to say that i have a keen understanding and comprehension of it, no. i am not an analyst, nor am i sagacious enough to pinpoint the finer details of such things. at first, i wanted to become a great person. a lawyer to uphold the law. or perhaps a soldier to fight in the frontlines to protect it. but that steadily deteriorated until money became what i desired, i wanted to become a teacher so that i may teach and at the same time earn money. then even that shattered under the weight of this society. perhaps this is what many would construe as an existential dread; i knew not what i wished to do. in time, i began to grow jaded and exhausted of it all, eventually ceasing to think about my motherland anymore. i considered it to be too congealed in corruption for it to ever be cleansed of it. but now, it's gotten to the point that i can no longer stop caring or averting my eyes. however, **i am powerless.** all i have to offer now are the experiences that i've gone through, the wisdom i picked up throughout my life, my knowledge and my very creed. my voice may go unheard, my ripple may end up small and my wisdom? obsolete. but that matters not. my fellow filipinos, i implore you, i beseech you, to never stop thinking and to never surrender your self. your ethos and your ego. do not simply conform and follow the tide, do not simply melt into the masses like i have in the past. i have staggered because of it, sacrificing my individuality to fit in. do not make that same mistake. ""i think, therefore i am."" is one of my lifelines, but perhaps it truly is harder to see what is right underneath you as i have failed to employ this line until recently. **i am reaching out not to those who are already awake and can see this injustice, i am calling out to the slumbering hearts of those who support president rodrigo roa duterte, better known as the dds.** i am begging you, my kinsmen. open your eyes. do not surrender your very identity for the sake of money, do not surrender your very ego and allow the society to congeal into yourself, turning you into yet another faceless flock. i know that you are not stupid, i know that you are not foolish. look around you, and think for yourself. listen to the voices around you, the loud cries and the hushed whispers then think for yourself. think, so that you will remain yourself. think, so that you may retain all the years you've spent living your life. you are you, no one else may ever become you. you are a unique existence that can only be a singular person in this entire fabric of reality. do not surrender the treasure that is your ego solely for money, or worse for empty platitudes. think, what has he done for us during this time of crisis? enumerate every single one of them in your mind. list them out, so that you may better quantify the help that you believe he has given us. comprehend and think of every single benefit he may have given us. then think, what has he done against us during this time of crisis? what has he done to oppress us? list them out, seek them out, discern every deed that he may have done that harmed us directly, or indirectly. identify things that he may have **not** done to help us, for there is nothing worse than inaction in a time of need. please, if you would only do this not for me, but for yourself who has lived many years of your life remaining who you are. i am begging you. and to the rest of us, who are wide awake after this harsh jolt from reality. may you accept this heartfelt present if you can read this. accept the lessons i have learned from my life, accept the experiences that i have gone through and catalyzed for those of us in dire straits. even if it hurts, even if it's tiring, even if it doesn't seem to make sense. never stop thinking, never stop trying to understand what is happening. for to think is to be yourself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ftzfc7/open_your_eyes/,3 04 2020

""a brilliant individual"" is how people around me often describe me. but somehow that changed after that one decision that i made in 2018. my family started to treat me like someone who couldn't make any rational decisions. but what i really can't forget is what my professor in college told me the last time we met, about 6 months after the october exams. he said: ""alam mo sayang, ka magaling ka pa naman top ka sa klase ko."" at that moment everything sinked in na realize ko lahat lalo na yung mga opportunities na sinayang ko. simula noon pakiramdam ko di nako nakarecover yung motivation ko at unti unti ring nawala yung mga reasons ko na magtake ng cpale. the following year, i tried to do a self-review for the board exam in may but ended up bailing again. my reason at that time was that i needed to review pa kasi gusto ko sa top 10 ako, which is the same reason why i didn't take the exam in october of the previous year, as noong nag preboard ako, that in october of 2018, i was only on top 19. my thinking at that time was that if i gave it some effort, maybe i could enter the top 10. kaya from october 2018 to may 2019, naging october 2019 ng finally nagtake nako ng exam and failed, puro reasons ginawa ko at lagi kong reason di pako nakakareview di ako prepared kaya di ako magtatake, but the more na dinelay ko for more time to review, eh wala namang pagrereview na nangyari, ni hindi ko nabuksan yung libro kahit isang pahina. the truth is ang hirap mag aral magisa lalo na kung yung naging motivation mo lang to finish the course is your friends. so that october, after not reading or solving any accounting-related materials, i took the boards. at that time, bago mag-exam ang yabang ko, pa sabi ko sa sarili ko, what if pumasa ko, how cool will that be after more than a year of not studying? not surprisingly, i failed that october 2019 cpale. i ended up not having a job for 2 years because of my stupid decisions, and after i failed the boards, i was really devastated. mostly because i failed, and that failure was a result of me not giving my best. yung kaya ko naman kaso di ko pinahalagahan yung mga privilege nabinigay sakin, 3 consecutive review centers na fully paid ng parents ko na bihira lang ako pumasok at may allowance and condo pa. ang dami kong sinayang na habang tumatagal na rerealize ko na tama yung prof ko baka nga sayang ako. after 2 years of being depressed, i finally had the courage to go out again and find a job. but at that time, my confidence level was so low that i didn't have the guts to apply for an accounting-related job. i felt at the time that i didn't deserve it, so i applied to a bpo company instead. i did a great job there and was awarded as one of the top employees in my first year. pero di ako masaya pakiramdam ko, i don't belong there, na hindi yun yung para sakin araw araw, i'm questioning myself: ""anong ginagawa mo dito"". the following year, i received the devastating news that my friend had died. my friend's father told me that she died because of an illness that was misdiagnosed, and because covid cases were high during that time, she wasn't able to go to the hospital regularly to be checked. this was hard on me because she's the one i looked up to when i was in college; she's the one who got herself all figured out, the complete opposite of me. she was like my anchor when i was at university. you see, she's very smart, hardworking, and even finished college with a full scholarship. she's also the ""panganay,"" so she has all these hopes that someday she'll be successful and be able to help her family. so being with her somewhat motivated me to study. i'm a very laid-back person, and she always kept me in line, reminding me that i can't get everything in life so easily and that i should work hard to get what i want. so when she died, that brought me to the worst point of my life. it's just so hard to think about all the things she will never be able to do or be. i was thinking up until now that maybe if i found out sooner that she was having medical problems. i could have referred her to my uncle. i have all the resources to help her, but i didn't because i thought she was alright. i could have helped her with the medical bills so that her family wouldn't have to struggle so much. i just can't accept the fact that she died because no hospital will accept her because they thought it was covid. it was a very curable illness; it's just that it happened at the worst time. right after her funeral, i decided that i would do everything she told me that she wanted to do. so i quit my job, booked a plane ticket, and traveled to thailand. that country na gustong gusto nya puntahan ever since, but di nya napuntahan. pero habang nasa thailand ako, i felt really sad; narealize ko na she's the most precious person in my life, and that i do love her. i had all these regrets bugging my mind all throughout my stay there. nasana kung di ko sinayang 4 years ng buhay ko magkasama sana kami now. or at least, man lang, i made the effort to spend more time with her before she died. ang daming what ifs, and that happened because i was so engulfed in my own sorrows that i didn't even bother to check on her; in fact, she was the one always reaching out to me. but everything is too late now. kaya ngayon nagdecide ako na hindi lang yung dream destination niya yung puntahan ko kundi pati narin yung mga bagay na di nya natupad ay tuparin ko para sa kanya especially her dream of us becoming a lawyer. i'm currently traveling and wandering around asia right now as a backpacker and working as an esl instructor for a couple of months in different countries. right now i've decided to finally quit my job and go home and try to fix my life. gusto ko tuparin yung lagi nyang sinasabi na magtake ako ulit ng cpale at this time; gawin ko na yung best ko. and when i pass, i'm planning to go to law school for her to fulfill one of her dreams. i hope this is the right decision now. and maybe someday i can be the person that she has always wanted me to be.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/128v23u/should_i_go_back_to_the_philippines/,1 04 2023

'ano naman to.' then dm sa akin 'anong pinagsasasabi mo? pinapahiya mo magulang mo. di ka nahihiya?' nagdilim na lang paningin ko. every time na binabara nila ako sa posts ko about bbm or sara, technically, pinapahiya nila ako. di ba sila nahihiya? sobrang daming naunpack after that. sa totoo lang, di naman sila ganyan kadouchebags. naging ganyan lang after the elections. parang every time na kinicriticise mo ang mga marcos, offended na offended sila. wala akong tinatawag na bobo or tanga. i accepted na yun binoto nila. never ko sila ininsulto, pero kinacall out ko ang gobyerno. 'grabe niyo naman ipagtanggol si bbm. anak niyo?' sinagot ako ng 'di kupal si bbm tulad mo.' wow! no words! pakiramdam ko nagpost ako as validation na rin sa konsensya ko kung masama ba akong tao para pabayaan yung sarili kong magulang kung icutoff ko sila. yung huli kong message ay 'ok, kupal pala ako, sarili niyong anak, kumpara kay marcos. sige, sa kanya kayo manghingi ng panggastos niyo ah.' sabay block. di ko gets yung level ng fanaticism. it's not just pride, it's straight up delusion. nakalimutan ko ring banggitin na my dad was named after sr. lmfao. i did not delete the post, btw. kung friend ko kayo sa facebook, feeling ko, maeentertain kayo hahahahaha. silver lining is i reconnected with my cousins na nakakarelate. nagtutulungan na kami paano gagawin sa siblings ko. pagdadasal ko na lang na magising sila sa delusion nila. iniisip ko na lang din buti di ako naimpluwensyahan ng ganoong mentality. edit: nagdm na ang extended family ko sa akin, asking bakit ko raw binabastos ang dad ko. i-'haha' react ko lang lahat kasi i am now choosing pettiness dahil naubos na yung kindness hahahahahaha. edit 2: nagcomment yung isa kong tita: yung bible verse na 'honour thy father and mother'. nag-'haha' react ako tapos sa group chat namin, tinag ako at sabing ginagamit daw ako ng demonyo. haha react lang ulit sagot ko hahahahahahahaha.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/16pzcgg/update_woes_of_a_kakampink_ofw/,23 09 2023

SOGIE Time (English Terms),"hi po! random post po! i just want to share my knowledge about sogie dahil pride month po ngayon. sexual orientation, gender identity, and expression ito po ang laging napaghahalo ng mga tao = sex, gender, at sexual orientation assigned sex = ito po ang sex natin sa birth certificate na siyang kinumpirma ng mga duktor noong tayo'y nailuwal. afab (assigned female at birth) at amab (assigned male at birth) po ang dalawang nabibilang sa assigned sex. male at female po sa madaling salita intersex = pambihirang pangyayari kung saan hindi maiuri ang isang tao sa gender binary (lalaki ba o babae?) dahil ang pangangatawan and/or ang sex chromosomes ng naturang tao ay alanganin at maselan. (underdeveloped genitalia, coexistence of male and female sex organs in a human body, abnormal sex chromomes) bakit wala po sa mga birth certificate/legal and medical documents ang intersex na category??? dahil hindi ito gaanong documented at hindi nare-recognize ng maraming tao due to its rarity. it is so rare that not everyone knows about them because intersex people choose to conform to the gender binary to avoid attracting negative attention. please watch that one video in jessica soho about a man that menstruates. he is practically an intersex, but he identifies and was identified as a man because his phenotype (outward appearance) presents as that of a typical biological male. gender = a social construct that simplifies and categorizes the norms that people should follow or conform onto according to their assigned sex. dahil po rito, nakikilala po natin kung ang isang tao ba ay lalaki o babae sa unang sulyap natin sa kanilang bihis, kilos, at panlabas na anyo. gender binary = male/female identity = cisgender,/cissexual, transgender/transsexual, or non-binary cisgender = people that are afab or amab that matches with their gender identity. (afab na nag-a-identify as female at amab na nag-a-identify as male). another term for this is cissexual (focusing on the biological aspect of the person rather than their gender identity) transgender = people who identify on a gender that does not match their assigned sex. maaaring sila ay operado (sex reassignment surgery) o hindi operado (without surgery). maaaring sila ay umiinom ng hrt (hormone replacement therapy) pills o hindi. kapag ang isang tao ay nagpabago na ng kaniyang anatomy and physiology, transsexuals na sila... though transgender is still the umbrella term. what about legal documents? sa pilipinas, ipinagbabawal po ang pagpapalit ng pangkapanganakang kasarian natin (sad news for trans people) kahit na ikaw ay nagpa-sex change na. bagkus, pinapayagan ito under medical conditions (nagkamali ang doctor ng assignment sa sex mo, nagkaroon ka ng issues sa pagbibinata/pagdadalaga mo due to possession of intersexual traits.). and this is also debatable on court. non-binary = spectrum ng mga taong ayaw magpatawag na fully lalaki o babae. maaaring nag-aalangan sila sa kanilang identity o dili kaya ay mga intersex individuals who live up to their intersexuality. maaari ring nagrerefer ito sa mga taong nasa spectrum ng pagiging cisgender-transgender (kinikilala ba nila ang pagiging _________ nila from birth as their gender or gusto nilang sumakabilang kasarian? enby people belong between these two ends of the spectrum) sexual orientation: 2 types. sexual or asexual? kapag asexual ka, wala kang gusto. kapag sexual ka naman, nagkakagusto ka. sexual subtypes: heterosexual (straight), homosexual (same-gender-attraction) , bisexual (same-gender at different gender/s from yours ay attracted ka), at marami pa pong iba. transexuality is not a sexual orientation, sexual identity po siya. summary: sex: male (or amab), female (or afab), intersex (it varies from case to case) identities: cis, trans, nb gender: man/boy/lad/lalaki, woman/girl/lady/babae, nb sexual orientation: asexual, sexual (straight and the non-straight categories). at the end of this long post, i just want to say na matuto tayong gumalang sa pagkakakilanlan at pag-ibig ng ating kapuwa dahil may mga kaniya-kaniya tayong mga pinagdaanan sa buhay na siyang humubog sa pagkatao natin ngayon. ilayo natin ang usapang panrelihiyon dahil walang nakaaalam kung ano ba ang tunay na pananampalataya o hindi. subali't, ang taong iyong nakahahalubilo ay totoong-totoo, at bilang isang tao, ayon sa konstitusyon, likas sa atin ang karapatang igalang ng ating kapuwa sa kung sinuman tayo. ultimo ang kriminal nga ay iginagalang eh. ano pa kaya ang inosenteng lgbtq+ na kapuwa nating ipinagsasakdal sa kaniyang pag-ibig? nakasakit ba siya ng kapuwa sa pagiging totoo niya sa kaniyang sarili? nakapapatay ba ng tao ang pagiging bakla? mapanira ba ito sa kalikasan, kabuhayan, at kalusugan ng ibang tao? hindi!!! kasalanan ba ang pagiging bakla? aywan ko sa inyo. pinalaki akong atheist eh hahahahaha ano ba ang sabi ng diyos ninyo? anyways, respeto na lang sa paniniwala ninyo i guess. but what is not respectable is the violence towards the lgbtq+ community. if you participate, promulgate, and/or enable this, you are not worthy of my attention. i may respect you but i cannot tolerate you. unless you choose to change for the better, you deserve whatever criticism you will consequently receive for your close-mindedness. we have to remember na huwag tayong pa-special sa mundong ito. 8 billion ang mga tao, at iisa ka lang. the only constant moral standard in this world is to be makatao. put yourselves in the shoes of others you are trying to judge. do they deserve it? if it were you, do you deserve it? alang sa lahat ng mga baklang (bakla = lgbtq+ community) nagmahal, nakibaka, nabigo, napatay, napatahimik, at napagkaitan ng kanilang kaligayahan at kalayaang maging sila, ipinagbubunyi ko kayo sa pamamagitan ng pagdiriwang ng pride month na ito. bilang kabahagi ng mga lgbtq+, patuloy kong ipaglalaban ang karapatan ng bawat tao (opo, pati ang mga straight.) sa kanilang sogie hanggang makamtan natin ang mga karapatang magpoprotekta at kikilala sa atin bilang mga pilipinong nagmamahal at may karapatang magmahal sa sinumang nais nilang sintahin. simulan po natin sa pagpuna sa mga taong mapanakit sa mga lgbtq+ sa kanilang kilos at pananalita hanggang sa pagboto sa mga pulitikong magsusulong ng mga karapatang pantao ng mga pilipino. sa mga makababasa po nito. maraming salamat po sa inyong pagtitiyaga at malawakang pag-unawa! 🌈happy pride month po sa ating lahat🌈",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/v8njcj/sogie_time_english_terms/,9 06 2022

Traffic is being normalized in the Philippines,"while on my way to work this morning, i just realized how covid-19 affected us in a good way. of course, i'm not talking about those people who got sick and died but about the fact that somehow it made our commutes/rides easier. now na marami ng nag-return to office and sooner ay start na rin ng face to face classes sa public schools, unti-unti ng bumabalik yung usual traffic na nararanasan natin everyday before. nakakawalang gana lang. i miss those times na konti lang yung taong nakakalabas. ang sakit lang isipin na normal na lang to sa atin. yung ang aga-aga mo na ngang gumigising sa umaga para makipagsapalaran sa pag-cocommute tapos malelate ka pa. yung ang mahal ng pamasahe pero kalahati lang ng pwet mo yung nakaupo. yung ang mahal ng gasolina tapos di mo naman nasusulit kasi ilang oras ka nakastuck sa traffic. haay, it's indeed more fun in the philippines. this is why mas maganda na talagang mag-freelance na lang or maghanap ng work na fully remote. malaki na matitipid mo, less stress pa.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/wljuen/traffic_is_being_normalized_in_the_philippines/,11 08 2022

"Ridiculous ""tips"" from a supposed immigration officer has been making rounds on Facebook.","kailangan mo ba talaga magdala ng yearbook? 🥇 from diy travel philippines group ********** hi, i’m posting again as promised. been with the bureau for a decade now, been assigned to different ports as well. disclaimer: everything you will read in this post are all about my personal experiences sa counter. you’re free to compare me from ios you have encountered, but i will not engage in negative comments or bashing.☺️ also, you cannot use this post as basis na ma clear kayo sa immig counters because everything will be based on the totality of circumstance on the day of your travel. also sa mga ios na makakabasa neto, bahala na kayo to check on yourselves. this is how i perform my job. you’re welcome to make this a big deal, raise your eyebrows, shrug or follow some of my procedures. hahaha whichever. so here comes nothing! first time travelers: 1.) dress comfortably and appropriately. why? because yes, your attire matters. judgemental talaga kami, guys. (hindi ko naman nilalahat🤣) comfortably= yung parang mag chichill ka lng with friends (shirt, jeans, sneakers, perhaps a jacket) bsta hindi yung prang rarampa ka sa stage or mag didinner with heart e. avoid heels, pls. nakakapagod tumakbo sa airport especially pag final call na. a legit or frequent traveller knows this kaya mostly, nka flats yan cla or sneakers. approriately means, nka depende to sa country of destination mo. example, singapore yung ticket mo, pero destination mo talaga is dubai and ayaw mong malaman to ni io. pero kasi, december alis mo, winter sa dubai, mej malamig, nka jacket ka na may furfur. char. eh hndi namin malamig sa singapore. so ma o-offload ka just because of the jacket?😭 diba? do the math. pro tip: pag 1st time to travel abroad, book like a 3d2n trip muna then bring a 10-15kg of clothes. iwasan muna ang change outfit na mga 100 times.😑 bcs the heavier your luggage is, the more suspish you become. the shorter your travel dates, the more legit you look as a tourist. 2.) if traveling alone, sa queue pa lng, take slow and paced breaths. calm down, stop checking your phone every minute. why? kasi kaming mga officers, even though we conduct inspections in an enclosed counters, we are particular of the demeanor ng mga na sa pila namin. we profile you kahit na sa queue ka pa lng. everything, from your shoes, to your bags up to how you behave yourself. we don’t do this to outbound filipinos alone, we also do the same strategy sa mga foreigners coming in. also, if you keep on checking your phone, i have this presumption na may kausap ka for instructions. usually kasi, mga victims ng human trafficking, may kausap yan, coaching them every step of the way hanggang makalusot sa counter. if i see you fidgeting with your phone, i already have a prejudice towards you. refer kita for secondary inspection. also, using of electronic devices is prohibited sa immigration area. if traveling with a group, queue properly. wag mag chismis sa pila or talk too loud because you are contributing to the noise pollution around you. and yung strangers na kasabay nyo sa pila, naiingayan din sa inyo. hahaha 3.) do not, i said, do not place your printed docs sa plastic or brown envelop tapos hahawakan nyo. no. please don’t. put all your documents inside your bag. hindi kayo mag aapply ng work, i personally dont want to see a legit tourist na may hawak na envelop. huhu that envelop for me is already a screaming red flag. and pag may need ka e-abot sa officer, remove it from any concealed envelop. kasi baka may pera ka na naiwan sa loob and the officer might feel insulted with it, baka akalain bribe money.🤭 4.) while nka pila, just hold your passport, remove mo yung passport jacket ksi it wont fit in our scanners. and may mga nahuhulog from your jacket inserts tapos kasalanan pa namin pag nawala.nkklk🤣 anyway, hold your passports, insert your departure card and your boarding pass in any page of your passport, kng may visa ka, dun mo e-insert na page. at yan lng ang ibigay mo pag dating mo sa counter ni io. nothing more, nothing less. pag may hinanap sayo, dat’s the time you present your printed docs or ids. pag hindi, do not proactively present. 5.) re: phone check we are legally armed and protected to do this. your rights to privacy is suspended sa borders, whether outbound or inbound. personally for me, hanggang convo and pictures lang ako. and i don’t do the scrolling and never ko hinahawak ang phone. i would ask the passenger to do the scrolling, photo gallery, convo. i don’t check bank accounts, i am a bit uncomfortable with the thot of checkin people’s money. and tbh, wala akong kakilala or nakasabay na officer on my shift that checks online bank accounts. printed, yes meron, kasi embassies also ask for bank statements, if we apply for visas. and those saying na may printed copies naman bakit mag checheck pa ng email. well, you wouldnt believe what people can fraudulently do just to present coes. or fabricate company ids pra mapaniwala kami na employed siya dito. 6.) for males specifically. disclaimer: this is my personal discretion. let’s say, your profile is a family man, meaning, you have a wife and kids here in ph, you’re traveling alone for a holiday. or to just visit a family member abroad, you think maniniwala kami? mag eenjoy ka kaya without your family with you?🥺 our initial judgement will be, you will work there. and there is nothing wrong with that. pro tip: when the officer asks you the reason for travel, and kung totoo naman talaga dat you have a relative abroad within 4th degree, you can say that you will visit the relative and say “at kung may mahanap na trabaho po dun, baka may chance po na mag ta-trabaho dun” i am not saying this will guarantee you can get thru that counter, but i personally appreciate an honest answer and i will gladly stamp your passport knowing you are doing what it takes for your family. hindi namin kami heartless, guys.❤️ p.s i only apply this to male travelers but never to females. why? because women and children, as study shows, are more prone to human trafficking incidents. that’s reality. this is not discrimination. and i stand firm on this kasi hindi ko kinaya when i encountered an abused filipina who was sent home from saudi. hindi sya makausap ng matino as in sobrang traumatic nangyari sa kanya. she pretended to be a tourist bound for hk but jumped to ksa, instead. for previously offloaded: 1.) bring as much as possible yung hiningi ng io sayo when you were offloaded. don’t simply base your experience with someone else’s kasi hndi talaga kayo 100% the same situation. even sa akin, minsan, i would vouch for a friend na aalis ng bansa, may times na napapayagan, meron ding times na hindi talaga. and halos the same lng naman ang situation, it so happened na by the book c io, meaning kung ano yung rules, the officer sticks and adheres to it kasi yun naman talaga ang dapat. may times lng na kagaya ko na mejo relaxed yung approach sa rules, maybe it goes with age or tagal sa work. depende. but you know, everything happens for a reason. for freelancers: i wouldn’t mind if you don’t have your itr, what’s important are your ✔️ticket ✔️hotel booking ✔️coe with compensation ✔️simple itinerary, yung gawa mo for family traveling together: immediate family only for example: father, mother, kids, you may queue in one counter. isama mo na lng din or paunahin mo na yung grandparents then you stand behind them. yung kapatid mo na may sariling, pamilya, hayaan mong mag queue din separately. pero kng mag-isa lng sya, den by all means, isabay mo. hold all passports together tas before mo ibagay sa officer, ask mo muna kung okay lng na buong angkan nyo ang magpapa clear sa kanya. we’re usually not that strict pag family. pro tip: if previously offloaded ka, malaki ang possibility na makakaalis ka if kasama mo family mo. of course, you’ll be interviewed again just so may mailagay kmi sa system to justify your travel, pero 90%, goods ka na. kaya, isama ang buong pamilya pra masaya! i have seen a comment pala na nonsense dw ang question ni io na “bakit doon ang punta mo?” (referring to the country of destination.) this is answerable by either, you have family there, you’re meeting a friend, you wanted to see a spot you’ve seen in a movie, you wanted to try something na sikat dun sa country. diba? possibilities are endless. so dont be sarcastic and say on your mind na “eh dun gusto ko eh, pakialam mo ba.” we would ask this to gauge your knowledge of the place you’re supposed to visit. paano pala kung singapore yung ticket mo tapos gusto mo mag disney land? eh universal studios lng meron cla dun. nasa hk ung dl.😑 if may friend ka na io, if ka-close mo talaga, message mo na before your flight (hindi kami manghihingi ng pasalubong, pramisssss😂) at kung legit nman tlaga na mag to-tour ka lng.. wag na wag ka mag mi-message asking for help pag na offload ka na kasi yung record mo nasa system na, hassle makipag usap just to clear your records, guys. hindi lahat ng nasa airport ay taga bureau of immigration, so if you have bad experience with other employees, wag nyo namin kami e-blame just because kami yung last na nakausap nyo.😅🥹 be courteous and respectful at all times. we appreciate those mababait na passengers and well-mannered kasi marami talaga ang rude and feeling entitled. well, it goes both ways din nman. meron din mga ios na ganto.🤭🙈 share it to help more peeps. save this post as well. enjoy your travel.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/121xioi/ridiculous_tips_from_a_supposed_immigration/,25 03 2023

Lubog ang pilipinas dahil sa basurang decision making,"sa tingin ko dapat tayo mamuhunan talaga sa edukasyon, especially the early grade levels. maybe sneak in someone or few who know what they’re doing, na may pakialam at pag aalaga sa ginagawa nya/nila, and transform the whole education curriculum into something more effective and efficient. that way the general masses are given the right tools to making the country a less worse place to live in. i feel yung kakulangan sa edukasyon, kawalan ng gana sa edukasyon, inkompetensya ng edukasyon, at kakulangan sa pagpapahalaga ng edukasyon yung ugat talaga ng paghihirap ng bansa natin. a better education = better decision making. i think halos lahat ng hirap na dinadanas natin dahil sa poor decision making na mababaliktad ng edukasyon. lack of family planning/sex ed: mas mahirap(financially, and overall) na family dynamic; lack of financial education: overall terrible management of priorities in and/of finances. which leads to utang dito utang doon nang hindi pinag iisipan ng masinsinan (im not saying loaning is bad. i’m saying loaning should be utilized in better ways) madaling ma enganyo sa easy money kaya madali mascam ng malakihan( terrible investments due to, again, lack of financial education). lack of interest in proper self-education and proper information gathering (from politics, to money, news and such) for their decisions. kaya puro mga burnik at trapo yung napapaupo sa gobyerno. and most of all due to lack if education nga, the lack of foresight. napaka short sited ng mga pilipino im general sa lahat ng aspeto ng buhay. gusto yung sarap agad kahit panandalian lamang. election? botohin natin yung magbibigay satin ng 2k para pandagdag natin sa buwan na to. ipaayos ang bahay at iiimprove ang negosyo ngayon nagkapera tayo sa maliit na business natin? pambili natin ng kotse na secondhand na di dn naman magagamit pang dagdag income, matagal ko na kase dream ang magkakotse. mag aral? wag ka na mag aral mabuti pa tulungan mo kamo dito para may dagdag tayo pera. sex protection? wag na mas masarap raw eh hehe. i know this statement is not backed by research pa, medjo pagod ako para maghanap, on break ako from studying kaya not now muna hehe. nakita ko lang kase mga news about sa state ng politics dito and nakakatawa lang talaga bat ganto namumuno ng bansa natin. nakakapanlumo lang talaga. di ko alam kung incompetent lang talaga education system natin or sadya lang tayo pinapanatiling bobo para mas madaling mahila sa ilong. i know these problems are more complex than i make it to be. and i acknowledge that. i know as of now it’s wishful thinking. but it’s obvious. the people that live in this country are just suffering because of terrible decision makingg.

Just diagnosed with HIV,"hi. i (23m) just got diagnosed with hiv. i will still undergo a confirmatory test on wednesday to see if i really do have the virus. i only took 2 rapid antigen tests and they came back positive, and the test kits are highly accurate. when i took my first antigen test on august 20 and got the result, it was a weird feeling. i have been very sickly for almost a year now, and now that i have my results, i finally know why. i just want to get this off my chest. i have already accepted my diagnosis and i'm glad that receiving my diagnosis wasn't so bad as others. maybe it has not sunken it yet? idk. i hope that i'd really come into terms with this chronic illness. what's really bothersome for me is, i am a person with big, big dreams. i have always been looking forward to the future. right now, i am a graduating student practicing physical therapy. the thing is, when i got my diagnosis, i wasn't afraid of how deadly or how potentially life-threatening it is. instead, i was more afraid of how it can potentially impact my life from now on. i've always had a map, a direction of where i wanted to go in my life, but now, idk what to do anymore. i don't know what kinds of opportunities that were just stripped off from me, and i am yet to find out. i definitely know that life is going to be different from now on, and nothing has prepared me for this. i can't even tell my parents about this. from my family, i just told my sister. luckily, treatment is going to be for free and that's convenient so i don't have to rely on my parents. huge shoutout to loveyourself! they have been amazing in delivering their service. it brings me comfort to just see how passionate the people who are working there. as for me, i'm still yet to see. it's going to be a different life from now on. i know i got this, i just have to continue moving forward update: hello, i've read all of your comments! thank you all so much for your affirming words 🙏🏼 i'm very glad na i sparked this discourse and people are getting educated by it! i feel so much better than yesterday when i posted it, it's just amazing na there are understanding people! i would just like to answer some very common questions from the comments: how did you acquire it? - i engage in very risky sexual behaviors. mostly m2m, and i do it unprotected sometimes. mostly oral lahat, wasn't really into penetrative sex. for 3 years, i've mostly engaged in oral sex lang with people i met online and usually ako yung *insertive* sa role. since then, twice lang ako nakapag anal but puro protected. i'm thinking na maybe i got it through oral sex and take note ah na it's rare to acquire it via oral sex. this is a lesson to all! what were your symptoms? - for almost a year, i was very sickly talaga. september last year, i contracted amoebiasis and i didn't get treated for it until january when i was hospitalized due to sever malnutrition and dehydration. they did try to rule out hiv while i was treated, but since i had a primary diagnosis at that time, they didn't bother testing hiv nalang. over those months, onting ulan lang, i'd get sick na. it was every week na i'd get a fever! again, i did not think na it was because of hiv since i contracted amoebiasis at the time. the reason why i delayed my treatment lang was sobrang hirap kumuha ng med cert from my school. plus, i didn't want to make up for any missed activities or exams and at that time it was hell months sa gawain and all. they had to isolate me for 2 weeks kasi i had diarrhea and it was a symptom of covid (i know, pretty messed up yung clinic namin). i know it's very ironic of me, a medical course student, who chose to be sick than getting treated dahil lang sa school works. fast forward to february this year when i was discharged, it seemed like i never really got better. i was still having stomach problems and my oral thrush came back, even after weeks of taking prescription medications for it. i had enlarged lymph nodes around my neck to which my doctor prescribed me with antibiotics and nag shrink din naman yung lymph nodes ko. since feb ang masasabi ko lang na pinaka complaint ko is just the fatigue. i didn't have the energy that i used to have. and i just notice na i'm weaker. maffeel mo talaga na something is wrong sa body mo. that's the best way to describe it. what made you decide to get tested? - it was a message from the universe. may nakita lang ako na ad sa facebook by self care about free testing kits that they give out and get delivered to your doorstep. i ordered mine ng august 13 and dumating yung kit ng august 20 (you decide the date that's most convenient for you cause you have to sign some paperwork before it gets handed to you). i was curious lang din to know my status. how much will the treatment cost? - free. as long as may philhealth insurance ka, it's gonna be for free. don ako sa loveyourself sa shaw boulevard pumunta. but, some testing procedures are not going to be for free. i will update on this soon since i will be going back to the doctor ng wednesday. but treatment is generally for free",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/162t88p/just_diagnosed_with_hiv/,27 08 2023
SLEEPER EFFECT: Kumbakit hindi maipaliwanag ng Pinoy ang pagkagusto kay BBM,"nagsimula ito sa cambridge analytica.... para marefresh tayo sa **facebook+cambridge analytica scandal:** mula sa ibat ibang whistle blower, nalaman natin na since 2014, ang cambridge analytica ay nagnenok ng milyong milyong fb profile data. 2nd sa us ang pilipinas sa pinakamalaking data na naharvest. mula sa mga data, gumawaga sila ng tinatawag na social media behavioral profiling ng users. ang sinomang may hawak ng data ay may kakayahang i-predict kung anong isyu ang magpapareact sayo. anong klaseng mensahe at ilang trigger bago ka mag react. kung paano ka aamuin o gagalitin. “cambridge analytica will try to pick whatever mental weakness or vulnerability that we think you have, and try to warp your perception of what’s real around you.” - christopher wylie ang operasyon ayon sa mga ulat sa us ay centered around deception, false grassroot support, at strategy that borders on electronic brainwashing lumabas din ang investigation ng uk channel 4 news kung saan ang journalist ay nag undercover, nagkunwaring kliyente at in-exposed ang taktika ng cambridge analytica kung paano sila nagpapanalo ng kanilang kliyente sa ibat’ ibang bansa. dito lumabas ang isyu ng fake news, fake videos, misinformation, troll army channels, panunuhol at iba pang dirty tactics. ang whistle blower na si christopher wylie mula sa fb ay nagsabing ang pilipinas di umano ang ginawang “petri-dish” or testingan ng ca. dahil sa dami ng fb users sa pinas, haba ng oras na ginugugol ng mga users, at maluwag o kwestyunableng batas, sakto ang pinas upang gawing testingan. ang partner ng ca sa pinas ay ang istrarehiya inc. ang chairman nito, na ayon sa ulat ng rappler ay, taga davao at “family friend” ni pangulong duterte. maroon ding mga key personality sa kampo ng kampanya ni duterte ang lantad na may kaugnayan sa ca lalo na sa ceo alexander nix. ang ilan ay nagkaroon ng posisyon sa administrasyon matapos ang halalan. yung iba ngayon ay nasa ibang kampo bilang tagakampanya (like benayo ng isko camp). ang whistle blower na si britanny kaiser dating empleyado ng ca ang nagsabi ring inugnayan sila noon ng mga marcos para sa rebranding ng pamilya. nuong 2019, bagamat may mangilan-ngilang news outlet ang nagcover sa scandal na ito, hindi naman pumutok sa masa. ipinagkibit balikat or dinisregard. walang senate inquiry dito sa pilipinas. kung meron mang umalmang mga akademista or intellectual na nag ingay, walang nakaramdam. search : “did cambridge analytica use filipinos’ fb data to help duterte win? and “why the cambridge anayltica scandal matters to filipino” rappler yt at leloy claudio **paano tayo nalalason** ayon kay alexander nix na ceo ng cambridge analytica at ayon kay pompee laviña ay kanyang impluwensya (btw social media director ni pangulong duterte nuong 2016, pagtapos ay itinalagang undersecretary, department of tourism. former sss commissioner). *“it’s no good fighting an election campaign on the facts… because actually it’s all about emotions. the biggest mistake political parties make is that they attempt to win the argument rather than locating the emotional centre of the issue, the concern, and speaking directly to that.”* halimbawa ay “yolanda funds”, or “junel…junel…” or “meron presidentiable na nagko-coccaine”. habang nakukuha ng mensahe ang emosyon mo, hindi mahalaga kung ano ang facts or kung meron man. ang tinatawag na discounting cue sa isang mensahe ay mga elementong pampakwela, kamangha-mangha o source na kaduda-duda para hindi seryosohin ng audience. halimbawa ay tallano gold, or babayaran ni marcos ang utang ng pinas. or mga spliced video na alam mong pinutol-putol pero maaliw ka sa panonood. dahil sa scientific at data driven ang kampanya, epektibo ang psychographic segmentation na pagtarget ng mga ito sa audience. sa paulit-ulit na exposure sa mensahe, na may kasamang discounting cue, sa kalaunan ay magkakaroon ka ng preference toward sa mensahe. ito ang tinatawag na sleeper effect. ang sleeper effect “describes the way a message, when paired with some sort of discounting cue, has a delayed impact on the recipient.” since 2015 ay nagtatanim na ng sleeper effect ang mga fiddler ng fake news, disinformation, misinformation, trolls at iba pa. ito rin ang dahilan kumbakit hindi maipaliwanag ng isang botante ang kanyang pagkagusto sa isang napiling kandidato. sa tulong ng algorithm ng social media flatform, mas lalo itong nagiging efektibo. kapag bumisita ka sa isang fake news page or group, kahit hindi ka mag react or magcomment, tatandaan ito ng algo. at next time, padadaanin nyang muli ang content ng nasabing page sa atensyon mo. (imagine ang snetflix account mo. may mga palabas silang suggested para sayo at may percentage kung gaano ito ka-match sa preferences mo. ganoon din sa social media, at mas hyper) once mamihasa ka mag click, magbasa or manood sa mga katulad na page, mas madalas na itong dadaan sa feed mo. and syempre sooner or later, magrereact ka na, or mag sye-share. later on, kapag nagshare or nag post ka na, committed ka na rito. kapag may nag like, react or comment, mas naba-validate tumataas ang dopamine mo. uulitin mo. halimbawa naman na hindi ka nagsusubscribe sa mga fake news page, pero ang mga friends mo ay nagpopost or nagsheshare, dadaan pa rin ito sa iyong atensyon. habang dumadami sila, nagbabago ang environment mo. hindi mo namamalayan, nagiging normal na sa environment natin ang mensahe. ang behavior. ang paraan nilang mangatwiran. kapag lumaon, kapag may ipe-present sayong opinion na taliwas sa post mo ay mahihirapan ka nang tangapin. denial is real. kapag may magkamaling sumaway or pumuna sayo ng pabalagbag, magkakaroon ka lalo ng resistance. ang “kuyog” ng mga troll sa comment section ay traumatic. ang dalawang goal nito ay una, para patahimikin ka. pangalawa, para panghinaan ng loob ang sinumang magtatangkang magcomment pa ng pasalungat. dalawa rin ang biktima nito. una, ang nakuyog. pangalawa ang karaniwang user na gumaya sa behavior ng troll. may satisfaction nararamdaman ang mga gumagawa nito na maiuugnay sa sadism. lalo na kapag pumapalag pa ang kadebate. mas masarap diinan at durugin. ang fake news ay hindi kabobohan kundi scientific at kalkuladong galaw ng kalaban. tinatawanan na lang tayo ng orchestrator ng troll farm habang nagmamaktol tayo sa comment section ng rappler. kamakailan, ang whistle blower naman na si frances haugen ay nagsabing mas lalala ang sitwasyon dahil sa algorithm ng mga social media mismo ang magtutulak sa users sa extremes ng kanyang interes. kung nahihilig ka sa kpop or anime, lalo ka nyang ie-expose sa mga ito. kaya malaking peligro ito sa mga depressive at may suicidal tendencies. ganun din sa fake news. kaya naman lalong sumisikat at yumayaman ang mga fake news channels. at dahil sa may pera dito… mas darami pa sila. at habang dumarami sila, mas magiging popular. imagine kung gaano ito kaakit-akit sa mga politiko. lalo na sa pulitikong walang napatunayan at kapangyarihan ng popularidad lang ang aasahan. imagine ang dami ng financer na mamumuhunan dito kung may control sila sa politiko. theoretically, critical thinking ang depensa sa anumang maling inpormasyon o sa halina ng advertise. pero napakahirap ituro ng critical thinking, lalo na sa highschool. mahirap na nga sa loob ng pamantasan, mas lalo pa sa online class… mas lalo pa sa labas. elementary pa lamang ang user ng fb ay babad na ito sa social media. teen ager ang mas babad kesa sa adult na naghahanapbuhay or busy sa gawaing bahay. sila ang pinakaunang maapektuhan ng lason sa social media. right now, we are out class and out gunned ng kalaban. sa us at europeong bansa, kaya nilang ipatawag, imbestigahan, parushan at pagbayarin ang pamunuan ng app. nagbayad ng fine ang fb/meta at nagdeklara ng bankruptcy ang cambridge analytica. natalo si trump nuong sumunod na eleksyon. kahit social media capital of the world daw ang pinas, hindi mangyayari ito dito sa atin. sino tayo kay mark zuckerberg. wala tayong jurisdiction sa kanya ngunit may opisina ang meta sa pinas. bakit walang mga “investigation in aid of legislation”? maraming dapat pag-usapan: ø bakit walang parusa ang fake news? ayon sa policies ng fb: “we do not remove false news from facebook but we significantly reduce its distribution by showing it lower in news feed.” ø bakit hindi ikinakategoryang “fraud” ang fake news? kung ang ntc ay iniimbestigahan ang spamming, false advertise at scammer, bakit tila walang kahalintulad nito sa social media? ø dapat bang gawing criminal offense ang pag gawa at pagpapakalat ng fake news? halimbawa ay medical fake news? economic fake news? ø batay sa operasyon ng socmed messaging dito sa pinas, maituturing ba itong electronic branwashing? ø maituturing bang suppression ng malahayang pagpapahayag kung iki-criminalize ang fake news? aminadong hirap tayong sagutin at pagpasyahan ang mga isyung ito ngunit kailangan nating humakot ng mga eksperto, pag usapan, pagdebatehan, mag-ingay sa pambansang entablado. maliban dito, may mga basic, ez at yakang yakang steps sa part ng meta na kung tutuusin ay mapakalaking bagay sa kaayusan social media environment. wag nang sa sabihing “social responsibility”… ø bakit tila reactive lang ang kayang gawin ng meta laban sa mga fake news at troll farms. meaning kalat na ang fake news, naishare na or na copy. nakapanira or nakapang-uto na ito bago lang nila maaaksyonan. ø ang bawat app ay may logs na tinawatag. mula sa data nito, maaring malamang agad-agad in real time, kung may bots na nag ooperate sa platform. halimbawa: 1) duplicate account 2) ip ng users kung magkakapareho. kung rehistrado sa isang pribadong kumpanya. 3) geolocation ng ip (kung dagsa ang taga ibang bansa or may particular na bansa ang may significant increase sa isang particular na page or post.) 4) count ng spam messages sa x length of time 5) at marami pa. sobrang simple lamang nito, sa pamamagitan ng simpleng program na patatakbuhin kahit sa excel or gsheet lang, maaring ma-detect ang lahat ng ito ng real time, mag auto alert at maari ring maglagay ng sanctions depende sa parameters. siguradong mayroon mas sopistikadong version nito ang isang kumpanyang kasing laki ng meta. ngunit bakit hindi natin maramdaman na inaaksyunan nila ang robotic behavior? bakit wala or hindi hiningian si fb/meta philippines ng statement nuong nagkaroon ng clamor sa mga presidential survey ng mga page? dapat ay magkaroon ng batas upang panagutin ang financer ng troll farms. pero hindi papasa ang batas na ito kung ang gumagawa ng batas ang syang unang nakikinabang. dapat ding malaman ng publiko ang istratehiya kung paano tayo nalalason. ang lantad na stratehiya ay hindi masyadong epektibo. maliban na lang kung ang adik ka. kahit alam mong masama sayo ay hindi mo napipigilan. at nakakaadik ang social media. **ang end game** kapag natalo ang mga kandidatong may troll farm, magdadalawang-isip nang umulit ang mga financer ng fake news army. imagine kung ang limpak-limpak nilang puhunan ay tinalo lang ng boluntirismo. kapag nanalo ang pamunuang walang utang na loob sa financer ng troll farm, malaki ang tyansang maari nang usigin ang financer at operator nito. kaya kailangang manalo ang boluntirismo upang madiskarir or madiscourage ang mga financer ng troll farms. ang pagkatalo ng boluntirismo ay panalo ng industriya ng public opinion for sale. otherwise, kakailanganin na ng psychological revolution ang bansa.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/tkm1b0/sleeper_effect_kumbakit_hindi_maipaliwanag_ng/,23 03 2022

PH Hospitals,"guys may tanong ako with regards sa hospitals sa ph. konting story time, nung 2020 nag resign ako (25m) sa work ko kasi nagkasakit ako. sabi ng doctor ko sakin gerd daw, then niresetahan ako ng gamot. naubos na lang lahat ng ipon ko sa pag bili ng gamot and check up pero until now di parin nag cchange yung mga nararamdaman ko, konting improvement pero largely the same. at the same time, gusto ko sana magpunta ng hospital kaso yung parents ko ang laging sagot sakin is yung typical na ""kaka ... mo kasi yan"", may phobia yung parents ko sa mga hospital. as much as possible ""thoughts and prayer"" ang panglaban nila. may one time pa na nagkacovid ako then nag sslip in-and-out na ko ng malay. di sila tumawag ng ambulansya kasi daw ""magkakasakit lang ako doon sa hospital"" then after some months pinagtawanan pa yung sinabi kong ""dalahin mo na ko sa hospital di ako makahinga"" sa harap ng buong family reunion which by the way, di ko naalalang sinabi ko since pawala wala na yung malay ko and sobrang hirap huminga. paano na ba yung next na pwede kong gawin? since walang wala na ko. pag nagpunta ako ng hospital mag isa magagamot parin ba ako? thanks sa mga sagot!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/15b9xtl/ph_hospitals/,27 07 2023
"Requirement ba na kapag government employee, toxic?","last year, nagsubmit ako ng documents para sa tin dun sa rdo ng company na naghire sakin. weird na nga na ako pa yung nagasikaso since alam ko dapat company yun pero anyway, unang punta ko, hindi inaccept kasi wala raw proof of employment. humingi ako ng certificate of employment sa company which is hindi rin nabigay agad so ilang days pa ako nakabalik sa rdo. sa pangalawang punta ko, tinanggap na pero sinabihan ako nung officer ng ""hindi pa ba kayo naaaccept dati, ma'am??"" na parang ako pa yung tanga hahaha. natandaan niya ako pero hindi natandaan na hindi nila inaccept yung documents ko from before, so napaisip tuloy ako kung necessary ba talaga na kumuha pa ko ng certificate of employment. anyway, at least tinanggap. wait ko raw yung email nila tapos balik daw ako para makuha yung receiving copy. ang ineexpect ko is one day process lang 'to. pinapabalik pa pala ako. note lang na taga-bulacan pa ako and sa makati yung rdo. irita lang pero okay sige, palampasin nalang ulit dahil ayoko mahawa sa stress nila. last year pa yan. umabot ng 2023, walang email. i decided to search for their customer service number, at dun ko palang nakausap ulit yung officer na tumanggap ng documents ko. pagkacall namin, dun niya palang inasikaso yung documents. at siya pa ang annoyed. pinoint out niya pa na may issue sa address na nilagay ko sa form (may second name kasi yung street namin at baka yung isa yung narerecognize ng system). kaya raw hindi niya inasikaso agad. so ako pa yung may kasalanan? eh kung inasikaso kaya nila nung nandun ako mismo para naclarify nila agad sakin? pagkaprocess niya, sinabihan ako na kunin ko nalang daw mismo yung receiving copy ng tin ko sa office nila. so luwas ulit ako, gusto ko na kasi talagang matapos to hahaha eto na. kukunin ko nalang. sabi sakin ng kausap kong officer no need na raw na magdala ng any document since pipirma nalang daw ako tapos makukuha ko na yung tin. pagdating ko dun, ibang officer ang sumalubong sakin, so inexplain ko na kukunin ko nalang yung receiving copy. ginisa ba naman ako at inask kung nasan daw yung email notification ko, which is wala nga akong natanggap. ""so saan proof mo na may documents ka na sa amin at kukunin mo nalang yung tin?"" anak ng pucha, edi na sa inyo?? kung hindi pa ako nagname drop dun sa kausap kong officer at sinabing kausap ko na siya sa call, uuwi pa siguro ulit akong luhaan. nung kaharap ko na yung officer na nagasikaso ng documents ko, siya pa nga ang galit. nagpho-phone pa sa harap ko habang hinihintay akong matapos pumirma sa form. anyway, halata palang sa vibes ng lugar na yun na toxic environment sila at mahilig mang-power trip. nakakasuka. alam ko na on my end, dapat nangulit na ako sa kanila nang mas maaga para hindi umabot until 2023 kasi for sure, hindi sila kikilos hanggat hindi ka nangulit at nagmakaawa. pero jusko naman, anong klaseng environment ba to? walang kapaki-pakialam sa kapwa. walang kagana-gana magaccommodate. halatang marami sa kanila, ayaw yung trabaho nila.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/10eznve/requirement_ba_na_kapag_government_employee_toxic/,18 01 2023
Konsensiya at Awa ang pumipigil,"kapag nakakakita ako ng ages 35+ na babae at lalaki na di stable ang income tapos naganak, nanlulumo ako. sa situation kasi namin late 30s na nagasawa mga magulang namin at di rin nakareceive ng proper education. so they aren't just incapable financially, they too cannot set a good example to us lalo na nung formative years. my father brag about the anti-social behavior he committed in the past. he is ill-tempered, tamad, at irresponsible. you can really tell that the proper ways of doing things. like pag nagsuklay sa jeep meaning nun malandi ka na. imbis na turuan kami magmahalan, madalas sasabihan niya na gantihan kapatid ko pagnagaaway ganun. our mama naman, she did everything for us to the point na nalosyang siya, as in maaga kumulubot ang skin. medyo timid at consintidor type siya kaya hinayaan niya maging batugan tatay namin. hanggang hindi na kinaya ng health niya. so ayun na nga, ang ending mukha kami laging mga basang sisiw nuon. lagi kami nabubully kasi poor and also most of our clothes were hand-me-downs. we were all thriving in school and gave extra effort nung students pa kami to the point na sinampal kami lahat ng kahirapan kasi nakita naman how wide the gap is, how insufficient we are financially. thankfully, we were able to graduate in one of the well-known public uni in the country. we are all working now but we are all still stucked. ganito pala pag mahirap ka, ang hirap din umangat. lalo na pag ang dkait ng parent mo umaabot ng more than 35k a month. ang dami pang extra gastos. hospitalization, check-ups, at iba pang needs. ang tagal mo na tumutulong but nothing seems to change. minsan gusto ko na mabuhay sa paraan na gusto ko. pero kasi wala talagang kayang makasuport kundi ako lang. may sakit din kasi mga kapatid ko. nakakalungkot lang. tapos minsan ang hirap pa kasama mga kawork lalo na manager, lahat issue. ang difficult na mga tao. hayss. still, i'm still fighting my battles fairly. magdusumikap pa rin ako hanggang sa makahanap ng pagkakataong mabuhay para sa sarili ko. yun lang sorry haba.. wala mapagkwentuhan e.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/16u61sb/konsensiya_at_awa_ang_pumipigil/,28 09 2023
"Opinion: In some cases and ways, mas homophobic pa pinays kesa sa male pinoys.","first of all, i was inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/philippines/comments/107679q/why_does_no_one_address_maletomale_sexual/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) sa post nito, andame nagsasabe sa comments na ang homophobic raw ng straight guys. i argue otherwise; in my experience, honestly lang, alam ko ang weird and napaka-counter-intuitive pero mas madame akong kilalang homophobes na straight females kesa sa straight males. crazy, right???!! sobrang dameng beses ko na na-encounter yung mga babaeng nagsasabe na ""omg ang gwapo naman. sayang bakla pala."" and ""ano ba yan andame nang mga bakla. konti nalang mga ""tunay na lalake"" sa panahon ngayon. need i remind you, hindi porket good-looking or attractive yung isang tao, hindi sila obliged or/and hindi entitled mga babae na maging straight yung mga taong yun. subtly napansin ko lanv all over the years kasi ever since elementary ko pa to naririnig, ngayon ko lang na-realize na napaka-homophobic pala ng statements na yan - again - these come from girls. not men. another example is nao-overhear ko lang sa arguments between girls and gays are that pagnatatalo sa usapan yung straight girls, final card nila is ""bakit? tunay na babae ka ba?"" and similar lines. again, wala ako pake. hindi ko kasalanan nao-overhear ko arguments nila sa classroom or in public pero ngayon ko lang din na-realize, parang sobrang taas ng tingin ng mga females just because of their gender and thus homophobic. andame ko din neighbors and friends of relatives na napaka-straight up ang baba ng tingin and diring diri sa mga gay people. one female friend of a relative of mine once said derogatory remarks sa gay tito namin nung may party a few years ago. isa ko pang babaeng classmate na religious noong senior high school sabe (hindi ko matandaan exact words) ""lalake ka talaga, sis. pagna-realize mo sa bible and pag narinig mo calling ni god, malalaman mo na hindi totoo mga bakla."" or something ganun. also, this female classmate rin nagsabe ng ""ay hindi ka marunong magbasketball? hindi ka naman barbie (bakla)?"" like holy shit. (and am very aware that other female pinays think like this, given our upbringing as filipinos). so it may seem like straight females pa ang mas sympathetic sa lgbt community at first glance, it isn't always the case. lahat ng straight guys na kakilala ko either walang pake sa mga gay guys and may isa pa nga ako kakilala na he's a straight guy pero halos..

An open letter to the company I work for and all the companies amidst covid-19 outbreak.,"disclaimer: from a friend that works in the said company. (you'll know which one after reading). she said that she doesn't have the guts to post this so i'm doing this for her as a favor. enjoy. pasintabi po sa mga officemates ko na makakabasa nito. since nobody is speaking about this matter, i’ll do the honors. di ko na siguro kailangang pang sabihin specifically kung saang company ako nagttrabaho at kung anong lob (line of business) ako currently assigned. basta sa 7th avenue, bgc taguig and i’m currently working for the largest and most popular video sharing platform in the world. \*wink wink\* secret lang natin yan. just to clarify things, hindi ko sinusulat to para magreklamo, magpapansin or mag inarte. i just think that someone has to say this. hindi na ako papasok. yup, you read that right. “eh, di ka naman pinipilit. sabi naman pag ayaw mo wag ka na pumasok.” yeah no, i get that. but i want you to understand what i’m about to say. first and foremost, i understand what you mean by business is business and sadly, everything that comes with it. you know what the saddest part is? hearing your managers say, bau. lindol, brown out, volcanic eruption, at kung ano ano pang calamities na nangyare noon, okay lang. natitiis pa naman. okay lang marinig ang bau. pero damn, not this time. business as usual. siguro that’s the thing with “private sectors are encouraged”. encouraged lang, not required. i’m not saying that the company i work for is incompetent or lacks planning or bcps, or lacks compassion, or lacks the characteristics of each and every company that offered and allowed its employees to work from home (including those that made them use their desktop computers), pero parang ganun na nga. cardinal health, kudos. saludo. hands down. different facebook posts that call centers here in the philippines can do this. let that sink in. ask your it friend why this shit is a big deal. this shit should be simple especially when you’re working for goo… ay, largest search engine in the world pala. but unfortunately, after several meetings and hear-says, they’re having issues with it. yeah, okay. sige, bigay namin sa inyo. “mahirap” e. hahaha. here’s what makes it worse. our “team” chose only 15 people to work from home. no, i’m not selected because first and foremost, this was not offered to everyone as an option. so pag naging oa ka, ganito ang ibig sabihin... hindi inoffer sa lahat kasi hindi lahat deserve maging safe. but as i said i didn’t care. i really didn’t. simple, i won’t go to work because it’s still an option. i don’t mind if i won’t get paid. i know the repercussion’s, and again, i’m fine with it. the 15 people were “management selected”. apparently, you have to be trustworthy, you have to probably have sucked enough to the managers to be selected as part of that group. and maybe you’re really that good. idk, if that’s the case then good for you. also, “syempre, kailangan maganda standing mo sa team, also kailangan mapagkakaitwalaan ka. nakabase din sa attendance. mahirap na, mamaya pumetiks ka lang sa bahay nyo”. non-verbatim. but you get it. hey, i’m all for that. believe me. i know some of us are not any of those things. but gago ka ba? that doesn’t mean that their life is more important than any of us. mamili ka ng favorite mo, tangina mo. wala kaming pake. pero gago ka, wag mong sasabihing sila lang ang may karapatang maging safe, kasi sila lang ang “trustworthy” it’s the last resort pa nga daw, sabi nung isang manager. pag malala na daw, tsaka lang itutuloy yung work from home scheme. hahahahahaha. putangina. edi wow (insert mimiyuh’s kulot voice) since the quarantine happened, more stories have circulated. there’s this one agent from a different lob. di nya sinabeng na expose sya sa covid. pero sa neighborhood nila, merong mga infected or lola nya, idk the whole story, but this is the gist. tapos di sya nag pacheck up, pumapasok pa din sya. hanggang sa nakonsenysa, sinabe daw sa manager. a few moments later, nag pakalat ng text message ata or message from messenger na di naman daw totoo. i hope its not true. i really do. because if it is, tapos tinago nyo lang not to cause panic or para pumasok pa din mga ahente nyo, you all will really have a special place in hell. ang masaklap pa nito, blinded ang mga ahente sa lahat ng nagaganap sa opisina. walang kahit anong announcements, walang kahit anong balita, walang kahit anong update ang nangagaling sa management. nakikiramdam ang mga ulol. tinitignan nila kung mairaraos ng hindi na ginagawan ng paraan. kasi mas magastos. hindi cost effective para sa kompanya. yung isa nga daw e nag pa dole na. pero nung nabalitaan ng management na nagpadole na, sinama sya dun sa listahan. 16 na ata sila. she stopped din naman after being included sa list. and that’s perfectly fine. i salute her for that bold move. it just goes to show na kung hindi aaksyon ang mga ahente, wala silang gagawin. patay malisya lang. tuloy ang business. galing ng damage control no? hahahaha. siguro, since they can work at home bec they are issued their own loaners, bec they’re managers, they don’t care anymore. i mean, di ko alam, siguro yung ibang managers pumapasok pa din. but that doesn’t help. wala kaming pake kung pumapasok pa rin kayo. that’s the risk you’re all willing to take. idk, i’m just assuming the worst because i’m a bad person. but hey, irereimburse nila worth 300 na pamasahe mo basta may receipt. that’s something, i guess????????? hahaha, puta. ewan ko lang ha. magutom na ako, malate na ako sa bills, wala akong sahurin. wala akong pake. “eh siguro nasasabi mo yan kasi kaya mong mabuhay ng walang trabaho”. blah blah blah. i won’t stop you from thinking what it is that you’re thinking while you reading this, if you’re reading this. may natira sa sahod ko last cut-off, pinambili ko ng supplies lahat. pag naubos, mangungutang ako. responsibilidad ko yon, kaya hayaan mo akong mamroblema dun. gawan mo ng paraan yung problema mo ngayon. point is, i’m not risking the safety of my family para lang ipakita sa mga tao sa kompanyang pinagttrabahuhan ko na maasahan ako sa oras ng sakuna. tangina nyo. di nyo ko maasahan, kasi walang maasahan sa inyo. business as usual nyo mga muka nyo, mga gago. if you’re not doing anything to help your employees, anong ineexpect nyo?

My Social Media Journey,"i remember review days para sa board exam nung 2016 naging active ako sa pakikipag talo/debate sa mga sumusuporta noon kay duterte. na ang drug addiction ay isang health problem and should be dealt with as such. maayos pa ko makipag debate at makipagtalo noon. kahit troll ang kausap ko magalang ako sumagot. appeal to emotion pa nga ginagawa ko minsan. mga susunod na buwan, taon, nakikipagtalo pa din ako sa mga troll or mga supporter ni duterte pero hindi na kagaya ng dati. pabalang na ko sumagot, nang aasar na ako. nang mamaliit na ko ng iq levels. i became toxic. alam kong tama yung pinaglalaban ko, pero yung way ko ng pakikipag sagutan nagiging toxic na. pag gago ang reply sa akin, mas gago ako sumagot. naging cycle. lahat ng kapalpakan ng gobyernong to aking pinuna objectively, at minsan naman ay parang bardagulan approach. akala ko kaya kong ikeep up yung ganung social media life. come 2020, pandemic, patuloy kong tinuligsa ang kapalpakan ng gobyerno natin especially on how they managed yung pandemic. we all know what happened, they fucked up. lost my grandmother because of covid. pero hindi lang pala yun yung nawala. nawalan din ako ng gana makipag sagutan sa fb. nawalan na ko ng gana mag fact check ng mga taong mali mali ang pinagsasabi. nawalan ako ng gana itama ang mga nakikita kong mali sa social media. hanggang 2022 hindi na ako nagsheshare masyado ng anything political na may sarili kong opinyon as caption. 2022, full support ako kay leni. wala ng ibang candidate pa ang mas qualified other than her in terms of track record and performance. pero hindi ako naging vocal about doon. hindi ako masyado nagshare ng achievements nya. di ako nakipagsagutan sa mga troll or fake news peddler to defend her. bakit nga ba ako nagbago? bakit nga ba ako napagod? dahil sa mga taong mas pinili mag bulag bulagan. mas pinili nila ang pride or ego nila kaysa maitama ang maling paniniwala. hindi ba totoo naman? nakakawalang gana magcorrect ng tama, makipag sagutan sa soc med kung at the end of the day sariling maling paniniwala pa din nila ang hawak nila. nakakawalang gana ipaglaban ang pilipinas kung ang mga mamamayan nito ang pilit ng sumisira sa kanya. that was me. not until recently natalo si leni. landslide. di ako makapaniwala na isang marcos ang mauuupo bilang pangulo. yung surname na pinatalsik ng mga matatapang at makabayan nating mga ninuno. di ko matanggap na nakalimot na ngang talaga ang mga pilipino. di ko matanggap na biktima ang pilipino ng isang makinarya na sila mismo ang target. patay na yung side of me na nakikipag laban sa social media para sa tama. para sa katotohanan. matagal ng patay yun. pero, ano itong nararamdaman ko? matapos kong pakinggan yung rosas na kanta kanina for the first time. something inside me is burning. nagngitngit ang ngipin ko sa galit, sa frustrations, sa panghihinayang. bakit nga ba ako nanahimik nung mga panahong kailangan akong mag ingay? hindi na worth it ipaglaban ang pilipinas. pero bakit nung narinig ko yung rosas may nasunog bigla sa loob ko. bakit? anong ibig sabihin nito? bago ko tapusin to, bigla ko lang naalala yung sinabi ni harvey dent sa the dark knight, ""the night is darkest just before the dawn. and i promise you, the dawn is coming"". maybe he's right.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/umlvmg/my_social_media_journey/,10 05 2022
"I want to improve and change our barangay by running into office, and here's my rant.","hindi naman sa walang ginagawa ang mga barangay officials at sangguniang kabataan (sk) officials dito sa amin, pero i feel na maraming pagkukulang. like ang mga methods of running the barangay is still old-school or traditional, you know what i mean. if there is a calamity like the pandemic, ang bagal ng response or hindi ready. halimbawa 'yong sk namin, walang nakahandang calamity fund/disaster fund nung start ng pandemic. in the middle of the pandemic, sobrang bagal ng response nila sa pagbibigay ng ayuda sa mga kabataan. 'yong ibang sk sa ibang barangay, nakapag-distribute na agad, nakapag-plano na. at sa ibang sk, feel na feel mo 'yong presence nila kahit na hindi mo kailangan ng tulong, masasabi mong well-accomplished 'yong plano at gawa nila. pero sa amin, ang taas ata ng ping ng mga sk. ang bagal gumalaw, tapos kulang kulang sila sa technicalities and proper handling ng mga projects at reports. alam nilang pandemic tapos di nila i-utilized 'yung social media at internet to reach out sa mga members nila ( i understand naman na hindi lahat may internet, they should use both traditional and non-traditional media to reach out). walang mga reports na naka-post sa bulletin boards, walang proper documentation ng mga meetings, programs, projects and everything, hay! and many more na, the way i see it, pagkukulang or needs improvement. i tried to help them, i suggested some ideas, and i also want to work with them, pero parang wala lang sakanila, tuloy lang sila sa mga ginagawa nila. hindi mo feel yung presence nila hangga't hindi sila kumakatok sa pinto mo. biruin mo mahigit kumulang 500k budget nila sa pa-liga (basketball) at sports development daw nung pre-covid times. wala ring regular meeting/sessions/assembly ang mga kk hahaha isa pang pagkukulang. hindi ko alam bakit nahalal sila bilang officials e, parang pogi points lang at porma. super daming kailangan ayusin at i-improve, para sa akin. i focused on the sk since i'm a member of the katipunan ng kabataan (kk), i'm still 19y/o, i want to make a change by starting here. ngayon lang ako nagising sa katotohanan na maraming pagkukulang sa sistema at kailangang baguhin or ayusin. i also believe that i have the capacity to fill the gaps in their shortcomings and i really wanted to serve our youth in the barangay. maybe i'll run for councilor or chairperson? i have no knowledge about how to run for office/position in sk, any tips, guides, stragies, advice? thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ndu73q/i_want_to_improve_and_change_our_barangay_by/,16 05 2021
Mga kaibigan na hindi na nagbayad ng utang,"sino dito yung, ilang beses na nakaexperience nang friends, minsan very close friends or relatives, na hindi ka na binalikan sa utang nila sayong pera? eto kasi naexperience ko, in the past few years, meron akong nakitang pattern or common na sasabihin nung mga taong umutang sakin. it's ""alam kong baka masira pagkakaibigan natin pero kinakapalan ko na mukha ko, promise babayaran ko next month"". pero after ilang buwan, hindi ka na chinat. alam ko commonly may mga pinagdadaanan sila pati na rin sa hirap ng buhay. kapag nagpapautang ako, of course if kaya ko lang ung amount, and ready ako mawala yun. and never ko sila nilapitan para singilin. i feel betrayed everytime hindi na sila magchachat sayo or iiwasan ka sa social media. gnun nalang ba ako kawalang halaga sa knila para sirain tiwala ko? kaya napaisip ako, ano kaya solution sa culture nating ganito? also kita ko sa social media yung iba sila pa yung galit pag hindi pinautang or kapag sisingilin mo. nag set ako ng rule. na no matter what happens, hindi nako magpapautang or kapag may magaattempt, sasabihin ko na agad na ""no sorry hindi nako nagpapautang kahit kanino, kahit sa pamilya, and it will be unfair sa mga taong hindi ko mapapautang, and ayoko masira friendship natin nang dahil dun."" any stories from you guys? what do tou think is the best way to fix the utang culture?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/16g5ddh/mga_kaibigan_na_hindi_na_nagbayad_ng_utang/,11 09 2023
"Fellow medical professionals, do you feel like your country and countrymen have forgotten about you?","i was talking with some of my friends earlier today who are fellow doctors and some nurses. some of them who work in covid wards and patients were talking about how they were thinking of possibly looking for a way to source either pfizer or moderna (when moderna gets eua) for their own personal protection due to their fear that sinovac will be the one primarily available in the country. the issue with that is that due to increased relative exposure of medical personnel to covid, a higher effectivity vaccine would be better. the chances of getting some outside official means looks slim, but they entertained the idea if push comes to shove. napaisip lang din ako. a friend of mine na doctor din but in another friend group recently got admitted din for covid. malamang nahawa sa isang patient nya. swerte siya na di masama condition nya and stable sya, non icu admission, pero naiisip ko na rin na with how vaccines are now supposedly available a lot of medical professionals would be more confident in doing their jobs if they could get a good vaccine. a lot of them would also be able to work and not themselves be a patient if they got vaccines earlier. ewan ko. it feels like nakalimutan na mga medical professionals ng bansa. i won't count myself super frontliner doctor because i don't see a lot of covid patients compared to most of my colleagues, pero sometimes it feels like no one cares about medics anymore. when you ask for more understanding na di mo pwede harapin certain patients kasi at risk exposure ka, babastusin ka ng patient. pag sinasabi mo gusto mo ng mas magandang vaccine kasi mas mataas viral exposure mo, sasabihan ka na choosy reklamador ka. pag gusto mo ng break at maka pahinga kahit konti, tatawagin kang tamad. pag hinahanap mo yung hazard pay and other risk benefits mo na wala pa, sasabihan ka na mag trabaho ka nalang at wag mag reklamo. tapos most of these come of mga kapwa taumbayan mo, not even from hospital administrative staff. ironically sila pa yung mas understanding and supportive, if you compare to how hospital admins in the news act in places like the states and eu.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ls3a3g/fellow_medical_professionals_do_you_feel_like/,25 02 2021
How did growing up in a toxic Pinoy family F you up as a person?,"warning: ed, verbal abuse, child abuse my grandparents are just as toxic as my parents. my mom and dad are a couple of spineless cowards. takot rin sila sa lolo't lola ko, kaya hindi nila kami ipinagtatanggol pag ""dinidisiplina"" kami. i am the first of three siblings and the only female. our family lived in our ancestral home because my mother was my lolo and lola's favorite daughter. growing up in the 90s, my lolo and lola always found food and mealtime as the best means to punish me with. at around four years old to 8, talagang may kahinaan ako kumain. my lolo would always be the one to serve me food. sa akin niya lang ito ginagawa. every time ang dami niyang ilalagay sa plato ko na combination of kanin mixed with whatever viand we're having na halos an inch a way na lang from the edge of the plate sa sobrang dami. as in, itsura pa lang, nalulunod na ako. he would sit across me from the dining table and watch me like a hawk during meal time. he would remind me ever so often to take a bite. ""putang ina. wag mo tungangaan yan. sumubo ka!"", ""wag mo susuhin 'yang pagkain mo! lulunin mo yan!"", ""ano? kakain ka, o isusubsob kita sa pagkain mo na parang aso?"" some nights, nagwawala siya pag di ako makalampas sa tatlong subo. may isang beses na pinagbabasag niya yung plato ko't baso habang nagsisisigaw. tumigil rin kumain yung buong pamilya kasi nalagyan ng mga bubog yung pagkain namin. i remember crying myself to sleep that night nang hindi na nakapaligo pa sa sobrang takot. whenever i cannot finish my meal which is almost every meal, every day, paparusahan ako. the parusa can range from having rights, privileges and my favorite things taken from me. from no tv especially on weekends, my fave books get taken away as well as my toys bawal ko rin hawakan at kalaruin yung aso namin kung di, papaluin ng lolo ko yung aso para pati daw yung alaga ko ""magtanda"". (anong kinalaman nung aso sa di ko pagkain? bakit siya dapat magtanda!?) sometimes my fave toy at the moment gets placed in the middle of the dining table and i only get to touch it if i finish my meal. since hindi ko nga kaya , i usually just bid these toys goodbye. (yung isa kong polly pocket, nakuha ko na at 12 ish years old. na-outgrow ko na siya.) so, to remedy this i worked on being able to eat. then, i gained weight around my pre-teens given the amount of rice i was supposed to finish daily, my lola started taking over out of the blue. all she did was bully me whenever we're eating. especially pag may ibang tao like if we have guests or we're eating out. she would yell things at me. stuff like :""non-stop talaga yang bunganga mong putang ina ka noh? kaya ka lumolobo eh."" one time my uncle winced and called her out when he heard her say ""anlaki-laki ng ng tiyan mo, panay saksak mo pa rin ng pagkain sa muka mong tang ina ka."" when we were out sa grocery, she woud shame me sa mga sales people and sa cashier telling them na. ""lahat 'yan para dito lang sa elepante ko."" or when i would pick an item for myself she would scream out loud for other shoppers to hear na: ""sige! lamon! ang galing galing mo talaga pag dating sa pagpili ng lalamunin mo!"" and she would do this angrily. hindi passive agressive. as in galit at pasigaw. kaya super nakakahiya. when she's in a subtle mood. she would mockingly immitate the way i chew and would laugh calling me: "" babuy!"" or would sarcastically comment on my appearance pag halimbawa naka-ayos ako ""ganda mo, para kang palanggana."" she would also deny me of food at times. say for example she buys a box of donuts, ako lang ang di pwede kumuha. and at times, would accuse me of stealing food or treats at home only to find out na ang kumuha ay either of my brothers. my brothers would deliberately shield me and even so. sasabihin niya na tinakot ko daw yu g mga kapatid ko kaya pinagtatakpan ako. because of this, my brothers learned na magpaalam even for just a handful of m&ms para wag nila ako makitang pinagtitripan ng lola ko. and because i was just so over this treatment, nag diet naman ako. hindi ko namalayan na sumosobra na pala. it didn't help na in the 2000s the pro-ana-mia movement was in full swing. and the media was advocating for thinnes overall. the fashions at the time also favored slim frames. sick as it may seem, i found refuge in bingeing and purging. nakakain ko lahat ng gusto ko without having to gain weight. i also felt that i looked great in the latest trends at that time. i got hospitalized in 2007 for contracting a fatal gastrointentional infection which almost took me out because i was too weak to fight it. violent stomach upsets ba naman at vomitting and diarrhea ang primary symptoms. i weighed only 85lbs at 5ft. 3"". if it weren't for this infection, i wouldn't have been diagnosed with bulimia. it took a nutritionist, our family gastroenteroligist and my first psychiatrist and a couple of female professors na parang mommy figure ko sa school to help get me back to a healthy 115 lbs. i tried to work hard with them to get my life back. pero sa bahay, everything i went through was treated as nothing more than a physiological issue. walang may gusto mag address nung trauma which caused it all. they say, that's my psych's job. yung mommy ko naman, sinasabi niya na hindi niya maalala yung mga kinuwento ko sa inyo dito kanina. but she was always there when this happened. my brothers remember it too! mas naiiyak ako rito pag naiisip ko keysa sa mga pinagsasasabi sa akin ng lolo at lola ko. like, how can mom not remember? yun ba ang trauma response niya? selective amnesia? dahil ba hindi niya kakayanin kung di lilimutin ng utak niya as a form of defense? idk, pero parang mas nasasaktan ako doon. i feel so betrayed. in my 20's i got myself a career one na super minahal ko, pero sucked the soul out of me kasi very competitive and demanding. that time, i got back into bingeing and stopped seeing my psychiatrist and nutritionist all together. kasi, ako na ang magbabayad sa kanila eh. that time though, hindi na ako nagpupurge. i buried myself in work and sweets. before i know it i was gaining weight again. each time i get stressed, i will take my anger and frustration out on a whole cake, a tub of ice cream or makikipag inuman ako pero ang chaser ko 1.5 na coke at sa akin lang yun. donuts held a special place in my heart. kada may magbubukas na bagong donut shop, you can expect to see me falling in line to get a box! i also had candy in my pockets too. all. the. time! expensive candy or cheap candy is just the same to me. basta candy. i remember my psych said that my obsession with it had something to do with candy being the instrument my lola used as a ""trap"" nung bata ako. now, i am just all too happy na i wouldn't get in trouble for being able to access it as an adult. it didn't come as a surprise sa akin na lumobo ako, this time 3x from when i first gained weight as a preteen. i am full-on obese. where was my lolo and lola? nasa bahay pa rin. so, what i did to avoid them was that i left for work early and leave very late at night. i would even just chill with my boyfriend on weekends wag lang ako matambay sa bahay. from then on, i just lived every day as an obese woman. lahat ng milestones ko in life, i achieved as a fat woman. hindi sa proud ako. that's just what i am. severely depressed and fat -- but somehow unstoppable ma-achieve ang work goals ko. then, i had a very bad, unexpected mental breakdown in 2013. kaya i decided to see a new psychiatrist. i was then diagnosed with ptsd and my chronic depression was due to a hormonal imbalance pala. i got treated for the depression and ptsd. pero hirap ako maging physiologically healthy through food. no matter how much media i consume about living and eating healthy i can't seem to get it right. in 2017, i had a major fight with my lolo and finally ibinulalas ko na lahat ng hinanakit ko. pinagmumumura ko siya, at sinabihan rin ng masasakit na salita. i almost physically assaulted him, pero napigilan ako ng kapatid ko. he knew na siguradong mapapahamak ako if i were to lay a hand on my dirtbag of a lolo. jut imagine my obese ass hitting an 80 year old man. i knew that was the end of my stay at that house. lumayas ako nang walang pagdadalawang-isip and lived with my boyfriend just a month before our wedding. my brother helped me pack at siya ang naghatid sa akin. i never returned home. (my brothers were also theorizing na my lolo deliberately planned on riling me up para mag clash kami because i was about to have a big life event and he just felt like pissing on it. just like how all of a sudden, bigla siyang nagwala bago yung debut ko dati. one of my brothers also thought that kaya sa akin pinaka galit yung grandparents namin ay dahil daw, naging kaagaw nila ako sa attention ng mommy ko / anak nila mula nang ipanganak ako. yun ang sabi nila. ako? ewan ko! talagang hindi ko na lang siya kaya pagtimpian. all i feel is rage and contempt.) i saw my lolo again during my lola's funeral. she died 5 months after ko maglayas. namatay siya nang di kami nag uusap at galit ako sa kanya. when i heard the news i was the only one who had a hard time weeping for her. ff to now? i am living life in my mid 30s with maintenance meds for hypertension, borderline diabetis and chronic depression. but, there is a silver lining. i married a kind, understanding and gentle husband na hindi ako nagsasawang paalalahanan na walang parusa na naka abang sa akin pag hindi ko naubos ang pagkain ko. at, hindi ko na kailangan kainin ang feelings ko, dahil nandito siya para pakinggan ako nang walang paghuhusga. i have had so many doctors try to help me, but i believe that it is only he who is actually healing my inner child little by litte.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/10ijk65/how_did_growing_up_in_a_toxic_pinoy_family_f_you/,22 01 2023

"" 6. duterte on loving his country and his take on human rights: "" kaya ang totoo diyan human rights, kayo ang dapat tapusin. because you’d --- you… kayo you love your country whatever country you come from. from --- you have a country that’s a s\*\*\*. me, i love my country and i love my -- - ‘yung mga bata pa. "" 7. on ejk: "" ako sinabi ko sa mga pulis, “’pag masabit kayo diyan sa trabaho ninyo, ako ‘yun. ituro mo, “si duterte ‘yon sir ang nagturo sa amin.” and i will protect you. ‘yung may kaso ngayon, hindi ko tinulungan pero… anyway, abugado \[garbled\]. gigranada --- gigranada niya ‘yung selda. sampung --- dalawang granada, patay lahat. so murder. sige lang. ano ka lang. huwag ka mag-alala. hanggang life imprisonment ka lang. “sir…” o sige. finally last week, he --- everybody was acquitted. ganun ako magtulong. hindi ako sinasabi na binibili ko. hindi --- hindi ko sabi ko lang pinapakiusapan ko ang judge. hindi ko rin pinapakiusapan ang pulis kay may --- i… bantay rin kayo diyan sa ano ninyo. malaman ninyo ‘yan eh.

SOGIE Time (English Terms),"hi po! random post po! i just want to share my knowledge about sogie dahil pride month po ngayon. sexual orientation, gender identity, and expression ito po ang laging napaghahalo ng mga tao = sex, gender, at sexual orientation assigned sex = ito po ang sex natin sa birth certificate na siyang kinumpirma ng mga duktor noong tayo'y nailuwal. afab (assigned female at birth) at amab (assigned male at birth) po ang dalawang nabibilang sa assigned sex. male at female po sa madaling salita intersex = pambihirang pangyayari kung saan hindi maiuri ang isang tao sa gender binary (lalaki ba o babae?) dahil ang pangangatawan and/or ang sex chromosomes ng naturang tao ay alanganin at maselan. (underdeveloped genitalia, coexistence of male and female sex organs in a human body, abnormal sex chromomes) bakit wala po sa mga birth certificate/legal and medical documents ang intersex na category??? dahil hindi ito gaanong documented at hindi nare-recognize ng maraming tao due to its rarity. it is so rare that not everyone knows about them because intersex people choose to conform to the gender binary to avoid attracting negative attention. please watch that one video in jessica soho about a man that menstruates. he is practically an intersex, but he identifies and was identified as a man because his phenotype (outward appearance) presents as that of a typical biological male. gender = a social construct that simplifies and categorizes the norms that people should follow or conform onto according to their assigned sex. dahil po rito, nakikilala po natin kung ang isang tao ba ay lalaki o babae sa unang sulyap natin sa kanilang bihis, kilos, at panlabas na anyo. gender binary = male/female identity = cisgender,/cissexual, transgender/transsexual, or non-binary cisgender = people that are afab or amab that matches with their gender identity. (afab na nag-a-identify as female at amab na nag-a-identify as male). another term for this is cissexual (focusing on the biological aspect of the person rather than their gender identity) transgender = people who identify on a gender that does not match their assigned sex. maaaring sila ay operado (sex reassignment surgery) o hindi operado (without surgery). maaaring sila ay umiinom ng hrt (hormone replacement therapy) pills o hindi. kapag ang isang tao ay nagpabago na ng kaniyang anatomy and physiology, transsexuals na sila... though transgender is still the umbrella term. what about legal documents? sa pilipinas, ipinagbabawal po ang pagpapalit ng pangkapanganakang kasarian natin (sad news for trans people) kahit na ikaw ay nagpa-sex change na. bagkus, pinapayagan ito under medical conditions (nagkamali ang doctor ng assignment sa sex mo, nagkaroon ka ng issues sa pagbibinata/pagdadalaga mo due to possession of intersexual traits.). and this is also debatable on court. non-binary = spectrum ng mga taong ayaw magpatawag na fully lalaki o babae. maaaring nag-aalangan sila sa kanilang identity o dili kaya ay mga intersex individuals who live up to their intersexuality. maaari ring nagrerefer ito sa mga taong nasa spectrum ng pagiging cisgender-transgender (kinikilala ba nila ang pagiging _________ nila from birth as their gender or gusto nilang sumakabilang kasarian? enby people belong between these two ends of the spectrum) sexual orientation: 2 types. sexual or asexual? kapag asexual ka, wala kang gusto. kapag sexual ka naman, nagkakagusto ka. sexual subtypes: heterosexual (straight), homosexual (same-gender-attraction) , bisexual (same-gender at different gender/s from yours ay attracted ka), at marami pa pong iba. transexuality is not a sexual orientation, sexual identity po siya. summary: sex: male (or amab), female (or afab), intersex (it varies from case to case) identities: cis, trans, nb gender: man/boy/lad/lalaki, woman/girl/lady/babae, nb sexual orientation: asexual, sexual (straight and the non-straight categories). at the end of this long post, i just want to say na matuto tayong gumalang sa pagkakakilanlan at pag-ibig ng ating kapuwa dahil may mga kaniya-kaniya tayong mga pinagdaanan sa buhay na siyang humubog sa pagkatao natin ngayon. ilayo natin ang usapang panrelihiyon dahil walang nakaaalam kung ano ba ang tunay na pananampalataya o hindi. subali't, ang taong iyong nakahahalubilo ay totoong-totoo, at bilang isang tao, ayon sa konstitusyon, likas sa atin ang karapatang igalang ng ating kapuwa sa kung sinuman tayo. ultimo ang kriminal nga ay iginagalang eh. ano pa kaya ang inosenteng lgbtq+ na kapuwa nating ipinagsasakdal sa kaniyang pag-ibig? nakasakit ba siya ng kapuwa sa pagiging totoo niya sa kaniyang sarili? nakapapatay ba ng tao ang pagiging bakla? mapanira ba ito sa kalikasan, kabuhayan, at kalusugan ng ibang tao? hindi!!! kasalanan ba ang pagiging bakla? aywan ko sa inyo. pinalaki akong atheist eh hahahahaha ano ba ang sabi ng diyos ninyo? anyways, respeto na lang sa paniniwala ninyo i guess. but what is not respectable is the violence towards the lgbtq+ community. if you participate, promulgate, and/or enable this, you are not worthy of my attention. i may respect you but i cannot tolerate you. unless you choose to change for the better, you deserve whatever criticism you will consequently receive for your close-mindedness. we have to remember na huwag tayong pa-special sa mundong ito. 8 billion ang mga tao, at iisa ka lang. the only constant moral standard in this world is to be makatao. put yourselves in the shoes of others you are trying to judge. do they deserve it? if it were you, do you deserve it? alang sa lahat ng mga baklang (bakla = lgbtq+ community) nagmahal, nakibaka, nabigo, napatay, napatahimik, at napagkaitan ng kanilang kaligayahan at kalayaang maging sila, ipinagbubunyi ko kayo sa pamamagitan ng pagdiriwang ng pride month na ito. bilang kabahagi ng mga lgbtq+, patuloy kong ipaglalaban ang karapatan ng bawat tao (opo, pati ang mga straight.) sa kanilang sogie hanggang makamtan natin ang mga karapatang magpoprotekta at kikilala sa atin bilang mga pilipinong nagmamahal at may karapatang magmahal sa sinumang nais nilang sintahin. simulan po natin sa pagpuna sa mga taong mapanakit sa mga lgbtq+ sa kanilang kilos at pananalita hanggang sa pagboto sa mga pulitikong magsusulong ng mga karapatang pantao ng mga pilipino. sa mga makababasa po nito. maraming salamat po sa inyong pagtitiyaga at malawakang pag-unawa! 🌈happy pride month po sa ating lahat🌈",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/v8njcj/sogie_time_english_terms/,9 06 2022

"We lost contact with our mom, who works as an overseas Filipino worker in Riyadh","tl;dr: we have not heard anything from our mom for four days and we are worried about her safety. i reached out to her agency but there’s no update yet about her situation there. hello , i am the oldest son and just wanted to get this off my chest. i am currently a 3rd yr student and masyado akong na-busy last week gawa't midterms namin yon. last tuesday, napansin ko na hindi na tumatawag or nagchachat si mama at nakita ko na hindi siya talaga nag o-online. nagtaka na ko at sinubukan kong siyang i-message pero walang reply. ang last convo namin at last activity niya sa fb niya ay nung saturday pa. nag sabi na ko sa so ko at sabi niya we'll call owwa tom if wala pa rin response si mama that day. kinabuksan, tinawagan ko na ang owwa at binigay naman ang cellphone number ng agency ni mama para matawagan at i-raise ang concern. tinawagan ko pero walang sumasagot so nag iwan lang ako ng message. later that night, nag reply naman at sinabing ipapaabot daw nila sa foreign recruitment agency (fra). kinabukasan (today), nag send na ng message ang agency ni mama sa fra this morning at nag reply naman ang fra na they will check with the employer at babalikan daw ang agency kapag may update na. we were all so worried na to the point na si tita, nataranta na at tinawagan ang agency, baka raw inaway na ni tita ang nakausap niya sa agency at binantaan na ipapa tulfo daw (naiintindihan ko naman si tita kay usually ganon talaga mga kilala kong boomers) sabi ni ate na pinsan ko. now, super grateful ako kay so na nagagawa niya kong pakalmahin kahit napaka overthinker ko. we will pray for mama's safety there in riyadh. if may mga kakilala kayo sa fra o nasa riyadh (near alyasmi ), please baka matulungan niyo ko sa concern namin. i forgot, nung last vc namin ni mama ay nabanggit niya na minsan nahahampas niya na ang cp niya kasi raw naglalag gawa nang mabagal ang internet. hindi naman nananakit ang amo niya, mabait naman daw pero sinasabi niyang kuripot kay tinitipid daw siya sa food. so, i assumed na nasira ang phone ni mama kaya hindi namin siya ma-contact. i tried locating her phone through google's 'find my device' app, but i can't locate her. di naman nag ooff si mama ng gps niya sa phone kasi chinecheck ko yan siya before sa app na yan. ang concern ko lang ay baka ma-depress si mama ng todo kasi palagi siya nag rarant sa amin everyday sa tuwing tumatawag siya na nababagot na daw siya doon kasi wala siyang makausap. palagi niya kaming tinatawagan para hindi siya ma-bored doon, kahit na choppy siya. i will be celebrating my bday this month and my only wish is for her to be safe palagi sa saudi. debut ko na this yr at gusto ko sana kasama ko buong family ko mag celebrate pero nasa malayo si mama. pero kahit sana maka-vc man lang namin siya. i hope she's okay. i really miss her. take ko na rin tong opportunity to ask if totoo ba na hindi usually nasusunod ang kontrata ng mga ofw (in middle east, particularly, saudi), lalo na sa day off? update: a friend of my cousin's friend contacted my mother's employer and hung up when she uttered my mother's name. update (2): i want to express my heartfelt gratitude po for the overwhelming support and concern many of you shared in response to this post. i'm relieved to update you all na we've heard from my mom na, and she's safe, thank god! it turns out her employer's internet service was temporarily disconnected, and they estimate it could take up to 2 weeks to resolve. ito po yung reason bakit hindi siya nakapag-contact sa amin. wala po siyang sim card ng saudi and she doesn't have mobile data. di rin po siya basta pina-connect ng amo niya sa data nila. luckily, maybe after ma-raise ang concerns sa iba't-ibang agencies particularly sa fra ng mom ko na ilang beses tinawagan yung employer, her employer finally allowed her brief access to their data po, allowing her to contact us and provide reassurance. it was a very tough time for our entire family. i can't imagine if anything bad happens sa mom ko. thank you all for your support and kind words. it means the world to us, and we're now in a much better state knowing my mom is okay. appreciate you all po! lahat ng comments niyo binasa ko at sobrang laking tulong ng mga suggestions ninyo, and most importantly, ng mga prayers ninyong lahat 🙏 lesson learned: ngayon ko na-realize na ibang-iba talaga ang culture sa saudi. reality hits hard. di ko inexpect na pati sa mobile data ay kayang ipagdamot ng employer ng mama ko. tho i still believe na hindi naman lahat ng stereotype patungkol sa mga arabs ay totoo and cultural diversity plays a role in this. despite our struggles, i'm still very much grateful that my mom is safe and sound.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/18cr8a4/we_lost_contact_with_our_mom_who_works_as_an/,7 12 2023

Creatures of Philippine Lower Mythology,"reading this book it details the physical attributes, magic and power, capabilities and domiciles of philippine lower mythological beings like demons (kapre, tikbalang) aswangs, witches, mermaids and engkantos. the book taps the history of pre-colonial philippines. the book also explore the comprehensive effects of these creatures in the daily life of filipinos. positive man or negative. while some filipinos believe in the existence of these creatures, some may not. i personally believe that science should triumph over superstitious or primitive beliefs. that everything has a logical explanations be it sa pagkalampag ng bubong (dahil dinapuan ng aswang ang bubong) or itim na aso na umaaligid sa bahay ng may sakit. however, nakakaaliw din magbasa or makinig ng mga stories tungkol sa aswang, mangkukulam, engkanto, tikbalang and etc. so bilang malapit na ang halloween at bilang batang pinanganak ng early 90s na part ng school life yung pinagkwekwentuhan ang mga kwentong kakatakutan kapag ganitong buwan…drop your stories here (narinig man or naexperience) about these creatures of the night.",https://i.redd.it/15237my7qysb1.jpg,8 10 2023
Is it just me?

"Salamat, BBM!","kilala ako ng mga malapit sa akin at pamilya ko bilang isang tao na sobrang negative ang outlook sa buhay - palagi ko sinasabi na failure ako, wala pang nararating, walang maipagmamalaki, at walang maifle-flex sa kung kanino man. may mga point nga na sobrang down ko sa buhay at wala akong magawa kundi mag-rant sa mga kapamilya at kaibigan ko. tapos, nalaman ko yung tungkol kay bbm. di pala to naka-graduate ng kolehiyo - basically, unemployed tambay lang, at kaya lang may pera dahil galing sa luhho ng pamilya. walang ginawa sa buhay kundi mag-ml at magka-covid twice nung peak ng pandemic. at speaking of pamilya, ayun lang ang tanging maipagmamalaki niya at wala nang iba. na kaya lang siya nanalong presidente, ay dahil sa napakalaking propaganda machine na buma-back-up sakanya. that's when i realize, na kahit ordinaryong mamamayang pilipino lang ako, ay mas lamang pa pala ako sakanya. kahit na-delay, gumraduate nga pala ako ng kolehiyo. may trabaho, at kumikita nang marangal. mas malakas pa ang resistensya dahil siklista ako at kayang pumadyak nang malayo. may talento sa musika at pag-awit. may paninindigan, at may plano sa buhay. nung nalaman ko yun, hindi na ako nagkaroon ng depressive episodes at feelings of hitting the rock bottom. mas bumilib at tumaas na rin ang tingin ko sa sarili ko. so kumbaga, salamat bbm! dahil ngayon, kahit papano, i feel better and confident for myself - dahil nalaman kong mas angat, at mas may mga maipagmamalaki pa pala ako kesa sayo. **tl;dr:** i would like to thank bbm for making me realize that i actually have things, milestones, and achievements that i can truly be proud of, due to his lack thereof.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/wnqtlf/salamat_bbm/,13 08 2022
"Naniniwala ba kayo sa mga maligno, engkanto, kaluluwa, atbp.","i had this experience recently. around 9 pm na ako nakarating mula sa amin sa cubao to our subdivision kung saan ako nagboboarding sa san jose city, nueva ecija ,(doon kasi ako nag-aaral sa clsu) then sa isang street may isang bahay na tinatayo pa lang na sobrang madilim dahil walang ilaw. as i passed the house, may narinig ako na umiiyak, in-ignore ko lang kasi baka nga may sanggol talaga doon. after few meters, may puno at grassy part, iba naman ang naririnig ko, tumatawa naman. medyo creepy at tumindig talaga ang balahibo ko. tapos pag dating ko sa boarding, wala yung caretaker sa kabila at yung ilaw sa cr ay patay-sindi. then after few days umuwi na ako samin sa qc. sa 5th floor kami nakatira, sumakay ako sa elevator, mag-isa lang ako. pinindot ko ang number 5. after few seconds, umilaw ang 4. hindi ko naman pinindot. nang tumapat na sa 4th floor, bumakas ang elevator pero walang pumasok, pero may narinig ako na tumatawa. inignore ko na lang. baka kako may batang nagpindot sa labas ng floor. pero imposible e. sa loob umilaw. then nito lang ay nagkasakit ako, ilang araw din na masama ang pakiramdam ko. nagbakasakali ako na baka connected to sa experience ko nung nakaraan. ilang beses na rin kasi ako nagkasakit dahil mga ""hindi nakikita"" na yan. since bata pa ako madalas may ganyan nang karanasan. sabi ko sa nanay ko na ipatawas ako (nasa laguna siya). ayon sa tawas, may babaeng kaluluwa daw na nagkakagusto sa akin. sa puno nakatira. lagi raw nakasunod sa akin at inaadvise-an ako nung nagtawas na magsuot palagi ng pula. nakita rin niya sa tawas na nakadagan sakin yung multo. sobrang creepy talaga. may isa rin akong nakilala na student na doon din nagdodorm sa subdivision na yon. lalaking maligno naman ang nagkakagusto sa kanya. ilang araw din nagkasakit yon. i know na hindi para sa lahat ang story na to. kahit ako dati e. di naman naniniwala. di naman pwedeng mamilit. hehe sa mga naniniwala. may mga similar experiences ba kayo?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ypbv38/naniniwala_ba_kayo_sa_mga_maligno_engkanto/,8 11 2022

&nbsp; paglilinaw: ang hindrance sa ating progress na humihila sa'tin pababa ay hindi ang criticism o pagpuna sa'ting government officials, kundi ang ating intolerance at galit sa criticism. maganda ang sinabi sa [article na ito](https://www.manilatimes.net/2020/03/19/opinion/columnists/topanalysis/criticizing-as-a-form-of-civic-duty/704176). habang hindi naman tayo gumagawa ng threats o nagdudulot ng harm sa'ting kapuwa, walang masama sa pag-express ng frustrations o konting humor sa mga mali sa ating lipunan at gobyerno. mas ok pa rin yung aware tayo kesa magpikit mata tayo na parang mas mahal na natin ang isang public servant kaysa sa bayan. balansihin din natin. hindi ito pagrebelde o pakikipaglaban sa gobyerno, kundi pag-call out ng inefficiencies at incompetence, at pagsuporta na rin sa checks and balances ng ating lipunan para hindi maabuso ang kapangyarihan. at hindi komo nagrereklamo, hindi ibig sabihin wala tayong ibang ginagawa. si leni nga andaming reklamo ng lugaw na yan, pero halos araw-araw ring nagtrabaho simula day 1. ang gusto lang namin kay leni, kahit kailan hindi siya pagalit mag-voice out ng criticism at malumanay siyang nagbibigay ng suggestions for improvement. kaya marami rin ang akala ay mahina at walang political will si leni kasi malumanay siya. pero hindi siya mahina kundi matapang. isipin mo, presidente na mismo ang pinupuna niya, kahit alam niya ang negative effect sa image at popularity niya dahil alam naman niya ang kultura nating mga pinoy na napaka-allergic sa criticism. kita naman natin ang backlash sa facebook posts niya na flooded ng laugh reacts at toxic comments. pero bakit ba talaga si leni nagvo-voice out? ramdam niya ang mga hinanakit ng taong bayan kasi andun siya mismo parati sa ground at may kamalayan siya sa kalagayan ng mga tao. like yung pag-una pa sa dolomite sand, sabi niya ito raw ay [insensitive](https://mb.com.ph/2020/09/08/manila-bay-white-beach-an-insensitive-plan-in-time-of-pandemic-solon/) kasi magbuhos sana dapat muna ng lahat ng resources at attention sa pandemic, which is a valid point 'di ba? dahil alam niyang kapag mas mabilis maka-return to normal ang labor force natin, mas mabilis aangat muli ang ekonomiya natin. &nbsp; ##2. puppet si leni ng oligarchs! &nbsp; paglilinaw: unlike sa panahon ni cory na may injustices laban sa mga magsasaka, kahit bago pa si leni tumakbo for any public office, no political plans or agenda, bilang lawyer ay mahusay niyang ipinagtanggol na pro bono (walang bayad) ang maraming marginalized sectors. halimbawa ay ang paglaban niya para sa mga lupa ng sumilao farmers against sa conglomerate by the name of san miguel corporation. naipanalo nila ang kaso laban sa mga elite. kaya hindi nakakapagtaka kung bakit todo ang suporta sa kaniya ng mga [sumilao farmers](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/779322/sumilao-farmers-to-march-not-for-land-but-for-robredo). iba iba rin ang ugali ng individual na members ng mga partido, hindi lahat masama o lahat mabuti. halimbawa, sina cory at duterte ay parehas na kabilang sa pdp-laban, na sinimulan naman ni ninoy. kakapalit lang din ni sara recently. makikita rin natin sa saln ni leni na hindi siya kasing yaman ng most politicians, kaya noong sinampahan siya ng kaso ni bbm, may volunteers na nagbuo ng [crowdfunding campaign](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/803171/piso-para-kay-leni) to support her legal fees. anong ginawa niya? at her own personal risk, she politely declined to avoid graft at ipinamahagi lahat ng funds sa angat buhay program, especially sa housing projects sa marawi. see [here](https://gogetfunding.com/piso-para-sa-laban-ni-leni/) for more details. also search for ""jeanette concepcion patindol piso para kay leni"" on facebook. this speaks volumes about her integrity. isa pa, her office consistently received the highest audit rating from coa for [3 straight years](https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2021/6/29/ovp-highest-audit-rating-coa-third-straight-year-.html). ilang beses na tayong umasa sa mga napakagandang pangako ng mga politiko, so it might help if i-apply natin ito sa **lahat** ng ating candidates: kahit gaano kaganda ang mga pangako, plano, at plataporma ng kahit sinong candidate, kahit gaano kagaling siyang magsalita, ka-inspiring ang kaniyang vision, at katindi ng kaniyang political will, ang mas reliable indicator ng kanilang totoong character ay hindi ang kanilang words, hindi rin ang words para sa kanila ng naging allies nila or ng sikat na vloggers or influencers, kundi ang kanilang **past actions**. she takes quick actions. at ang lahat ng ginawa niya bilang vp ay **initiatives** lang niya o kusang loob—hindi part ng mandates ng ovp—dahil siya ay isang servant leader. &nbsp; ##3. history is written by the victors! &nbsp; *""napakarami namang infrastructures ang ginawa noon. binenta ng mga dilawan ang mga pagmamayari ng bayan!""* paglilinaw: ang ""history is written by the victors"" and ""corrupt naman lahat, at least may nagawa"" ay tinatawag na fallacious generalizations o mga logical fallacy dahil sa insufficient evidence at overreliance on observations o panlabas na nakikita. kailangan natin makita ang bigger picture para malinawan tayo. graduate ako ng economics sa up kaya kahit nasa 30s na ako at nakalimutan ko na most of my lectures on development economics, kahit papaano ay may kamalayan pa rin ako at paggamit ng critical thinking para ma-separate kung ano ang propaganda at hindi, at kung ano ang nangyari sa ekonomiya natin. oo, napakaraming ginawang infrastructures. walang mali dito kung careful at proper ang pag-spend. ang problema ay maraming cases ng overspending dahil sa cronies at mga rushed projects. read more [here](https://newslab.philstar.com/31-years-of-amnesia/building-spree). meron namang magagandang projects gaya ng san juanico bridge, philippine heart center, lung center of the philippines, dams, at napakarami pang iba. 2 dekada ba naman e. kaya lang napakalaking spending din sa failed investments gaya ng controversial bataan nuclear power plant na ang cost sana sa contract ay $0.65 billion pero biglang naging $2.2 billion. read [here](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2017/ph241/camacho2/). ang malala pa ay ang napakalaking ginastos din sa tinatawag na edifices para magmukhang may progress pero in the long run ay hindi masyadong nakatulong sa ating economic growth gaya ng ccp at manila film center. ang problema, ito ay debt-driven o puro galing sa utang sa world bank. mula around $0.6 billion utang bago maluklok si marcos, naging $26.7b pagkatapos. read [here](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/774774/well-pay-marcos-debt-until-2025). paano natin malalaman kung **overall** ay maganda ang investments natin sa infrastructure? ito ay kung lumago nga ang ating economy. matapos ang 2 dekadang pamumuno niya, anong nangyari sa economy natin? do marcos apologists give you any economic data, kahit ano gaya ng yearly gdp growth rate, o sinasabi lang nila na ""naramdaman at nakita"" nila ang progress at prosperity noon? oo, maganda naman talaga ang simula, pero tignan natin ang long-term effects. tinatawag nila itong ""golden age"" kahit nag-collapse ang economy natin sa early 1980s dahil hindi na tayo makabayad ng utang sa world bank at nagka-recession during his term. see [this image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ekhz98nz5fx8pzqe8306y7-csjhawppy/view) (verifiable at the psa website) sa gdp growth rate ng economy natin under marcos and a more detailed analysis [here](https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/money/content/172779/martial-law-costly-lessons-in-economic-development/story/). ang problema kasi, pinagbabasihan lang nila ang mga nakita nila at own experiences lang. oo, maganda at payapa ang buhay nila, pero hindi nila nire-represent ang buong bansa. bagsak ang economy leading to massive **inflation**, tapos isisisi nila lahat sa next admins. sobrang negative din ng tingin ng marami sa privatization o pagbenta ng government firms kaya isisisi nila lahat sa aquinos, pero may times na mas efficient pa mag-manage ng business ang private sector, kasi nag-invest sila mismo, kumpira sa government na may inefficiencies and red tape. halimbawa, ang bangui windmill farm ay owned and managed by a private corporation. hindi ako dilawan dahil wala naman talagang perfect na adminstration—may injustices din under the aquinos—pero sana aware tayo na iniwan ni marcos na sobrang lubog ang bansa sa utang or [high debt-to-gdp ratio](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gbnetxycvytwzr2_sd_7jod2qdv7klda/view?usp=drivesdk) at bagsak ang ekonomiya. ang privatization ay kahit papaano nakatulong ma-manage ang ating utang. sana wag magbase lang sa outward appearances or facades of progress. tignan natin ang mas malawak na konteksto kung bakit talagang napag-iwanan tayo. at kahit gaano kagaling ang isang leader (kahit pa may photographic memory siya), kagaling siyang magsalita, ka-inspiring ang kaniyang vision, o katindi ng kaniyang political will, ito ang hard lesson sa atin: competence is important but not as important as character. &nbsp; ##4. puro charity lang yan si leni! band-aid solution. di yan para sa long-term progress ng bansa natin! &nbsp; paglilinaw: hindi naman dahil nag-take siya ng initiatives na tumulong ay ibig sabihin noon ay wala siyang kamalayan sa long-term na makakatulong sa economic growth. hindi vp ang nagco-control ng spending natin sa infrastructure. pero graduate si leni ng economics sa up diliman. alam niya ang kahalagahan ng infrastructure kaya itutuloy niya ang [build, build, build](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2021/10/29/2137559/robredo-says-continue-anti-drug-campaign-build-build-build-tweaks?fbclid=iwar12u_l5gubhl7f35bzxzqyu3esc2t965enw7pwpvyxzyhdzq_zfjhiff6s) pero makikinig din siya sa ating best civil engineers para ma-address for example ang ating traffic and congestion sa urban areas. nakita rin natin ang kaniyang efficient management of resources at [achievements](https://www.reddit.com/r/leni2022/comments/qkl0wk/megathread_achievements_and_statements_of_maria/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) as vp kahit relatively maliit ang budget na inilaan sa ovp. at makikinig din siya sa mga experts and our best economists. ang kaibahan sa kaniya, mas confident tayo na hindi niya nanakawan ang kaban ng bayan. alam din natin na maglalagay siya ng professional leaders na nararapat sa bawat department, hindi yung nilagay lang dahil sa pabor o para ma-enforce ang kapangyarihan. &nbsp; ##5. bayaran ang media! &nbsp; paglilinaw: oo, hindi perfect ang media, pero unlike most vloggers na clearly biased, ang media ay much more under threat na mahabla o maaaring makulong kung lumabag ito sa batas. let me illustrate: in case lang naman na sobra kang amazed o hanga kay bbm for ""his"" bangui windmill farm, let's get the facts right. oo, ina-acknowledge natin na he eagerly permitted, facilitated, and inaugurated its construction according to [this opinion piece](https://manilastandard.net/mobile/article/367795). similar to his parents, alam niya kung gaano kalakas ng hatak ng votes ng sights of [big infrastructures](https://opinion.inquirer.net/145027/our-infrastructure-fetish). gamit na gamit nga sa campaign niya halos lahat ng videos ay may kasamang windmill animation. pero tandaan din na ito ay initiated, constructed, and financed not by the government but by the **private sector**. for complete details, see [here](https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=assvkrokksyc&pg=pa83&hl=en&sa=x&ved=2ahukewjdv8ywinvzahuugkykhfugabcq6af6baggeai#v=onepage&q&f=false). pag binasa natin 'yon, si **ferdinand dumlao** ang isa sa nag-initiate ng bangui windmill farm. ngayon itong si **thinking pinoy** inaakusahan niya na mali mag fact-check si rappler. ang claim kasi ni tp ay yung bangui windmill farm ay initiated by bbm dahil si dumlao daw kasi ang ""ilocos norte's provincial special projects manager"" ni bbm. watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bghpacxoxh4&t=14m00s&feature=youtu.be) at the 14:00 mark. pero magkaibang dumlao kasi 'yon. ang under ni bbm ay **hindi** si ferdinand dumlao kundi si **chito** dumlao. read [here](https://www.manilatimes.net/2004/11/23/news/regions/bongbong-furious-at-ilocos-norte-killing-spree/683199). at ang daming naloloko. tandaan, **hindi** reliable source ang napakaraming facebook, youtube, and tiktok videos dahil punong puno ito ng propaganda, ilang taon na. wala sila madalas na reference na binibigay, puro accusation at stories. at kung may reference gaya ni thinking pinoy, mina-manipulate nila to fit their narratives. hindi naman masyadong mahirap pag-isipan kung saan nanggaling ang makinarya ng propaganda. tsaka yung iba rin ay nare-reinforce nalang ng positive feedback ng community nila at ng [dunning kruger effect](https://www.britannica.com/science/dunning-kruger-effect#:~:text=dunning%2dkruger%20effect%2c%20in%20psychology,or%20of%20people%20in%20general). tapos magke-claim ang mga apologist na bayaran ang rappler at abs-cbn na nag-report din naman sa katiwalian under the aquinos at previous admins gaya ng sa mendiola—see this [report by rappler](https://www.rappler.com/nation/mendiola-massacre-anniversary-same-injustices). *hmm... sino kayang candidate na kabaliktaran ni cory at [ipinagtanggol](https://www.manilatimes.net/2016/04/13/news/top-stories/sumilao-farmers-choose-leni/255921) ang mga farmers at mga mahihirap laban sa mga elite?* since they cannot attack the evidence, their tactic is to target the sources (media) at siraan sila. kaya wag naman tayo masyado padala sa mga sikat na influencers gaya ni ka tunying, yung inc na vlogger. ok sana kung mag-cite siya ng sources, kaya lang kadalasan ay chismis style lang. pero mabait naman siya, misinformed nga lang din at feel niya pinagtutulungan siya kaya para sa kaniya, masama tayong lahat. valid naman ang point niya, wag dapat ipairal ang galit. &nbsp; ##edit: i had an idea. what if ang volunteer animators natin ay bumuo ng inspiring video animation, na may nagna-narrate using this explanation? kahit yung 1st, 2nd, at 4th misconceptions lang. para pati yung mga tinatamad magbasa ay ma-enlighten. baka may ma-contact kayo. yung with inspiring music gaya ng kay william capistrano et al. tapos gawing ad. suggestion lang naman. 🙂 &nbsp; **sa counterarguments:** feel free to comment your criticisms and counterarguments. please include suggestions so we can engage in civil discourse at ma-edit and improve pa natin itong mga paglilinaw. &nbsp; **sa gustong mag-contribute ng sarili nilang paglilinaw sa comments:** use this format. *misconception:* *paglilinaw:* &nbsp; **sa mga bukas ang mata:** alam nating she is facing an uphill battle for our nation. kaya nananawagan ako na habang may oras pa, tumindig tayo at humakbang para sa bayan. sa kabila ng takot, sa gitna ng magulong politika at malakas na ingay ng propaganda, let us amplify [the voice of reason](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/mobile/folders/19vdfrfqgfboq0kwqcdiuqydtn_dsoaal?usp=drive_fs) at ating patunayan ang ating malasakit sa bayan.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/qx82zk/replying_to_misinformation_against_leni/,19 11 2021

Tagalized Story.,"may story ako. ako lang ang nag-iisang babae sa pinag-tatrabahuhan kong kumpanya at alam ko na kung bakit. isa akong fresh graduate sa kolehiyo at gusto ko na talagang makapag-simula ng career agad-agad na walang kinalaman sa pagse-serve ng pagkain, pagpupunas ng mga gamit, o pag-dadala o timpla ng kape sa isang matandang negosyante. sa naka-sanayan nag-aapply ako sa trabaho na may anim na araw na trabaho at marami-rami na rin akong interview na napagdaanan. alam ko na ang tinapos kong hrm na kurso ay hindi gaanong makaka-kuha ng magandang oportunidad, pero naniniwala pa rin ako na may mas maganda pang trabaho na naghihintay sa akin. kaya naman nanatili akong positibo, matyaga, at nag-aapply lang sa mga office jobs na may magandang benipisyo. kahit halos wala na akong mapag-kunan ng makakain dahil sa magastos na mga interview, at least mapapag-tibay naman nito ang kakaunting pride na natitira sa akin. halos tatlong linggo na rin ang nakalipas, may isa akong phone interview sa isang internet security company. ang kumpanyang iyon ay maraming offices sa amin at naghahanap sila ng bagong customer support specialist para sa kanilang international department. ang mga requirements ay maganda o mahinahon na boses, good spoken and written grammar, kakaunting tech-knowledge, at may kakayahang mag-trabaho sa umaga at gabi. ang office ay dalawang sakay lang sa mula sa amin, at mayroon silang magandang offer sa health insurance. nag-aapply ako kahit lmitado lang din ang alam ko sa computer science. naging maayos naman ang phone interview at matapos ang dalawang meetings sa hr at sa management, binigyan nila ako ng isang napaka-gandang offer (kahit na wala pa talaga akong experience sa kahit anong trabaho). sa loob ng unang linggo ko, kailangan kong magtrabaho nang regular shift na 9-5 (am) para maging online ako kasabay ng manager ko, na nag-trabaho sa ibang branch ng kumpanya. pagkatapos noon ay kailangan kong magtrabaho para sa regular na schedule ko bilang support - ang schedule ko ay 6 na araw na pasok (09:00 am -05:00 pm (am) at may isang araw na night shift 09:00 pm - 05:00 am respectively). sa unang araw ko, ang suot ko ay isang loose na sweater at mahabang skirt. bilang sa kaalaman ko ay sa ganitong uri ng trabaho ay karamihan mga lalaki ang empleyado, ayaw ko naman mag-cause ng unnecessary attention dahil sa provocatively o inappropriately pag-susuot ng hindi naayon na attire. ang lalaki sa front desk ay mukha namang maayos na tao. pinakilala n'ya ang sarili n'ya bilang si andrew bago n'ya ako tulungang mag-fill out ng mga paperwork at sinamahan n'ya na ako sa aking mesa at sa isang open space na workspace. nakatitig lang ako sa tila walang katapusang mga desks habang naglalakad kami, napansin ko na halos hindi mo makikita ang mga mukha ng bawat taong nagta-trabaho na naka-upo sa bawat desks. wala man lang akong nakita o napansin na babae habang nag-lalakad kami sa tila baga'y walang katapusang workspace na iyon, na talaga namang hindi normal at nakaka-bahala. kahit ang kalmadong presensya ni andrew ay hindi kayang maiwaglit ang wari kakaibang pakiramdam na naka-tuon sa akin. halos maubusan ako ng hininga ng maramdaman ko ang mga presensya ng bagong kong co-workers na tila nagsasabi na ""hindi ka nababagay dito"". nagulat ako ng biglang huminto si andrew sa isang desk na napuno ng mga printed memes, floral stickers, at isang lumang keychain na naka-patong sa harap ng monitor. bukod pa doon ay natatakpan na rin ng makapal na alikabok ang keyboard, monitor at ang natitirang ispasyo ng desk. ""ahhh... anong nangyari..."" sabi ni andrew sa medyo upset na boses. ""pasensya ka na."" sabi nito habang nakatingin sa aking mga papeles. ""ah... aya. dapat matagal na 'tong nalinis. kailangan kong maka-usap ang custodian"". ""ok lang 'yun"", sagot ko. ""puwede ko namang punasan na lang 'yan, wala namang problema"". medyo asiwa na noon si andrew, pero habang ginagala ko ang aking paningin ay malinaw na wala ng ibang bakanteng desk maliban doon. mabilis na natapos ang araw na iyon. natutunan ko na ang mga dapat kung gawin na sumagot sa support related phone calls at gumawa ng bagong ticket para sa system. kailangan ko ring i-monitor ang lahat ng pumapasok na chats at written tickets at isaayos ito base sa level ng urgency at type nito. hindi naman ako required mag-bigay ng technical advice, pero dapat maging pamilyar ako sa aming product software. bilang wala pa namang mga tawag ay pinaki-alaman ko muna ang manual. halos wala akong maintindihan sa mga naroon kaya naman ginogle ko na lang ang karamihan na nasa manual. kinumusta ako noon ng manager ko at mukhang hindi s'ya masaya sa mga lapses ko sa mga materials. dahil pakiramdam ko wala akong matinong nagawa at gagawin sa mga oras na iyon ay panandalian akong nag-break para linisin ang mesa ko. tumayo ako para tanungin si andrew kung saan makaka-kuha ng basahan para sa mesa ko. agad-agad kong pinagsisihan ang desisyon kong iyon. ang bawat mata sa kwarto ay tila napako sa pagtayo ko sa aking kinauupuan. hindi ako sigurado pero maraming mga bulungan akong narinig habang papalayo ako sa aking mesa. ang kaninang maingay na mga keyboard ay pahina nang pahina na halos kainin na ako ng lupa sa sobrang hindi ko pagiging kumportable at self-conscious na rin at the same time. napansin ko na lang na halos halikan ko na ang dibdib ko sa pagyuko para lang hindi ako mapansin. bago ako maka-rating sa isang palikong daan patungo sa front desk ay buong-lakas kong tinignan ang isang tila walang hiyang lalaki na nakatitig sa akin. hindi ko alam kung ano ang inaasahan ko, pero 'yung overall appearance ng lalaking naka-hooding pang-asar na 'yun ay nagbigay ng matinding kilabot sa buong katawan ko. siguro mga ka-edad ko s'ya pero hindi man lang s'ya nahiya o natinag sa pagkaka-titig n'ya sa akin sa kabila ng pagtitig ko sa kanya na may halong pagka-bwisit at inis. isang kakila-kilabot na ngiti ang sumilaw sa mga labi nito habang naka-titig sa parteng bukong-bukong ng aking mga paa at dahan-dahan itong bumalik sa kanyang monitor. inisip ko kung anong magiging reaksyon n'ya kapag tinitigan ko rin ng kaparehong paraan ng pagtitig n'ya sa akin ang tinitigyawat n'yang leeg. parehong reaksyon pa rin ang nakuha ko habang naglalakad ako pabalik sa aking mesa kasama ang box ng computer wipes sa mga kamay ko. may maganda ring nangyari sa araw na iyon. habang nililinis ko ang mga drawer ng mesa ko ay may nakita akong half-used notebook mula sa nakaraang nagta-trabaho sa mesa ko. hindi n'ya nilagay ang first name n'ya, kundi initial lang at last name: j. espiritu. pero, base sa dekorasyon ng notebook, sigurado ako na babae rin s'ya kagaya ko. ang mga naiwan n'yang gamit ay nagbigay ng kapanatagan sa akin, pero 'yung notebook ang talagang pumukaw ng atensyon ko. doon ay sinabi nito ang pina-ikli at simpleng manual gamit ang easy-to-undertand terms at mga explenasyon sa nakaka-litong terminolohiya at komplikadong panuto sa manual. sa tulong n'ya ay nasurpresa ko ang aking manager sa aking product knowledge pagkatapos ng shift ko. matapos ang isang magandang araw ay buong tapang akong gumala sa office at nag-explore sa pantry. binenta ni andrew sa akin ang top-notch coffee machine at snacks sa nasabing pantry, tutal nagugutom na rin naman ako matapos ang isang emotionally, intellectually and productive na araw na 'yun. (ansabe). tsaka, medyo butas na rin 'yung bulsa at namumula na ang mga credit cards ko, kaya naman ayos na ako sa ilang pirasong masasarap na cookies. habang papalapit ako ay may narinig akong malakas na usapan at tawanan sa pantry. sa katangahan ko ay inisip ko na baka naman mas mainit, friendly o kahit maka-tao na sila sa akin. subalit ang maliit na pantry ay napuno ng katahimikan the moment na pumasok ako sa pantry. may limang lalaki doon na mag-kakaiba ang edad at lalaki na naka-upo sa palibot ng isang maliit na lamesa, at lahat sila ay naka-titig na direkta sa akin. ""panget na araw?"" - tugon ng isang pang-asar na boses. agad kong itinaas ang ulo ko mula sa pagkaka-titig sa sahig para hanapin ang pinag-mulan ng boses. hindi naging mahirap sa aking hanapin at malaman na mula iyon sa naka-hoodie na walang-hiyang tumitig sa akin nung nakaraan lang. ""siguro marami ka ng experience?"" - sambit pa nito sa nakaka-asar na tono at may-unting pag-taas ng kilay. ""para makakuha ng komportableng trabaho. siguro sikat ka?"". ""ano 'to, high-school?"" - sagot ko sa malakas na boses. hindi ko hilig kumompronta ng tao, pero sobra na 'to. hostility is one thing, social awkwardness is another, pero pakiramdam ko isa 'tong 80's na high-school drama na mga trenta anyos ang mga bida bilang mga teenagers. ""nandito lang ako para kumuha kape at kung may problema ka sa trabaho ko, puwede mong dalhin sa hr kung ano man ang issue mo"". nagpatuloy ako habang ine-enjoy ang namumutla at pahiyang mukha ng mga taong 'yun. mabuti naman, gusto kong maramdaman nila ang katiting na discomfort na buong araw kung kinakaharap. pinili kong lumayo sa aking mga co-workers, naglakad ako ng taas noo pabalik sa mesa ko na may hawak-hawak na tasa ng kape. bago pa ako maka-upo at enjoyin ang masarap na kape, napansin kong may isang mensahe galing sa hindi kilalang number: ""you have quite an attitude, don't you?"" nanigas ako habang hawak ang cell phone sa isa kong kamay at kape sa kabila. habang prino-proseso ko ang tila breach sa personal security ko, naka-tanggap ulit ako ng dalawa pang mensahe. isa ay ang hubo't-hubad kong katawan na sinend ko sa una kong serious college boyfriend. ang pangalawa: ""bakit hindi mo ngayon ibigay 'yang picture sa hr?"" sa totoo lang, sobrang naapektuhan ako sa invasion ng privacy ko. pumasok ang kahihiyan sa akin at sobrang naiinis ako for drawing so much unwanted attention sa sarili ko. kasalanan ko lahat 'to. pumasok ako sa isang office na puno ng ethical hackers na may pare-parehong pangalan ng aso bilang password. walang duda na ang litratong iyon ay umiikot na sa buong office at lahat ng iyon ay salamat sa walang hiyang ka-trabaho ko, at isa na akong kakatuwang tao sa loob ng office. hindi ko na ginalaw ang kape ko at umuwi na lang, habang pinipigilan ko ang bawat emosyon na bumuhos hanggang makarating ako sa safety ng bahay. halos hindi ako matigil sa kaiiyak nung gabing 'yun, iniisip ko na ang mga mukha ng mga ka-trabaho ko habang tigang na tigang na nakatitig sa hubad kong katawan. mga alas tres na ng madaling araw, doon ko lang na-realize na wala ng kwenta para pa magpaka-lunod ako sa kahihiyan. kailangan kong gumawa ng plano para maka-survive sa ganitong uri ng workplace. quitting is not an option kasi masyadong malaki ang pasweldo nila para tumigil ako. tsaka, halos tinapay na lang ang kaya kong bilhin sa araw-araw. ang pangalawa kong option ay pumunta sa hr, but there's no way i was going to open that can of worms. hindi ko mapapatunayan kong sino talaga ang nag-send ng mga mensahe na iyon. last option? stick with it, keep my head down, gawin ang trabaho na pinasukan ko at 'wag pansinin ang iba pang mga harassment na gagawin nila. 'yun nga ang ginawa ko. sa kabuuan ng isang linggong training ko ay pumapasok ako on time, hindi ako umaalis sa desk ko liban na lang kung pupunta sa palikuran. iniwasan ko rin ang kahit anong contact kanino man at pinanatili ko lang ang aking mga mata sa mga inanimate objects. salamat kay j. espiritu, palagi akong on top ng training ko. sa bawat bagong task na galing sa manager ko, laging may katumbas na entry sa kanyang notebook. wala ng nakaka-gagong texts at face-to-face na kumprontasyon, pero mayroong kakatuwang pakiramdam na panibagong sisira sa kalagayan ko. sa darating na biyernes na ang huling training ko, na nagdala sa akin sa huling entry sa notebook. night shift survival guide: - matulog sa buong umaga bago ang shift at 'wag na 'wag kang matutulog. - walang sino man ang dapat maka-pasok. - panatilihing may pepper spray na dala. (sa kahit anong sitwasyon). - i-check ang bawat aisle, meeting rooms. huwag kalimutang i-check ang ilalim ng lamesa, balkonahe, kitchen tables at kahit likod ng cooler. - laging mag-open ng skype na naka-ready sa emergency in case na hindi gumana ang mobile services. - panatilihing updated sa kaibigan/pamilya/lover kada oras. ang nasabing listahan ay medyo may kahulugan. una, sabi ng hr puwede naman akong matulog sa pagitan ng 2-5 am, basta malapit palagi sa akin ang office smartphone. mayroon nga silang pull out couch sa isang conference room para lang talaga sa ganitong sitwasyon. pangalawa, ang buong shift ay phone calls, kaya palaging may paraan para maka-tawag mula sa office phone, tama? lastly, ang mga naka-outlined sa ""guide"" ay parang o.a at paranoid. siguro 'yung listahan ay satirical? (ewan ko). siguro si espiritu parehas kami ng pakiramdam tungkol sa mga tila patay gutom na mga asong cold-blooded na co-workers? pero 'yung isip ko nag-tatrabaho ng sobra-sobra para makita ang logic sa likod ng mga pag-iingat na ito. may kakatuwa akong pakiramdam na may importanteng impormasyon akong hindi nalalaman. lahat 'yun iniisip ko habang paalis ako ng bahay nung biyernes na 'yun, last day ng training ko. ""andrew"", - dahan-dahan akong lumapit sa kanya. ""puwede ba mag-tanong?"" ""sure thing"", - sagot n'ya na may maaliwalas na ngiti sa kanyang mga labi. ""nagtataka lang ako, bakit wala akong nakikitang ibang support agents. i mean, 'di ba dapat merong at least lima pang tao para ma-cover 'yung six-day rotation cycle?"" ""kailangan mong tanungin ang manager mo tungkol d'yan. most likely naka-kalat sila sa iba pang branch sa syudad. normal lang naman 'yun sa ganoong kaso"", - sagot n'ya. pakiramdam ko tapos na kami sa diskusyon na 'yun matapos s'yang bumalik sa final tasks n'ya para sa linggong iyon. ""meron bang ibang agent na nag-trabaho dito liban sa akin?"" - pagpapatuloy ko, dahil ganun na lamang ang kagustuhan kong malaman ang iba pang detalye sa babaeng nag-fill out ng notebook na s'ya namang ginagamit ko sa buong linggong iyon. ""oo, may isang babae na humawak sa posisyon mo ng panandalian"", - ani ni andrew, habang naka-titig pa rin sa screen ng kanyang screen. pero napansin kong tumigil na s'ya sa pag-tatype o pag-galaw ng mouse. wari ko ay naka-titig lang s'ya sa iisang spot sa monitor n'ya. ""andrew"", - nag-salubong ang mga kilay ko. ""sino 'yung nag-trabaho malapit sa main working space na talagang nakaka-inis? maputla, medyo payat, maitim at kulot na buhok?"" - tanong ko, habang nagpapaikot ng daliri sa bandang ulunan ko para i-describe ang pagkaka-kulot ng nasabing lalake. ""ah... si michael"", - sagot nito, napansin nito ang pagiging iritable ng boses ko. ""may problema ba? ginugulo ka ba n'ya?"" ""hindi"" - sagot ko, pero sa isip-isip ko ay nagtatalo na ang emosyon at sarili ko. ""have a good weekend, andrew"" ""ikaw din"", - sagot nito, halata na may pagtataka sa boses nito habang papaalis ako. sa buong weekend na 'yun ay binabalik-balikan ko ang mga nangyari sa akin sa unang linggo ko. pakiramdam ko may hindi sinasabi si andrew sa akin na importante. wala namang rason para maging iretable s'ya nung nabanggit ko 'yung babaeng nag-trabaho bago ako. may nag-reklamo na kaya kay michael dati? pu-puwede kayang si j. espiritu? si michael ba ang dahilan ng survival guide sa notebook? bakit s'ya umalis? napaka-daming teorya ang bumagabag sa buong weekend ko. bago ko pa nalaman, oras na para bumalik sa trabaho. ito ang araw na talagang sobrang daming trabaho. kahapon ay lunes, ang unang regular day shift. mabilis lang dumaan ang nasabing araw, habang aligaga ako sa pag-sagot ng tawag, recording, sorting at assigning ng dose-dosenang customer complaints sa system namin. hindi sapat ang salitang nasanay na ako at pagkatapos ng araw na 'yun ay sobrang pagod at ubos na ako. saktong maglo-logout na ako, naka-tanggap na naman ako ng mensahe mula sa hindi kilalang number. ""ang sipag mo naman. hindi na ako makapag-hintay na mag night shift ka"" seryoso?! ito ang kauna-unahang mensahe na bumalot sa buong pagkatao ko ng takot. agad-agad kong ginala ang paningin ko kung nasa paligid ba si michael para kumprontahin ko s'ya sa pagse-send ng mensahe, pero kanina pa pala s'ya umalis. matapos kong pakalmahin ang sarili ko, umuwi na ako at sinusubukan kong hanapin si j. espiritu online. ang pinaka best bet ko noon ay sa linkedin, at doon nga ay sinusubukan kong galugarin ang buong listahan ng mga babae na may kinalaman sa proficient technologies na naka-lagay sa profile nila (halos kakaunti lang talaga sila). nung wala akong makita ay pumunta ako kay andrew at doon nga sa friend list n'ya ay sa wakas nakita ko na ang hinahanap ko. may babae na pangalan ay jennah espiritu at unemployed ang status. nag-send ako ng friend request na may mensahe na nag-papakilala at tinanong ko s'ya kung hinarass ba s'ya ng isa n'yang ka-trabaho. sa wakas, pakiramdam ko may patutunguhan na ako, natulog ako at inihanda ang sarili para sa bukas na event. naisip ko na baka may kakaibang mangyayari dahil sa pagbabago ng schedule nung natulog ako ng miyerkules. nag-check ako ng linkedin halos pagka-gising ko mga ala una. walang kahit anong sign kay jennah, kaya naman natulog ulit ako para makapag-handa sa night shift. medyo kinakabahan ako at excited at the same time kasi puwede ko ng mas malibot ang buong place of work ko intimately. dahil walang day crowd, malaya akong makaka-gala at ma-eenjoy ang cookies, dumura sa baso ni michael, kahit ano! may mga iilan pa ring mga nag-tatrabaho nung dumating ako para sa shift ko, pero hindi ko naman iyon pinansin at dahil sa nag-uumapaw na mga tawag at chats na aasikasuhin. makalipas ang dalawang oras, ang bugso ng mga tawag at chats pati mga tickets ay unti-unting bumagal hanggang tuluyan na nga itong tumigil ng sabay-sabay halos alas onse na ng gabi noon. sumandal ako sa kinauupuan ko at ginala-gala ang mga paningin sa aking workspace. wala ng tao noon sa office at least sa nakikita ko. naka-bukas ang lahat ng ilaw pero nung tinanggal ko ang headphones ko, may narinig akong mahinang jingling melody sa hindi kalayuan. para s'yang christmas carol, pero hirap akong tukuyin kong saan ito nangga-galing. wala namang dahilan para matakot ako sa pangyayari, pero pakiramdam ko ang mga nagtayuang balahibo sa mga kamay ko ay nagsilbing alarm. nang tumayo ako sa aking kinauupuan, nawala 'yung melody. well, naging paranoid na ako dati. minsan ko ng inisip na na may lalaking sumusunod sa akin isang gabi hanggang nilagpasan n'ya ako at nagtungo sa kalapit na tindahan sa 'di kalayuan. kahit mag-isa lang ako, lagi kong dino-double at triple check ang mga lock ng bahay bago matulog. aaminin ko na ang mga takot ko ay wala naman talagang basehan. mayroong naka-iwan ng headphones na konektado pa rin sa computer nito at naka-on ang music. o siguro may office party sa ibang kumpanya sa baba ng building. ang makarinig ng kanta ay nakaka-takot lamang sa mga kakatuwang horror movies, 'di ba? 'di ba?! para maka-siguro, hinalughog ko ang office para maka-siguro na mag-isa na nga lang ako. habang naglalakad sa gitna ng mga magkaka-dikit na desks, naisip ko kung gaano ako ka-swerte na mayroon akong sariling corner spot. hindi ko siguro kakayanin na mapalapit sa kahit sinong mga hindi kaaya-aya kong mga co-workers. matapos ko ma-check ang bawat rows ay dumiretcho ako sa front desk area at nagmamasid sa mga kagamitan ni andrew sa paghahanap ng clues. nung wala akong makitang clues ay bumalik ako sa main room ng pantry. unti-unti ng mas nagiging relaxed ang mga senses ko at tsaka ko lang napag-tanto na napasarap ata ang taste-testing ko sa mga cookies sa halip na mag-hanap ng mga kahina-hinalang mga bagay. kailangan ko ng tumigil sa kaka-kain ng cookies, pero dahil bumalik na naman ang kaninang tunog na naririnig ko, mas malakas s'ya ngayon. at the same time, ang work smartphone ko (na kinakailangan dala-dala namin kung aalis kami sa aming work station) tumunog at may mensahe mula sa hindi na namang kilalang number. so, nag-eenjoy ka ba sa cookies, ha? nanigas ang buong katawan ko habang prino-proseso ng utak ko ang mga pangyayari. siguro hindi talaga umalis ng office si michael at ngayon tinatakot ako. kinalikot ko ang tenga ko noon at nakinig ng maigi. walang kahit sino sa pantry as least sa nakikita at naririnig ko. tsaka, kung si michael ay nasa main workspace, hindi naman ganun kahirap na hulaan o sabihin na kumakain ako ng cookies. habang dahan-dahan akong humihinga, hindi ko muna pinansin ang tunog at nakinig ako ng maigi kung may iba pa akong tunog na maririnig. wala. dahan-dahan, naglakad ako sa may pantry drawers at doon may nakita akong malaking kutsilyo. alam ko bang gumamit ng kutsilyo? hindi. kaya ko kayang paalisin kung sino man ang unarmed na kalaban? syempre. papunta na sana ako pabalik sa aking work station ng biglang may tawag na pumasok mula sa work phone. ipinosisyon ko ang sarili ko ng kumportable sa pader ng pantry, kutsilyo sa kanang kamay, cell phone sa kabila, bago pa ako maka-sagot with the standard customer support greeting. nag static na sa kabilang linya at iba pang ingay sunod ang tuluyang pagka-putol ng linya at katahimikan. nung tinignan ko ang cell phone, nakita kong naka-patay na ito. sinubukan kong buksan ulit ito, pero hindi na ito gumagana. ok, ngayon kailangan ko ng bumalik sa computer ko in case na may pumasok pang mga tawag. naalala ko bigla ang isa sa mga guide na galing kay jennah habang isinusuksok ko ang walang kwentang cell phone sa bulsa ko. - laging mag-open ng skype na naka-ready sa emergency in case na hindi gumana ang mobile services. nangyari rin kaya 'to sa kanya? ang mga instructions sa notebook ay unti-unti ng nagkaroon ng kahulugan, at minumura ko ang sarili ko dahil sa pagiging tanga. sa oras na lumabas ang mga salita sa bibig ko ay may isa na namang mensahe ang dumating sa cell phone. kinuha ko iyon at sinubukang i-unlock, pero 'yung regular home screen ay hindi lumalabas. ang lumabas lang ay isang white screen na may maikling text. putang ina. ang mga babae dapat hindi ginagamit ng ganung mga uri ng salita. matapos kong mabasa 'yun ay nawala na ito sa screen at may panibagong text ang lumabas. bakit hindi ka lumabas at makipag-laro? huwag mo ng isiping bitbitin pa 'yang kutsilyong hawak mo. wala ring magagawa 'yan sa hawak kong baril. tinapon ko ang cell phone ko sa lapag at agad-agad ay nagtungo ako sa aking computer. ang tunog ay mas lalong lumakas habang papalapit ako sa aking lamesa, doon ay nakita kong may isang baboy na stuffed toy. may fabric button ito sa bandang paanan at music note na kasama. dito nagmumula ang tunog at nagpapatunay lamang na hindi ako mag-isa at may kung sino akong kasama. ang malala pa, pinapanood nila ang bawat galaw ko at sinusubukang takutin gamit ang mga laruang pambata. unti-unti ng dumadaloy ang pagpapanic sa aking buong katawan at naghahanda na sa fight or flight scenario. huminga ako ng malalim, sinusubukan kong pakalmahin ang buong katawan ko. so far wala pa naman akong naririnig ng kahit anong palatandaan na may ibang tao sa loob ng office. may mga background noises galing sa syudad sa labas at ang mga ingay mula sa naka-limutang patayin na computer ng isang employee. kung sino man ang gumagawa nito sa akin, kailangan kong malaman ang kanilang eksaktong lokasyon para maplano ko ng maayos ang pag-takas ko. isa pa, kailangan kong maka-kuha ng tulong sa lalong mas madaling panahon. habang iginigilid ko ang laruan ay umupo na ako sa aking upuan at pinull-up ang skype for business application. mabilis akong nag-dial ng 911, habang naka-loudspeaker ang telepono. tumunog na nga ang dial tone at agad-agad ay may live operator na sa kabilang linya. ibibigay ko na sana ang mga hindi kanais-nais na pangyayari sa akin ng mga oras na iyon ng may biglang humawak sa bukong-bukong ko mula sa ilalim ng lamesa. halos maubos ang buong lakas ko sa pagsigaw habang nagpu-pumiglas ang mga paa at mabilis na tumakbo sa abot ng aking makakaya sa bilis na hindi ko akaling kaya ko. may narinig akong kung anong kumusyon sa aking likuran habang tumakbo, kasunod ng isang malakas ng putok, na inisip ko na lamang na galing sa kung ano o sino man ang humahabol sa akin. bago ko pa malaman ay halos nasa ground floor na ako papunta sa pinto lagpas sa gwardiya na halatang nagulat sa mga nangyayari. ang malamig na hangin ay mabilis na pumasok sa manipis kong sweater habang papalapit ako sa isang malapit na pedestrian para humingi ng tulong. tumawag sila ng 911 at ang mga pulis ay agad namang dumating wala pang sampung minuto. habang naghihintay ako kasama ang gwardiya para sa kanilang pag-dating, hindi maalis sa isip ko ang sinulat ni jennah na warning, at kung gaano ako ka-tanga para ipagsa walang bahala ang mga ito. - i-check ang ang bawat aisle, meeting room. huwag kalimutang i-check ang ilalim ng lamesa, balkonahe, kitchen tables at kahit likod ng cooler. agad-agad namang sinulat ng pulis ang mga nangyari sa akin at iniwan ako kasama ang isang pulis officer, umakyat s'ya para i-check ang office. wala namang naka-labas-masok sa building mula nung tumakbo ako palabas, kaya malaki ang posibilidad na naroroon pa rin ang salarin at nagtatago sa loob. sa pag-iisip ay halos bumaliktad ang buong sikmura ko at mas lalo akong lumapit sa may armas kong kasama. maya-maya pa matapos kaming iwanan ng mga pulis, ang kasama kong pulis ay nag-radyo at isa-isa may mga boses na nagpapa-palit-palit sa radyo na humingi ng backup at nga mga codes na hindi ko maintindihan. mabilis na nag-escalate ang mga sumunod na pangyayari. imbis na pauwi ay dinala nila ako sa police station at doon ay nanatili ako sa isang interrogation room ng halos 2 oras bago pa sa wakas may dalawang pulis officer ang kumausap sa akin. pagod na ako noon, miserable ang kalagayan at higit sa lahat litong-lito sa kung papaano naganap ang mga pangyayari. gusto ko ng umuwi pero nanatili pa ako ng ilang oras para i-kuwento ang mga pangyayari sa dalawang pulis officer. 'ahh... meron kang kutsilyong hawak habang tumakbo ka galing sa pantry papunta sa lamesa mo? sigurado ka ba?' tanong ng isang nakaka-tandang officer na nagpakilala bilang senior investigator manlapig. 'ah. ah... oo.' pautal-utal kong sagot sa kanya. 'naniniwala akong meron. nag-papanic na ako noon, kaya mahirap sabihin. tapos may baboy na stuffed toy, ' sabi ko, habang tila baga'y nawawalan ako ng abilidad na mag-isip ng tama. 'at naniniwala ka na ang taong humaharass sa'yo ay si michael villareal?' sabi ng isa pang officer, hindi ko maalala 'yung pangalan n'ya. wala s'yang badge. 'hindi ko alam buong pangalan n'ya, pero wala na akong ibang kilala na iba pang responsable.' 'at sa huling pagkakataon, just for the record, anong nangyari matapos mong mag-dial ng 911?' tanong ni manlapig sa ika-apat na pagkakataon sa gabing 'yun. 'may kung sino ang humawak sa binti ko. bukong-bukong, actually. nangyari 'yun bago pa ako magkaroon ng pagkakataong ipaliwanag ang sitwasyon sa operator. nagsusumigaw at piglas ang mga paa ko tapos tumakbo hanggang may makita akong tao sa labas na pina-tawag ako sa 911 para sa tulong.' sagot ko, habang pagod na pagod sa paulit-ulit at paikot-ikot na pagtatanong. 'si michael villareal ay natagpuang patay sa hindi kalayuan ng iyong lamesa nung pumunta ang officer namin sa pinang-yarihan ng insidente. nakita mo ba ang kanyang katawan nung tumakbo ka palabas ng office?' tanong ng isang officer. halos malaglag ang panga ko sa mga narinig ko at tumitig sa dalawang pulis habang balisa at nanginginig sa takot. 'hi.. hi.. hindi,' pabulong akong nag-salita, 'hindi ko maintindihan,' 'sinaksak s'ya hanggang sa mamatay gamit ang malaking kutsilyo. ang katawan n'ya ay balot ng dalawampu't-tatlong saksak,' paliwanag ni manlapig. 'at nakita namin ang kutsilyo ay nakabaon sa bibig nito, dahilan para dumikit ito sa sahig diretcho sa lalamunan,' 'may rason kami para pagsuspetyahan na ito rin ang sinasabi mong kutsilyo,' dagdag pa ng pangalawang officer. nakatitig ako sa dalawang pulis officer ng tahimik, hirap akong intindihin ang mga pangyayari lalo na't ang utak ko ay halos mawala na sa ulirat. 'ang mga sinabi mo ay nagpapatunay lamang sa mga natagpuaan namin sa cell phone ni michael villareal. nalaman namin na may roon siyang hacking apps,' pagpapatuloy ng senior officer. 'natagpuan din naman ang ilan mo pang mga hubong larawan at ang mga mensahe na iyong nabanggit. mayroon s'yang baril at nakita rin naman ang basyo ng bala nung binaril ka n'ya habang papatakas ka.' 'ang hindi namin maintindihan ay kung papaano s'ya namatay.' dagdag pa ng pangalawang officer, halatang hindi s'ya naniniwala sa aking reaksyon. 'ok lang kung napatay mo s'ya dahil sa self-defense, aya. may balak s'yang masama sa'yo.' 'hindi,' pautal-utal kong sagot. 'pangako, wala akong ideya... oh, oh my god.' naiyak na ako dahil sa mga nangyayari. 'ibig kong sabihin, nung nakaraang buwan lang may nag-report sa kanya galing sa isa n'yang co-worker,' sabi ni manlapig. 'jennah,' bulong ko. 'kilala mo si miss espiritu?' tanong ng pangalawang officer, at ng suspetya sa kanyang mga mats. 'hindi,' ako ang pumalit sa lamesa n'ya at nakuha ko ang notebook n'ya. dapat sinabi ko na 'to kanina pa. anong sabi sa report? doon nga ay nagtitigan ang dalawang pulis at maka-lipas ang ilang sandali ay inilatag at ipinaliwanag ni manlapig ang mga hindi magandang nangyari kay jennah na halos mangyari na sa akin. si jennah espiritu ay dumiretcho sa pinaka-malapit na hospital mula sa kanyang unang night shift tatlong buwan na ang nakakaraan. sobrang bugbog ng katawan n'ya at sugatan, at gustong mag-file ng anonymous rape kit. ang natanong damage n'ya sa kanyang puwerta ay sobrang severe na kinailangan n'yang sumailalim sa operasyon at magpatahi. nag-file s'ya ng police report makalipas ang dalawang buwan matapos s'yang hindi pumasa sa probationary period sa inyong kumpanya, ng nawala s'ya sa trabaho (ang nagiisang paraan para mabayaran ang kanyang utang sa hospital). ang nangyari ay ang kanyang aligasyon kontra kay michael villareal, na gumastos s'ya ng malaki sama mo pa ang hindi mabilang na kanyang mga co-workers na kumontra sa kanya laban sa magalang at kaaya-ayang katangian ni michael. 'pero kahapon lang ay iniurong na n'ya lahat ng mga isinampa n'yang kaso kay michael,' sabi ng walang badge na pulis. 'kasalukuyan naming inaalam ang kinaroroonan ni espiritu para ma-interview namin s'ya. sigurado ako na ngayon malinaw na kung bakit may suspetya kami sa iyo bilang nakikilala mo espiritu.' nagpatuloy ang mga tanong ng dalawang pulis hanggang may isang lalaki na nag-abot sa kanya ng isang sobre. natukoy na ng forensics ang fingerprint na nakita sa kutsilyo at ang blood-spatter patterns. kinailangan ko ring mag-submit ng dna samples para maka-tulong sa imbestigasyon at sa wakas ay pina-uwi na nila ako. sa bahay, dahil sa sobrang pagod, hindi ako maka-tulog. wala akong gamit na naiuwi. bag, cell phone at kahit ang jacket ko ay kinailangan i-submit bilang ebidensya. kaya naman napilitan akong gamitin ang luma kong laptop, umaasa na malibang sa internet. ang browser ko ay naka-login pa rin sa linkedin account ko mula sa nakaraang login, at nirefreshed ko ang page bilang naka-sanayan. isang maliit na red icon ang lumitaw na mayroon akong bagong mensahe. jennah. nagre-reply na s'ya sa akin. don't worry, sis. i took care of it. ❤️",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/t77k69/tagalized_story/,5 03 2022

""gusto mo bang kumita ng 1000 pesos per night bilang security sa morge? apply na!"" medyo matagal na rin akong walang trabaho at makaka-bayad na rin ako ng upa at makapa-mamumuhay ng maginhawa kung magkataon. kaya naman nag-apply ako kahit medyo nag-dalawang-isip, inaasahan ko nang hindi ako makaka-kuha ng kahit anong sagot mula sa kumpanya. pero wala pang dalawang oras ay may natanggap akong email mula sa employer: ""maraming salamat sa ipinasa mong application form para sa posisyong night guard sa morge. masaya kong ibinabalita na ang mga skills na iyong binanggit ay tugma para sa hinahanap namin sa isang guard at gusto kitang offeran ng isang taong kontrata. kung ika'y sumasang-ayon sa mga kasunduan sa ibaba, maari lamang mag-iwan ka ng signature online via e-signature na naka-lista sa baba at pumunta ka sa (redacted) eksakto alas diyes ngayong gabi. makaka-tanggap ka ng 5000 linggo-linggo na direkta sa iyong bangko."" ngayong gabi? hindi ba masaydong mabilis ang mga pangyayari? pero hindi na ako nag-reklamo o tanong pa. hindi ko alam kung anong aasahan o kung sino ang madadatnan ko doon, kaya sinuot ko na 'yung damit at pantalon ko at agad nagtungo sa nasabing address nang mas maaga sa itinakdang oras. nandoon na ako ng mga alas nwebe kwarenta 'y singko ng gabi at may isang middle aged na lalaki na mukhang nag-tatrabaho sa morge ang bumati sa akin. ""hi, michael, tama? ako nga pala si james."" - doon ay nag-kamayan kami at nag-kangitian - ""alam ko na pinapunta ka dito sa kabila ng maikling abiso, pero sadyang nanganga-ilangan ng bagong gwardiya ang kumpanya na nag-hire sa atin dito agad-agad para ngayong gabi."" ""edi padala ako mula sa security company sa morge n'yo?"" - tanong ko. ""tama ka. nagta-trabaho ka sa isang outsourcing security company at sa alam ko, malaki sila mag-bayad. malay mo, mas maging mataas pa ang posisyon mo sa hinaharap."" - sabay kindat. ""ok. ano naman ang mga trabaho ko dito..."" pagsisimula ko. ""ahh, 'yun. wala naman gaano, siguraduhin mo lang na walang makakapasok."" - lumapit s'ya sa akin at sinabing - ""o labas."" isang maikling katahimikan at nagtinginan kaming dalawa, doon ay napa-ngiti ito at ang sabi: ""de, joke lang. so ayun, tapos na 'yung shift ko, kaya naman mauuna na ako. basta doon ka lang sa office at mag-relax hanggang alas sais ng umaga. doon darating na 'yung kahalili mo."" at doon nga ay umalis na s'ya. umupo ako sa upuan sa may office. akala ko siguro naman walang hindi magandang mangyayari. may papel sa harap ko at habang tinitignan ko ito ay doon ko lang napagtanto na ito ay listahan ng mga rules na specifically naka-asign sa akin. ito ang sabi: sa bagong gwardiya. welcome to the company. sa baba ay ang listahan ng mga rules para sa iyong trabaho: 1. ang una mong dapat gawin ay ang mag-conduct ng full sweep sa buong area para siguraduhin na walang kakaibang mga nangyayari liban sa ordinary (pati sa crypt). important note: kung may katawan man na naka-labas sa chambers sa loob ng crypt, itulak mo lamang ito pabalik. dapat manatili silang nasa-loob sa lahat ng pagkakataon. 2. matapos ang buong sweep, maari ka nang manatili sa loob ng office hanggang matapos ang shift mo. may iba pang mga rules na naka-lista sa baba, pero nag-desisyon akong libutin muna ang buong lugar. medyo may kaliitan ang morge, may isang malaking medical room na halos mapuno ng medical supplies ang loob. pero may sapat na espasyo para sa 2-3 lamesa na puwedeng pag-lagyan ng mga labi. sa loob ng crypt ay may palikuran. nag-desisyon akong unahin na ang pinaka-ayaw kong lugar - 'yung crypt. umalis na ako sa office at binuksan ang solid at napaka-bigat na pinto ng crypt, agad-agad ay sinalubong ako ng napaka-lamig na hangin. sa loob, may dalawang katawan sa gitna ng kwarto at mga chambers sa pader. lahat naman sila ay sarado kaya naman mabilis akong lumabas ng kwarto. habang pabalik ako mula sa bathroom, may nakita akong lalaki na naka lab coat na naka-tayo sa gitna ng medical room. parang may kinakalikot gamit ang mga medical tools malapit sa isang body bag. ""tang... tinakot mo naman ako boss."" - sabi ko. tinignan n'ya ako na parang wala lang at bumalik sa ginagawa nito. ""akala ko umuwi na ang lahat. ako nga pala si michael, bagong gwardiya."" - sabi ko, gaya ng nauna, hindi n'ya ako pinansin. kumaway na ako at umalis pabalik ng office. babasahin ko na sana ulit ang mga rules ng biglang may matinis na tunog akong narinig na para bang may bakal na kumi-kiskis sa isa pang bakal na nag-eecho sa buong building. medyo mahina na ito at parang nang-gagaling sa mga tubo. tumagal din iyon ng ilang segundo at huminto sa kaparehas na segundo. hindi ko na lang pinansin at i-idlip na lang, check ng cell phone. pero medyo tumatagal na ang tunog at habang mas kinikilabutan ako ay unti-unti nang nagbabago ang kanina'y parang bakal na kumi-kiskis sa isa't-isa ay naging... ungol. lumabas ako ng office at tatanungin ko sana 'yung kaninang naka lab coat pero mukhang naka-uwi na s'ya sa mga oras na 'yun. hindi ako sigurado kung saan mismo nang-gagaling ang tunog, pero parang sa may crypt, kaya naman pinuntahan ko ito. 'yung oras na binuksan ko ang pinto ay ang buong building ay nanahimik. huminga ako ng malalim at napansin ko na 'yung isang chambers ay naka-bukas na ng bahagya. tinulak ko ito pabalik at agad-agad na bumalik sa office. nawala na ng tuluyan ang matinis na na para bang ungol na iyon. nagpatuloy ako sa pagbabasa: 3. maari kang matulog sa office, pero dapat handa ka sa mga mangyayari. sleep at your own risk, ika nga nila. matapos nun ay isang napaka-lakas na tunog ang halos mag-patalon sa buong pagkatao ko. ""tulong! palabasin n'yo ako dito!"" - ang boses ay tila nang-gagaling sa mga tubo. tumayo ako habang sobra ang kalabog ng dibdib ko. ""palabasin n'yo ako, hindi ako maka-hinga!"" - paulit-ulit na pagmama-kaawa ng boses na ngayon ay may kasama ng kalabog. binuksan ko ang pintuan ng office at sa hindi malaman na dahilan sa crypt nang-gagaling ang boses. nanginginig, pero binuksan ko ang pinto. ""buhay pa ako, isa itong pagkakamali! tulong!"" - mas lalong lumakas ang boses nung oras na buksan ko ang napaka-bigat at solidong pinto. ""asan ka?!"" - nanginginig akong tumingin sa paligid, habang ang walang humpay na tumatawag ang boses na may kasamang malalakas na kalabog. lumapit ako at unti-unting inilapit ang tenga para maka-siguro na ang bubuksan ko ay ang tamang chamber. ""buhay pa ako! utang na loob! ple----"" ang boses at ang mga kalabog ay daglian na lamang nawala nang biglaan kong binuksan ang isa sa mga chambers at sinalubong ako ng malamig na bangkay ng isang middle-aged na lalaki. tumayo lang ako doon, nakatitig sa bangkay, halos tumigil sa pagtakbo ang isip ko sa kung ano ang mga nangyayari. malinaw na malinaw kong narinig at naramdaman ko ang bawat kalabog nung oras na hinawakan ko ang hawakan ng chamber at para bang may kung sino man na bigla-bigla na lang nagpatigil nito. pinaglalaruan lang ba ako ng aking isipan? tinulak ko ang chamber pabalik at mabilis na umalis doon, nilock ang pinto ng office. iniisip ko na ang pag-aaply sa trabahong 'to ay maaring isang malaking pagkakamali. pakiramdam ko na nababaliw na ako, pero agad ko ring kinumbinse ang sarili ko na nasa ulo ko lang lahat ng 'to. nagpatuloy ako sa pagbabasa ng mg rules: 4. puwede kang mag-patugtog para maibsan ang katahimikan basta't hindi ito makaka-kuha ng atensyon sa labas. 5. kung may marinig kang hindi mo maipaliwanag na ingay galing sa may crypt, 'wag mo na lamang ito pansinin. 6. kung ang mga ingay na 'yun ay naging sigaw ng pagpapanic, gawin ang mga sumusunod: • kung ang mga sigaw ay mula sa babae, 'wag mo pansinin hanggang sa tumigil ito. 'wag na 'wag kang papasok sa loob ng crypt sa mga oras na nangyayari ito sa kahit anong dahilan. • kung ang mga ingay ay mula sa lalaki, hanapin ang pinag-mumulan ng ingay at hatakin ang chamber. dapat huminto na ang ingay pagkatapos mong mabuksan ang chamber. doon na nagtatapos ang page. nilapag ko na ang papel at dahan-dahang inilapat ang likod ko sa upuan. ala una na noon at nag-sisimula na akong antukin. maya-maya pa ay nagsisimula ng pumikit ang aking mga mata ng kusa. nagsisimula na akong mahulog sa panaginip nang biglang may mahigpit akong hawak na naramdaman sa likod ng aking balikat. sa sobrang gulat ko ay agad-agad akong napatayo at sinipa ang upuan. walang tao o kahit ano noong mga oras na iyon. hindi na ako inaantok nung mga oras na 'yun. tahimik na ang buong kapaligiran noon at nagpunta ako sa palikuran. pagbalik ko ay alas tres na at halos handa na akong tapusin ang shift ko dito. napagisip-isip ko na hindi na rin masama para sa isang libo, hanggang tinalikod ko ang papel na may mga rules at napansin kong may naka-sulat pa sa likod: 7. lahat ng staff ay lalabas o dapat nasa labas na ng building bago mag alas diyes ng gabi, kaya kung may makita kang lalaki na naka lab coat during your shift, 'wag na 'wag sa kahit ano mang sitwasyon na subukan mong makipag-usap sa kanya. paulit-ulit-ulit kong binasa ang rule ng limang beses, pero wala pa ring nagbabago sa naka-sulat. may mahinang katok sa pinto ng office. tinignan ko ito at sa likod ng salamin ay nakita ko ang lalaking naka lab coat naka-ngiti sa akin. alas kwatro 'y media na at patuloy pa rin s'ya sa pagkatok. sa mga magta-tanong, hindi ko na ho alam kung saan ko ito nakuha dahil 2018 ko pa po ito tinagalog. nakita ko lang na naka-save pa rin sa note ng selpon ko. salamat and ang init. tangina.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/t8j464/tagalized_morgue/,7 03 2022
"alex, tanghaling tapat ng sabado, 2021","(any review for this is very-very much appreciated. i'm an aspiring writer po and i just launched a passion project anthology, isa po ito sa mga kwento) &#x200b; **chairman** ngayon ko lang naranasan ‘to sa tagal ko nang nanunungkulan sa barangay. isama mo na sa mga karanasang ‘yon ang lahat ng away mag-asawa, suntukan ng mga lasing, at mga batang ginagahasa sa bukiran. pero eto… ngayon ko lang napansin na buong araw ko na palang hinihimas ang rosaryong nakasabit sa leeg ko. maya’t-maya ko pa hinahalikan at binubulungan na sana’y wag mangyari sa pamilya ko ang nakita ko kanina. naririnig ko pa rin ang sigaw ni cecil, kumare’t-kapitbahay namin, tanghaling tapat ng sabado, kung saan ang tanghalian sa buong kalsada nami’y naantala dahil sa kanyang nakakakilabot na sigaw. sa ilalim ng nagbabagang init ay nagsitakbuhan kami upang sumaklolo. kinailangan ko pang iwanan ang tinola ni misis at ang isang basong softdrinks na nilalanguyan pa dalawang yelo nang ako’y tumakbo papunta sa bahay ni cecil. ngayo’y hindi pa rin ako kumakain. sa totoo nga’y hindi pa ako nakakaranas ng gutom. hindi ko pa ata kaya. sa bahay ni cecil ay dinatnan namin ang katawan ng panganay ni cecil na si joe na nakaratay sa braso ng kanyang bunsong kapatid na si alex, sa sahig ng kanilang sala. sa leeg ni joe ay nakabaon ang basag na bote na ginamit ni alex na balot na balot sa dugo ng kanyang kapatid. agad ang kapit at halik ko sa aking rosaryo nang makita ko ang imahe; na parang sinaunang obra na naglalahad ng malagim na kwento. pero ano ang kwento neto? hanggang ngayon ay wala pa rin kaming ideya kung bakit. magmula sa pagsigaw ni cecil ng, “anong nangyari?! anak, anong nangyari?!” sa tulalang alex na nakatitig sa dilat na mga mata ni joe, hanggang sa pagpunta namin dito sa aking opisina sa barangay, ay wala pa rin kaming makuhang rason mula sa bakit. sa isang maliit na kwarto sa aking opisina’y pinaupo ko muna si alex. tulala at sinusubukang burahin ang dugo sa kanyang mukha gamit ang duguan ring damit n’ya. hinainan ko ng isang bote ng softdrinks at tatlong pandesal mula pa sa agahan namin kanina si alex, na agad namang n’yang kinain ng walang pag-aalinlangan. dito na nagsimulang gumapang ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod. isang kilabot na hindi ko maipaliwanag, habang pinapanood ko si alex na walang awat sa pagkain, habang ako’y hindi ko pa rin magawang matakam sa masarap na lutong nag-aabang sa’kin sa bahay. “alex,” marahan kong sinabi. “ba’t mo ginawa ‘yun?” tumingin lamang sa’kin si alex, patay na mga mata, bibig na mabagal ang nguya. at sa kanyang paglunok ay walang mga salitang bumalik sa’kin. hindi ko alam kung bakit pero bigla kong naalala si jefferson, isang tricycle driver dito sa’min. dalawang taon na ang nakakalipas nang mapatay n’ya ang isang dayo na nakaaway n’ya sa kalsada. nangyari ‘to nang kamuntikan n’yang makasalpukan ang sasakyan ng dayo, at nang nahinto silang dalawa’y nagkasagutan muna sila bago mapikon si jefferson. hinampas n’ya ng bakal na tubo ang dayo. hindi na raw n’ya napigilan dahil sa mga mapanglait na mga salitang tinawag sa kanya. bobo, unggoy, uling, mababa. labing-isang beses paulit-ulit na hinampas ni jefferson sa ulo ang dayo, at sa sobrang lakas ng bawat hampas ay may parte na ng utak na lumabas dito. sa prisinto’y naalala ko si jefferson, iyak nang iyak at humihingi ng tawad dahil sa nangyari. hindi makakain, hindi rin makatulog. nilamon na s’ya ng konsensya n’ya, at ang konsensya n’ya ang tumulak sa kanya na agawin ang baril ng isa sa mga pulis na nagbabantay, at iputok sa kanyang sariling ulo. nasaktan si jefferson, nagalit, at di nakapagpigil. naintindihan ko ang kwento ‘nun. pero bakit hindi ko maintindihan ‘to? alam kong magkasundo ang magkapatid na ‘to. alam ko kung ga’no sila kalapit sa isa’t-isa. kaya pa’no nangyari ‘to? ang kakaibang pakiramdam sa aking likod ay gumagapang paakyat hanggang sa aking dibdib, tila ba kumakapit ng mahigpit. pasikip nang pasikip at medyo nahihirapan akong huminga. ang kakaibang pakiramdam na ‘to’y tumitindi habang nanatiling tahimik at nakatitig lamang sa’kin si alex. biglang iniabot ni alex ang kanyang kamay at dito tumalon na ang puso ko. napaatras ako sa aking kinauupuan, at mabilisan kong hinugot ang aking rosaryo mula sa pagkakatago nito sa aking damit. itinutok ko ito kay alex, na walang ibang kibo kun’di ang kunin ang bote ng softdrinks na nasa harapan n’ya. mas bumilis pa ang pagkatok sa aking dibdib, na para bang kamuntikan na kong mamatay. habang si alex nama’y pinapanood lang ako habang patuloy ang kanyang pag-inom. wala nga ata talagang mangyayari, at nang maramdaman ko kung gaano katahimik ang kwarto’y kumalma na ako. bakit sa dulo ng utak ko’y hinihiling ko na may sapi o di kaya’y isang demonyo talaga ang kaharap ko, at sa presensya ng aking rosaryo’y masasaktan s’ya. kahit anong kakaiba. kahit ano basta magkaroon lang ng eksplenasyon ang nangyari. pero siguro’y kakaiba na rin ang ikinikilos ng bata. at siguro nga’y mas dapat talaga akong matakot sa buhay kaysa sa patay. **cecil** “saan ba ko nagkulang?” tanong ni aling cecil sa mga kumare n’yang nakapalibot sa kanya sa masikip na opisina ni chairmain. napapaligiran din s’ya ng makukulay na mga pamaypay na hindi sabay-sabay ang pagaspas sa harap n’ya; nilulunod si aling cecil sa hangin. ang kanyang mukha nama’y tila ba isang rebulto ng santo kung punas-punasan ng mga panyo. “hindi ko pa rin maintindihan,” dugtong n’ya. “hindi naman ako nagkulang sa aruga. pareho ko namang pinapakita sa kanila na pantay ang pagmamahal ko sa kanila.” tuyo na ang mga mata ni aling cecil, ngunit tila ba hindi pa rin tapos ang kanyang pag-iyak. “hindi sila nag-aaway. hindi ko man lang narinig na nagtalo silang dalawa. o kung may pagtatalo man, malamang sa malamang maliit na bagay lang ‘yun. hindi yung ikakamatay mo!” isang labi ng lumapit sa tenga ni aling cecil, “alam mo tingin ko, baka inggit ‘yan. kasi si joe lang may trabaho sa kanilang dalawa, di ba? tapos si alex, wala pa rin sa kolehiyo. nag-aaral pa rin. sigurado akong ‘yun ang dahilan.” isa pang labi ang lumapit sa kabilang tenga naman ni aling cecil, “baka napikon na. kasi di ba halos s’ya na sa lahat ng gawaing bahay? baka pakiramdam n’ya porke’t mas malaki ambag ng kapatid n’ya , alila na s’ya neto.” isang labi naman na kaharap ni aling cecil ang nagsabing, “baka nagbabait-baitan lang kasi nga si joe ang halos sumasalo sa mga bayarin, pati sa pag-aaral n’ya. pero galit talaga s’ya, kasi baka naman may pagkakataong mas nabibigyang-atensyon si joe kahit hindi n’yo napapansin. kasi halimbawa uuwi s’yang pagod galing sa trabaho, syempre di n’yo maiwasang alagaan, pagsilbihan.” sa gitna ng mga labing ito’y si aling cecil, at ang ideyang unti-unting nabubuo dahil sa mga sinasabi ng mga labi sa kanya. “siguro,” sabi n’ya. “siguro nga.” **abbie** ang pangalan n’ya’y abbie. social worker daw s’ya. pagpasok n’ya’y agad bumungad sa’kin ang asul na bra sa ilalim ng dilaw na blouse nang tapatan ito ng liwanag mula sa bintanang katabi ko. sa kanyang pagtali ng buhok ay nakita kong basang-basa na ang kanyang kili-kili at kumikinang na sa pawis ang kanyang leeg. “alex?” sabi n’ya habang maya’t-mayang tinutulak ng kanyang daliri ang salamin n’yang dumudulas sa kanyang matangos na ilong. “bakit di mo ikwento muna sa’kin ang nangyari bago tayo umalis dito?” pasensya ka na, abbie. hindi ko nagawang sabihin kay chairman, na kilala pa mandin namin. hinding-hindi ko rin masasabi sa’yo. walang ibang maglalahad ng nangyari kun’di ang mga taong nais magbigay kahulugan dito, kasi kung ako tatanungin kung bakit, sa totoo lang, hindi ko rin alam ang isasagot. may nabasag akong bote sa kusina kanina, at sa pagpulot ko nito’y pumasok sa isip ko ang isang udyok. yung tipo ng udyok kapag nasa mataas kang lugar, at bigla mo na lang gustong itulak ang kasama mo. pero alam mong hindi ito dapat gawin, at kakapit ka pa nang mas mahigpit sa kanila para masiguro mong hindi ito mangyayari. ang udyok na ito’y nagsabi sa’kin na isaksak ko kay kuya ang basag na bote. at nalaman ko na lang na totoo na pala ang lahat nang dumapo sa aking balat ang mainit na dugo ni kuya. nahinto lang ako nang maramdaman ko ang buto sa leeg n’ya at nang marinig kong nabibilaukan na s’ya sa kanyang sariling dugo. hindi ko pa rin alam kung bakit. sana, tulad ng iniisip ni chairman, ay nasapian na nga lang ako. pero nakita ko ang lahat, andun ako. hindi ko lang alam na totoo pala ang lahat. namatay si kuya joe sa wala. at hindi ko matanggap na wala. normal lang sana ang sabado namin. tahimik. nanonood lang si kuya ng tv, naglilinis ako sa kusina. si nanay nama’y namamalengke ng pananghalian namin. bicol express daw ang lulutuin n’ya. puta, sinira ko ang araw. gusto kong umiyak dahil hindi na kami babalik sa salo-salo namin. “alex?” muling tawag ni abbie. “gusto kong malaman kung bakit. tayong dalawa lang. kaibigan mo ko dito. hinding-hindi ko ‘to sasabihin sa nanay mo, sa mga kapitbahay n’yo. may mga naririnig ako sa labas na dahil daw sa inggit? totoo ba ‘to? sa inggit nga? magmula nang dinala ako ni chairman dito sa maliit na kwartong ito’y napagpasyahan kong manahimik na lang sa nangyari. sa ngayo’y nilalabanan ko ang mga luha, nilalabanan ko ang panginginig ng aking bibig, at ang mga salitang gustong lumabas mula sa’kin. dapat mukhang hindi ko pinagsisisihan. dapat mukha akong galit. para naman mabigyang halaga, mabigyan ng ibig-sabihin ang pagkamatay ni kuya joe. dapat tinatatak ko sa utak ko na dapat lang! dapat lang sa kanya ang nangyari. dapat hindi ako bibigay. dahil kapag natalo ako, mamatay talaga sa wala si kuya. “sige, kung ayaw mong magkwento, ako muna. kasi naalala ko ‘tong isang batang babae at ang tatay n’yang abusado. tatay n’yang lasinggero. tatay n’yang isang beses s’yang hinipuan sa kanyang sariling kwarto at pinilit. ampon ang batang ‘yon, at tatay-tatayan n’ya lang etong umaabuso sa kanya. takot na takot ang bata dahil pakiramdam n’ya isang gabi’y papatayin na lang s’ya bigla neto. kaya naman isang gabi, nang bigla s’yang pinuntahan ng kanyang tatay upang pagsamantalahan ulit, sinasaksak ito ng bata gamit ang lapis sa mata, sa leeg, at sa dibdib.” kumuha ng panyo si abbie. sa kanyang paggalaw ay muling sumisilip ang kanyang bra sa likod ng blouse na parang mga batang naglalaro sa likod ng kurtina. “masarap sa pakiramdam, pero pumapatay pa rin s’ya ng tao. ilan taon n’yang dinibdib ‘yun. hanggang ngayon nararamdaman pa rin n’ya ang mga kamay ng tatay n’ya sa kanyang ari. sa kanyang dibdib. ilang taon bago n’ya matanggap ang ginawa n’ya. ngayon, medyo mahirap pa ring ikwento, pero kahit papaano’y kaya ko na. nangyari na kasi.” para bang may sumuntok sa aking dibdib nang marinig ko ‘to. bigla kong tinanggal ang aking paningin sa kanyang bra, at sa paggalaw ng aking mga mata’y bigla kong naramdaman ang pamumuo ng mga luha. “ayos lang, alex. pero andito lang ako. aalagaan ka muna namin. tapos pag handa ka na, makikinig ako. kahit pakonte-konte pa, ayos lang. aantayin kong mabuo ang kwento mo.” bumibilis bigla ang tibok ng puso ko. lalong nanginginig ang aking labi. at biglang pumasok si kuya sa isip ko, tumatakbo papalayo sa akin. mga bata pa kami, at hinahabol ko s’ya. “alex?” kuya wag kang lumayo! “alex?” kuya dito ka lang! kailangan kita dito! “sige, ayusin na natin pag-alis mo.” at parang isang batang nadapa sa semento, dito na walang awat na tumulo ang luha sa aking mga mata. “alex?” “hindi ko rin alam… hindi… ko rin alam. sorry, kuya! sorry! hindi ko rin alam kung bakit! patayin n’yo na lang ako! hindi ko alam anong nangyari! hindi ko na kaya!” lumalabo na ang aking paningin, pero kahit ga’no kalabo ang aking mga mata’y kitang-kita ko ang gulat at takot sa mukha ni abbie. pasensya ka na, kuya.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/nlygsa/alex_tanghaling_tapat_ng_sabado_2021/,27 05 2021
REddit post,"hi guys. i do really want to ask help from you. i've been dealing with this for the last 10 years. sobrang pinapatay nako ng curiosity ko. it started when i was in grade 6. elementary, i am now 22 years old. 12 pako nong nagumpisang mangyare to. lets start pram da top, by the way, i had this classmate in elementary which is our class valedictorian. and then nagumpisa yong pagiging magkaaway namin when this happend. i know its gross but i saw him na umiihi kasi hahaha sa likod ng room namin though i didnt see anything. magmula noon, binablack mail niya ko sa mga kaklase ko na manyak ako blahblah. i know its so childish and all that. after that, lagi kaming nag-aaway. may mga times na kinukuha niya yong notes ko, yong bag, slippers ko tinatapon kung saan saan. sa putikan tapos sinusunog niya yong mga notebook ko. papampam ampota. tapos pnagtatabi kami lagi sa upuan, inaasar kasi para kaming aso’t pusa. nagsasakitan kami physically, lagi niyang dinadahilan na nagpapansin ako sakaniya which never happened. feelingero. may mga times nga na kapag natutulog ako sa room kukuha siya ng tubig ibubuhos sakin or wiwisikan niya ko ng tubig. kukunin niya yong song hits ko tapos ipapatubos, letche. then yong phone ko kukunin niya dedelete niya lahat ng contacts and messages ko. pero may times din nman na maayos yong utak niya, nong magkatabi kami noon. nagbibigay siya ng sagot sa ilalim ng table. i admit i am not that physically attractive, not the kind of girl na lilingunin mo pabalik. but despite that he is my enemy, never niya naman akong sinabihan ng kung ano ano, nilait or what not. he never did that. sometimes, pag npapaiyak niya ko yong nakikita mo sa mata niya na naaawa din siya. i don’t know with my instincts. i will also admit na masakit din ako magsalita kaya din siguro siya napipikon sakin kasi minsan sinasabihan ko siya ng ampon, kampon ni satanas or whatnot. and at that time, i am flirting with his brother, haha. katext ko kuya niya, tas pag sinusulat ko yong birthdate ng kapatid niya sa mga notebook ko lagi niyang pinupunit. always. cellphone ko, halos sinira niya. dumating din yong time na pinagalitan kami sa school, there was a time na sinabihan kami na kapag hindi pa titigil sa pagaaway. maaalis siya sa pagiging valedictorian tas ako makikick out. peste. baka ako lagi kawawa. so freakn unfair! i saw him crying, i really wanted to comfort him pero wag nalang. pero nagpatuloy pa rin nag anon, hanggang sa malapit na graduation namin may nakakita samin na nagsakitan kami tas sinumbong kami sa tita ko. eh maattitude yon, sinugod siya sa school and ever since that time hanggang nakagraduate kami eh hndi na kami nagpansinan. nong naging kami ni kuya niya sa text lang yon. it was a revenge. i know that was bad. there was a time na siya yong nakasagot ng phone, and he noticed my voice. akala ko non buking nako. but it never happened.. nakachat ko siya last 2017, yung kaklase ko dati. i guess, okay naman na kami even if walang sorry na nsabi sa isat isat. what bothers me the most is for the past 10 years halos lagi ko siyang napapanaginipan even if i am not thinking about him because i had his brother and i am deeply inlove with someone for 6 years which is not him. i am just really curios, bakit kaya? can you give me some of your advices, so that i can reflect into it. hindi ko talaga siya iniisip i swear pero halos lagi nalang. update: this really happens in real life. and last february 02/22/2022. nagchat ako sakanya using dummy account and i confessed then later on ginamit ko din real acct ko so he knows na. after that, diko na talaga siya napapanaginipan. i also saw him yesterday with a girl they're holding each others hand. and tbh, i didnt feel anything. like nothing at all, i was just shocked but im not hurt or anything. i can also attached screenshots if you guys dont wanna believe it. hindi kasi ako makapagreply sa mga comments thats why i just edit this post and its been two yrs na din pala. thanks 💓 and excuseee meee, im not 30yrs old or something 😒",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/m7oogm/reddit_post/,18 03 2021
Bakit 1am ang presscon?,"*“vico, mahusay. ito na ata ang pinaka epektibong solusyon sa ngayon. limitado ang ating kapasidad at kagamitan, pero nagawan ng paraan. mabuti.”* hindi ko masabi kung sino ang nagsalita. sumang-ayon lahat ng nasa mesa. nagsimula ang iba’t ibang maliliit na usapan, lahat papuri sa solusyong binigay ni vico. *“pangulong duterte, kayo po? ano po ang mabibigay nyong solusyon?”* tumahimik ang mesa. lahat sa akin nakatingin, naghihintay. *putangina, bakit ako magbibigay ng solusyon? trabaho ito ng mas nakabababa sa akin. bakit ako nandito?* humaba ang tahimik sa mesa. napapailang na ang iba sa kakahintay. unti-unting bumalik ang maliliit na usapan. hindi ko na marining ang pinaguusapan nila. hindi tumigil ang kanilang pagtingin sa akin. ang kanilang paghintay. *“ah-”* hindi ko namalayan na tuyo ang aking lalamunan at labi. hindi ko mailabas ang aking gustong sabihin. *meron ba kong gustong sabihin?* tumahimik uli. nagtaasan ang kilay ng iba. ako’y lubog sa lakas ng tibok ng aking dibdib. tuluyan silang tumitingin, naghihintay. *putangina.* dali-dali akong tumayo, diretso sa pinto papalabas. kailangan kong makaalis dito. *“pangulong duterte!”* sigaw nila. ngunit hindi na ako lumingon. sa labas, tirik ang araw. tahimik ang kalsada. nasaan ang jeep at taxi? nasaan ang aking kotse at driver? sa magkabilang dulo ng kalsada, wala akong makita kundi aspalto. *“pangulong duterte?”* nasa labas na lahat ng nasa mesa. lahat nagtatakang nakatingin sa akin. tumakbo ako papalayo. tirik ang araw. walang makitang katapusan sa aspaltong aking tinatakbo. *saan ako patungo?* hindi importante, basta makalayo sa kanila. bigla akong nadapa, mukha una sa mainit na kalsada. *paano ako nadulas?* malapit sa aking paa, may isang tsinelas. walang kapares. hindi ko maibangon ang aking sarili. tirik ang araw . . . biglaan akong napaupo sa kama. hirap ang paghinga, basang basa ng pawis. ilang segundong nawawala, lubog sa lakas ng tibok ng aking dibdib. dahan-dahang kumalma ng aking naalala kung nasaan ako. *panaginip?* tahimik ang kwarto, mahimbing ang tulog ng aking katabi. ako’y ligtas sa aking kama. ligtas sa aking palasyo. napapadalas ang masamang panaginip. *ano ang nangyayari sa akin?* tinignan ko ang orasan sa tabi ng aking kama, 12:50am. ilang oras pa bago dumating ang umaga, ngunit hindi ko na hahanapin yakap ng tulog. *pati ba sa ilalim ng aking mabibigat na mata, hindi ako makakahanap ng tahimik? tahimik nga ba ang hanap ko?* nag-ayos ng pwesto ang aking katabi. mahimbing pa din ang kanyang tulog. malalim. tahimik. ito na lamang ang magaan sa aking mabigat na isip. ang matahan na pagbaba ng kanyang dibdib. tila isang tanglaw ng araw na laging nasa aking tabi, kahit pa delubyo ang aking tinatahak. masakit na ika’y gisingin. ayoko. pero kailangan. presidente ako. responsibilidad ko ang pilipino. kailangan kong kumilos. unti-unti ko syang niyugyog pagising. *“bong.”* unti-unti syang namulat, nagtataka. *“bong go, gising na. magpapapresscon tayo.”*",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/flstoy/bakit_1am_ang_presscon/,20 03 2020
68 Spill-the-tea Pinoy showbiz edition (From March 2020). Can anyone confirm number 62?,"1. rico yan died from suicide. he knew about the score with claudine and raymart and claudine had to abort their child. rico couldn't handle the situation and went high on drugs. commited suicide afterwards. yun pala reason kaya galit na galit family ni rico kay claudine. 2. janella salvador is a lesbian. her mom is pretty awful to her as well. napaka inggrata namang iina eh anak niya naman ata source of income nila. i can understand if they want to hide it. being closeted is shitty but still understandable in this country. but why not let the girl be? hide it if they want for the sake of her career but don't supress it. let the girl sleep with other girls if that's who she is. kaya nagiging suicidal ang ibang lgbt kids eh. 3. atong ang and gretchen baretto sleeps together. tina tagle also hinted about it on her blogs. apparently atong also bangs claudine. 4. ruffa gutierrez is a paid high-end escort. also, they said that's the reason why ruffa ended up with bektas, a turkish 'mobster', due to this pimping business of anabelle. the sultan of brunei, bolkiah, had ruffa delivered to him at forbes park. 5. paul soriano was caught having an affair with erich. 6. (eto mas confirmed at open naman talaga) marjorie baretto is the mistress of echiverri. gretchen even alluded to it when she was on rage mode a few months back by saying that after clau and her, si echiverri nag paaral sa mga anak ni marjorie. 7. (open talaga) danding cojuangco's mistress for the past 20 years is aileen damileng, a former beauty queen. they have 2 daughters. you can see their photos all over her instagram. 8. kim domingo used to work for a club but strictly no touching/sex. apparently, manny pacquiao ""visits"" her on weekends. taas siguro ng fee niya ngayon. kim domingo is apparently a high end paid escort. she was anal-ed by ginebra's governor alfrancis chua which is why she got the stint to become ginebra's muse hahaha. 9. some say that 22 out of the 24 from the 24k girls of the show deal or no deal are high end escorts and use the show to market themselves with the assistant direk as the pimp. ang modus, may tatawag kay asst. direk after the show at mag tatanong kung pwede ibook itong si suitcase # whatever. think of it as an aquarium sa spa pero thru tv. pag uusapan nila ang presyo at may cut si direk sa ""talent"" fee nila. price range from 12k a night to 150k and some of the regular clients are high profile politicians. 10. most loveteams are fake/pilit. i remembered when the guy in a popular love team (james reid), naka sabay ko sa elevator sa condo. he is with this 'hot girl' they are ""sort of making out”. the girl she is with is ""way way hotter"" than his love team team. 🙂 kahit anung magazine pang mag sabi na sexiest yung ka love team nya. 11. liza soberano and enrique gil are also made up. 12. richard gomez had a light buld shoved up his ass back in the 90’s by either ben chan (owner of bench, and is why he’s always in every bench commercials back then), or jaime ayala. richard had to travel all the way to hong kong just to have his asshole stitched. 13. kris aquino had std courtesy of joey marquez (further reading here: 14. piolo pascual is gay. 15. angel aquino is bi/gay. 16. bea alonzo is/was bi (she had a girlfriend before). 17. alden richards is also on the list of closeted gay celebs. 18. sen. bong revilla tried getting cozy with ellen adarna using lewd text messages. he also did this to a couple of other women. 19. kat alano and mo twister had drunken sex. 20. model tina wells and michelle madrigal apparently had a one-night stand with kobe bryant. 21. manny pacquiao “gifted” erich gonzales to kobe bryant for a one-night stand. 22. hayden kho doesn't sleep with virgins. 23. list of vice ganda’s boys are: terrence romeo, zeus, ronnie alonte, and a few other uaap players. 24. halos lahat nang public tv show ng abs ay fixed. lalo na yun pbb. marami sa mga contestant don di naman nila nakuha sa wild. more than half don may backer sa abs. nagulat ba kayo bakit bigla nila tinangal yun ""live""? kasi kumakalat don baho nila. tignan niyo yun mga contestants, pagsikat na don lumalabas na modelo pala, mayaman pala. 25. sa abs may backer system don. kahit di ka talaga sumisikat, magkakaprojects ka pa din kung malakas backer mo. meron rin mga tao na magugulat kayo sumusulpot lang bigla pag birthday nila o kaya kakasal sila? sikat pa ba to bakit nila finefeature to? ang pangit umarte nito bakit kinukuha pa to? gotta ask yourself, ano kaya habol ng mga backer don? hehe. example: wenn deramas always had dj durano sa mga projects niya. 26. ung bigla nagbakasyon sa ibang bansa yun artista, maalki chance buntis yon. sa ibang bansa magpapalaglag. this is common in the industry. don't be fooled. buti pa yun isa no umamim. di na tuloy gumana yun bs machine nang abs pero sinubukan nila sa umpisa. umamim alng talga yun artista. examples are rhian ramos and kc concepcion. 27. nalala nyo yun anne curtis bar incident? totoo yon. galing nila no naginterview pa sila nang artista nila para ideny na nangyari yon kahit na nagsorry si anne curtis at maraming tao ang nakakita don? 28. halos lahat nang ""celebrity couples"" ay gimik lang. halos lahat don nagkadevelopan lang dahil ineecounrage sila na lagi dapat sila magkasama kahit saan. fixed rin yun mga overseas travels nila. pagpapakita nang pictures sa insta/twitter? all fixed. kuha kayo picture tapos smile kayo nang grabe tapos iupload niyo para makilig mga tungangerks. 29. drugs are rampant in the industry. kung meron dapat iambush ng drug test ang police, dapat unahin nila yun mga artista. despite the anti-drug craze, everyone knows that to survive the shooting hours and numerous gigs per day, kailangan mag-shabu ng ilang artista. si nora aunor nagkamali kasi dinala yung habit sa us e wala naman siyang influence dun. 30. willie is not that rich anymore. tanga to. umalis nang abs dahil kay jobert. malakas pa gumastos. may pera parin siya pero di na katulad nung nasa abscbn siya o earlyt tv5. ilang beses na sya binigyan ang chance ng panginoon pero matapobre pa rin. 31. jessy mendiola is/was the classic lopez girl. anyone who’s under the protection of lopez is untouchable. imagine the trade-off. 32. kc concepcion daw is nymphomaniac. 33. kc concepcion caught piolo and mark bautista having sex. that’s why they broke up. ito kasing si kc, ha, alam na niyang bading si piolo. nakipagbreak sa boyfriend noon at gustong gusto na may rebound na bongga. malakas nanay sa network, kaya ginawan ng love team. biglang naging sila daw, ano pa ba magagawa nung isa, kakalabanin mo ba si mega star sa network niya? mabait din kasi masyado itong si piolo, kaya pinabayaan na lang. ayaw lang kasi kumagat sa landi ni kc, hindi sanay si spoiled brat na hindi makuha ang gusto, ayun, nagiiiyak sa tv. kaya maraming bading sa showbiz na asar diyan. 34. mark bautista has a big bird for a pet. 35. yung si mimi ong na sumikat sa post nya tungkol sa expectations about guys, nag-e-escort service siya. minsan nakakabanas lang na puro sya preach about living independently and being financially stable pero yung means naman how to ""achieve"" it eh tagilid. may post pa sya na parang ""early gift to myself. iphone 8 plus 256gb."" aba talagang kasama pa kung ilan yung gb? 36. angel locsin costs 150k a night. ka-gym nung tito ko si bong tan. kwento nya one time nakasabay nila sa gym si angel locsin. nakita daw niya bigla lang pinasok ni bong tan yung kamay nya sa ilalim ng t-shirt ni al tapos hinihipuan. parang wala lang daw si angel. 37. gretchen fullido had a one night stand with craig david. paparazzis saw them checking in a hotel together. 38. joey marquez was caught borking benjie paras's former wife by the kids (jackie forster). this is why the paras brothers hate their mom with a vengeful fury. 39. jlc really wanted to preg ellen adarna. he saw it as a getaway ticket out of his contracts at star cinema (im quite happy for him and ellen). 40. may ""secret"" na kwarto sa abs-cbn na ginagamit ni lopez para sa mga bagong talents. 41. hiwalay si francis m at si pia at may ibang pamilya na siya bago mamatay. bumbibisita rin raw ang bagong gf ni francis m at the time sa ospital noong nakaconfine ito. pero hindi ko sure kung talagang hiwalay na sila. 42. erich & pacquiao, erich & drug lord, erich & old businessman. erich reaaaaally went around. 43. totoong rapist at manyak si vhong, alam ng lahat. rumor has it that he drugged deniece cornejo which is why her friends smacked him to bits. deniece is not the only woman he drugged and raped, look for kat alano. 44. richard guttierez (kapatid ni ruffa) was driving when he had an accident that killed his pa. his momager and network paid and fought tooth and nail to shut it down. the family of the pa was paid a hefty sum to withdraw the charges against the actor. 45. bianca gonzales' husband has a small dick according to ellen adarna (sinabi nya sa isang interview with mo). 46. perhaps everyone already knows that fhm doesn't pay for their cover girls. and these girls agree to be featured as sort of a promotion. 47. jojo veloso, serial rapist (for further reading: https://groups.google.com/forum/m/…) 48. maja salvador has halitosis. 49. marian locked bela padilla inside the cr, allegedly coz bela performed oral sex on dingdong. marian is not friends with any of gma’s top leading ladies (almost all of them has worked with dingdong) because of her paranoia. she's had confrontations with them accusing them of hooking up with her beau. 50. pia wurtzbach is rumored to be one of chavit’s women before. 51. si cindy kurleto madaming lisa (lice eggs or nits) sabi nung hairstylist sa isang shoot. pumuputok kasi kapag nag straightening iron ng hair. 52. ping lacson is gay. diether is one of his boytoy. miss ping has a kink in watching two actors do the deed. allegedly off’d some people too. the late senator mds was very colorful of her words for the gay senator. 53. joyce bernal and gil cuerva was caught having sex inside a car on the parking lot by mike enriquez. 54. from gtwm (good times with mo) podcast interview with osang. ted failon is well hung. philip salvador over acts like an action star in bed, with shouting and panget facial expressions. 55. kuya germs was allegedly a pedo/epheb. don't know if true, but his relationship with billy and jake were lowkey creepy nonetheless. 56. nagpabackround check ang family ni sarah genonimo kay matteo when it was discovered that he's from a wealthy clan in cebu. he passed “the test” kaya may “acceptance” na sya mula kay mommie divine. 57. open secret na marvin agustin is gay, right? but i remember my cousin telling me years ago na si angel locsin ang dahilan ng break-up ni marvin at pauleen. marvin allegedly got angel pregnant but she had aborted the baby. and it wasn't her first rodeo daw. i think it was around the same time na nag-out of the country siya for a while to take a fashion-related short course. remember that?? may nangyari ba sa tinake nyang course??? anyway, nalaman ng pinsan ko yun kasi naospital yata si pauleen non tapos chinismis yata ng tita ni pauleen yon to some nurses. tapos chinismis na ng mga nurses sa kasamahan nila. not sure if it was true though. 58. marky cielo committed suicide because his manager/handler refused to let him go kahit na nakipagbreak na sya. 59. jamila obispo the teen mom from pbb teens 1 is a thera/gro at airforce 21. 60. yen santos is chavit singson’s chick. there actually was a guy shot dead because he sort of courted yen. and nagpapagawa siya sa hometown niya now ng malaking building. 61. andre paras broke up with barbie forteza nung nalaman ni guy na si dennis trillo (ultimate crush ni barbie) ang nakauna kay girl. sabi sa blind item, underage si girl when dt took her virginity. 62. andrea brillantes and her ""dukit"" vid. sya talaga yun after a thorough forensic investigation by the socmed police. yung kwarto nya eh same na same dun sa featured segment nya sa isang tv show. nababalita pa na may bowa sya ngaun na anak ng 90's hunk actor. inuuwi nya daw yung guy (who's also underaged) at sa kwarto sila naglalaro ng jak en poy. walang magawa yung parents nya kase sya ang breadwinner ngaun. balita rin na sadyang ""mainit"" tong si andrea. check nyo nalang ig nya at matutunaw mga mata nyo 63. toni gonzaga and anne curtis smells garlic most of the time. staff and crew revealed amoy nilang dalawa, it was leaked years ago that both of them actually eat garlic as their snacks. 64. paul salas and barbie are both staying at a condo owned by paul. fans of their loveteam confirmed it! 65. darren espanto is bisexual 66. vice ganda gives food to participants in noontime show, it's showtime! one of the participants of tnt revealed that one time, vice got little mad to the staff whom forgot to distribute the food to participants. 67. daniel matsunaga won pbb due to budgetary constraints of the show. they let daniel won because madali lang ang negotiation of the prize, knowing that he entered late and he had his manager w/ him para iexplain ng production. 68. maymay entrata wanted to quit showbiz due to stress and uncomfortableness. bestfriend of maymay expressed her side about that matter on social media and was caught by the manager of maymay, it was then deleted.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/o0go1a/68_spillthetea_pinoy_showbiz_edition_from_march/,15 06 2021
